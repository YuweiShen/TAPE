This falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper also extends the theory of EasyCrypt, a framework for reasoning about cryptographic protocols, which could fall under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). The use of commitments as building blocks for other cryptographic constructions could also relate to categories such as computational complexity (cs.CC), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
