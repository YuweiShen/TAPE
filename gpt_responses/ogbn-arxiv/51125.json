The paper focuses on signals with 'simple' Fourier structure, such as bandlimited, multiband, and Fourier sparse signals, and shows that the sample complexity of signal reconstruction is tightly characterized by the statistical dimension of the allowed power spectrum of the signal class. The paper also presents a universal non-uniform sampling strategy that achieves optimal complexity for any class of signals. These results are based on a novel connection between randomized linear algebra and signal reconstruction with constrained Fourier structure. Based on these observations, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.SP (Signal Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
