This topic falls under the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The paper specifically focuses on ?-MontiArc, a language for describing architectural variability in a modular way, which falls under the programming languages (cs.PL) and software design (cs.SD) sub-categories. The paper also discusses applicability conditions for definedness of architectural variants, which falls under the logic in computer science (cs.LO) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a family-based analysis using inverse deltas, which involves some level of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
