The paper also involves the design of universal configurations, which can be seen as a problem in computational geometry (cs.CG) and combinatorics (cs.CC). The study of the complexity of motion planning in this model involves algorithmic aspects, which can be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
