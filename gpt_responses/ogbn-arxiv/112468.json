The use of pulse position modulation and ML decoding suggests a focus on digital signal processing and networking (cs.NI). The mention of delay error exponent and capacity per unit cost problem suggests a systems and control theory perspective (cs.SY). Finally, the paper's discussion of feedback connections may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
