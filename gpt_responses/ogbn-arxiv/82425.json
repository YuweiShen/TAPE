The system uses sensors to obtain information on the obstacle, which could involve computer vision (cs.CV) techniques. The problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) model, which is a common framework in reinforcement learning (cs.LG). Finally, the proposed system is designed to operate in uncertain environments, which could involve control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
