Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of designing efficient DNNs for edge devices, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality, which are related to the augmented reality (cs.AR) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses hardware acceleration and computational cost, which are relevant to the embedded systems (cs.EM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
