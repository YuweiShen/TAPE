Additionally, the paper also discusses the biases that humans and ConvNets develop in identifying facial features, which could be categorized under human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of Guided Backpropagation (GB) to visualize facial features is a machine learning technique, which could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of deep neural network-based models, which could be categorized under neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
