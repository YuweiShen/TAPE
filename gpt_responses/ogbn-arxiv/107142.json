Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also deals with the practicality principle in financial markets, which involves controlling both transaction and risk costs, making cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) a likely sub-category. The method also involves feature representation and analysis of asset correlations, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
