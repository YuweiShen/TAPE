The use of Horn constraints and SMT solving also suggests a connection to Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Software Engineering (cs.SE). The defunctionalization algorithm is a technique commonly used in Functional Programming (cs.FL), which is also relevant to the paper's focus on higher-order logic. Finally, the paper's use of formal methods and proof techniques suggests a connection to Computational Logic (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
