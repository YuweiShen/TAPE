The methodology proposed involves polynomial approximation and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), which are techniques commonly used in computational statistics (cs.DS) and data mining (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the estimation of entropy and mutual information, which are important concepts in signal processing and communication (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
