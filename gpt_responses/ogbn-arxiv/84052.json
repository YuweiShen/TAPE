This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and coding theory (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of markers and redundancy in code constructions, which are topics in distributed computing (cs.DC). Additionally, the paper analyzes the robustness of codes against edit errors, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the practical applications of the proposed codes, which is a topic in systems and networking (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
