The proposed method involves generating different views of the data by rotating it, and utilizing asymmetrical 3D kernels to encourage diversified features. The paper also proposes an uncertainty-aware attention mechanism to estimate the reliability of each view prediction with Bayesian deep learning. Given these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
