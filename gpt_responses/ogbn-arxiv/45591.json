The use of 3D maps and mobile robots suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) techniques are likely to be employed. The paper also mentions the use of machine learning (cs.AI) and deep learning (cs.LG) for object detection and tracking. Finally, the problem of tracking objects with long-term dynamics suggests that control systems (cs.SY) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
