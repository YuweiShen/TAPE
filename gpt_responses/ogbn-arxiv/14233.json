The specific application mentioned in the title and abstract is ontological reasoning, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of the \\textsc{dlv} system, which is a deductive database system, placing it in the category of databases (cs.DB). The use of negation and aggregations in the rewritten program suggests that the paper may also be relevant to logic (cs.LO) and description logic (cs.DL). Finally, the paper discusses the optimization of the rewritten program, which involves the elimination of subsumed rules and efficient handling of binding propagation, which are techniques commonly used in program analysis and optimization, placing it in the category of programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
