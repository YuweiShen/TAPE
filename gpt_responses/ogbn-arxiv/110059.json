The proposed method involves dividing each frame into small non-overlapping blocks of equal sizes, which is a common technique in computer vision. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with compressive video sensing, which is a multimedia-related problem. The proposed method involves reconstructing key frames using adaptively learned sparsifying basis via $\\ell_0$ minimization, which is a common technique in multimedia signal processing. \n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper involves compressive sensing, which is a subfield of information theory. The proposed method involves exploiting the spatial and temporal redundancies of a video sequence, which is a common technique in compressive sensing. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves dictionary learning, which is a common technique in machine learning. The effectiveness of three well-known dictionary learning algorithms is investigated in the proposed method. \n5. cs.MM (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper involves compressive video sensing, which is a common problem in human-computer interaction. The proposed method involves using peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) index as the quality assessor, which are common techniques in human-computer interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
