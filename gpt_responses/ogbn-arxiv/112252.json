The model is designed to work in a never-ending process of \"guess-and-check\", where neurons predict the activity values of one another and then immediately adjust their own activities to make better future predictions. The model is situated within the framework of spiking neural networks and is experimentally evaluated in pattern recognition tasks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). \n\nHowever, the paper also discusses the potential of the proposed model for online semi-supervised learning and its computational efficiency and biological plausibility, which are relevant to other sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Therefore, the next likely sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
