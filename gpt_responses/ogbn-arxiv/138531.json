This involves the use of self-interference suppression (SIS) techniques, which are commonly studied in the fields of information theory (cs.IT) and networking (cs.NI). The paper also focuses on cognitive radio systems (cs.CR) and explores the spectrum awareness/efficiency tradeoff, which is a key aspect of these systems. Additionally, the paper proposes an adaptive strategy for the secondary user link, which involves threshold-based decision making and can be seen as a control system (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the performance metrics for the proposed modes of operation, which involves analyzing the throughput and outage probabilities, and can be seen as a communication theory problem (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
