The paper provides a tight sample complexity bound for learning the Mallows Block Model, which is a generalization of the Mallows and Generalized Mallows models. This makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) the most likely category. The paper also involves combinatorial and statistical analysis, which suggests cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.ST (Statistics) as likely categories. The paper deals with modeling and estimation of ranking data, which is a common problem in Artificial Intelligence, suggesting cs.AI as a likely category. Finally, the paper involves information theory, which suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
