It also uses a limited amount of supervision from task-specific scores on a subset of the vocabulary. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories due to the use of neural networks and the development of a new architecture. The paper may also be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories due to the use of vector space models and neural networks for modeling lexical entailment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
