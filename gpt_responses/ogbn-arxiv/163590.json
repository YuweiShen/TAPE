This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the ability to tune the algorithm for desired reconstruction quality and runtime performance, which suggests that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
