The paper focuses on the non-asymptotic convergence analysis of TDC under a non-i.i.d. Markovian sample path and linear function approximation. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), control systems (cs.SY), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
