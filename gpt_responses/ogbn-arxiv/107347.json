The use of convex hull based features for character recognition is a common technique in computer vision, making this category the most likely fit for this paper. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses an MLP based classifier for recognition, which falls under the category of machine learning. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of machine learning techniques for character recognition can also be classified under the broader category of artificial intelligence. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): While not directly related to information retrieval, the paper deals with the extraction of features from handwritten characters, which can be seen as a form of information retrieval. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The use of an MLP based classifier falls under the category of neural computing, making this category a possible fit for the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
