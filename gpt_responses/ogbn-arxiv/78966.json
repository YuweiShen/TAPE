This involves algorithmic and data structure design, making it likely to fall under cs.DS. The paper also discusses the practical use-cases of the proposed solution, indicating relevance to cs.DB. The solution involves machine learning techniques for predicting edge weights, indicating relevance to cs.AI. The paper also discusses the query performance and preprocessing times, indicating relevance to cs.LG.
