The paper also provides sound and computationally adequate categorical models for the type system, which is a common approach in logic-based research. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper proposes a new type system that supports type-level recursion and term-level recursion, which are important features in programming languages. The paper also discusses the convenience and safety properties of the type system, which are important concerns in programming language design. \n- cs.TL (Type Theory): The paper introduces a new type system that supports mixed linear and non-linear recursive types, which is a topic of interest in type theory. The paper also discusses the categorical models for the type system, which is a common approach in type theory research. \n- cs.LG (Learning): Although the paper is not directly related to machine learning, the use of linear types has been explored in the context of deep learning and neural networks, which falls under the category of learning. The paper's discussion of linear and non-linear typing may be relevant to this area of research. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper's discussion of the safety properties and convenience of the type system may be relevant to software engineering, as these are"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
