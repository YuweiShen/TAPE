The paper also involves hardware implementation, which suggests it could also belong to the Architecture (cs.AR) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses energy efficiency, which could place it in the Embedded Systems (cs.ET) sub-category. The paper also involves data structures and algorithms, which could place it in the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with communication systems, which could place it in the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
