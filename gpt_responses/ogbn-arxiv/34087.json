This falls under the domain of information theory. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the design of codes for practical MIMO systems, which involves the control and optimization of the transmission process. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the reduction in PAPR values, which is relevant for wireless networks and internet architecture. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the advantages of the proposed codes for multimedia applications, which require high spectral efficiency and low PAPR values. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the reduction in the number of processor bits for the encoder, which is relevant for computational engineering and science applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
