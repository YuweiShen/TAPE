The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning model to address the weaknesses of previous global models. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which suggests it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with information retrieval, which could place it in cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the use of reinforcement learning implies a focus on optimization, which could suggest cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
