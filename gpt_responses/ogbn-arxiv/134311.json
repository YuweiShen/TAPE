This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): Hyperspectral imaging is used in various applications such as remote sensing and information retrieval. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): Hyperspectral imaging is used in multimedia applications such as image and video processing. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although less likely, hyperspectral imaging can also be used in social and information networks for tasks such as anomaly detection and classification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
