The proposed modifications also involve leveraging context, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper introduces new algorithms for semantic segmentation, which falls under the category of natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
