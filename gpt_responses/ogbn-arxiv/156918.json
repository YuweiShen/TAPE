The proposed model also involves the use of cryptographic proofs for data verification, which relates to computer security (cs.CR). Additionally, the use of Merkle trees, a fundamental component of blockchain technology, suggests a potential connection to distributed computing (cs.DC) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the analysis of performance, communication costs, and information diversity requirements suggests a potential connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
