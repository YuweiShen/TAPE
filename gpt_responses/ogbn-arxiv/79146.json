The use of cooperative jamming and lattice alignment techniques suggests a focus on networked information systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the use of i.i.d. coding and the asymmetric compute-and-forward decoding strategy suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
