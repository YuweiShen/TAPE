The paper also compares the performance of the new approach to a standalone database, which suggests that it could also fall under the Databases (cs.DB) sub-category. The implementation of the new approach involves modifications to the operating system and data structures, which could place it under the Operating Systems (cs.OS) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories.
