The paper focuses on computer vision and natural language processing datasets, which are typically covered by the cs.CV and cs.CL sub-categories. The use of focal loss and temperature scaling to improve calibration is a technique commonly used in the field of deep learning, which falls under the cs.LG sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the factors causing miscalibration, which could be relevant to the cs.AI sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the potential security implications of miscalibration, which could be relevant to the cs.CR sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
