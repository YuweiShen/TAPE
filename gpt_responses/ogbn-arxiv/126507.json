This involves the use of convolutional group-sparse representation of images with total variation (TV) regularization for high-quality multimodal imaging. The paper also develops an online algorithm that enables the unsupervised learning of convolutional dictionaries on large-scale datasets that are typical in such applications. Based on these descriptions, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), followed by cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
