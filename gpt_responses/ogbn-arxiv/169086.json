Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of deep learning models, which suggests that it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. The use of deep learning models for information extraction also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) category. The paper involves the detection of symbols and pipelines, which suggests that it could belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of deep learning models for information extraction, which suggests that it could belong to the deep learning (cs.DL) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
