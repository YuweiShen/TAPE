Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the tradeoffs between high gain of narrow beamwidth antennas and susceptibility to misalignment, which involves information theory and signal processing, making cs.IT (Information Theory) another likely sub-category. The use of mmWave bands and radio access also involves the study of electromagnetic waves and propagation, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the proposed beamwidth-adaptation scheme involves control and robotics, making cs.AR (Robotics) and cs.RO (Control Systems) possible sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
