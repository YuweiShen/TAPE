The paper also mentions the heterogeneous requirements and restrictions of different network technologies, which involves information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of optimization techniques such as Benders decomposition also involves the field of distributed computing (cs.DC) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
