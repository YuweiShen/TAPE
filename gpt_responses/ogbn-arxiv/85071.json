The use of a multi-class convolutional neural network (CNN) also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of image processing techniques and medical imaging data could also suggest the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of prior knowledge of the data and the potential application in supporting radiologists could suggest the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
