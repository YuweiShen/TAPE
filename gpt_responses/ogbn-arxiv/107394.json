This involves evaluating the architecture through the development of a testbed with smart devices, large scale scenarios with the OMNeT++ simulation environment, and feeding the simulation environment with traces of data collected from experiments done using the testbed. This work is likely to fall under the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on developing a system architecture for communications among smart devices in the IoT, which is a networking and internet architecture problem. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses distributed and decentralised communications among smart devices, which is a distributed computing problem. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents a system architecture for enabling applications to perform distributed and decentralised communications among smart devices, which is a systems and control problem. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper may involve the development of algorithms and data structures for enabling distributed and decentralised communications among smart devices. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper may involve the application of information theory concepts to the design and evaluation of the system architecture for communications among smart devices."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
