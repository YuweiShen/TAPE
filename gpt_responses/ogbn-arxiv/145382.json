The paper specifically addresses the issue of earlier stages of the training pipeline becoming a bottleneck as accelerators improve, which is a problem that is particularly relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the use of different algorithms and batch sizes, which are topics that are relevant to data science (cs.DS) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
