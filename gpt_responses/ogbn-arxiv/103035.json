Other likely categories could include cs.LG (machine learning) as the paper proposes a new network architecture and objective function for training a source separation system with weak labels, and cs.SI (sound and music processing) as the paper deals with separating speech and music audio signals. Other possible categories could include cs.CV (computer vision) as the paper uses a sound event classifier to assess the separator's performance, and cs.CL (computation and language) as the paper deals with separating different types of sounds in an audio mixture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
