This makes cs.CR the most likely category.\n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper uses a 3-DoF helicopter as one of the systems to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. This makes cs.RO a likely category.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a system-wide restart-based framework to maintain the system within the safety region. This makes cs.SY a likely category.\n4. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses software components of the proposed approach. This makes cs.SE a possible category.\n5. cs.EMBD (Embedded Systems): The paper deals with safety-critical embedded systems and proposes a security mechanism for them. This makes cs.EMBD a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
