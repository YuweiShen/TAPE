The paper also discusses mathematical and computational approaches to modeling frictional contact, which could fall under the categories of mechanical engineering (cs.ME) or control systems (cs.SY). The paper also presents a new approach to capturing simultaneous frictional impacts, which could be relevant to the field of computational engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the paper discusses the termination of the presented approach, which could be relevant to the field of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
