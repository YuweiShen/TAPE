This involves computer vision (CV) techniques for analyzing video frames, natural language processing (NLP) for processing text descriptions, and machine learning (ML) for training the deep architecture. Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves multimedia (MM) analysis and retrieval, information retrieval (IR) for selecting relevant video segments, computational linguistics (CL) for processing text descriptions, and machine learning (ML) for training the deep architecture.
