The games are used to model social influence and coordination (cs.SI, cs.SOC). The paper also discusses the complexity of transitions between beliefs and opinions, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.DM). Finally, the paper introduces a novel class of games with additional characteristics, which could be relevant to artificial intelligence research (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
