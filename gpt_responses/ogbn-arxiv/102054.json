The paper also introduces granular computing and rough sets, which are topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed algorithms for rule mining involve data structures and optimization techniques commonly used in data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the application of the proposed approach to a real-world dataset, which is a common theme in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
