Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves the use of functional maps, which is a technique commonly used in computer graphics (cs.GR). The paper deals with geometric properties of shapes, which falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also involves matrix computations, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.MM) and linear algebra (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
