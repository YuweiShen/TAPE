This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also proposes a generalized computation graph that subsumes value-based model-free methods and model-based methods, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The navigation model learns from raw images, which involves computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper evaluates the approach on a real-world RC car, which involves systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
