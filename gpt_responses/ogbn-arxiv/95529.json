The proposed approach involves using Gaussian Processes to model the distribution of detection scores, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The paper also involves designing a new covariance function, which is a mathematical technique (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of distinguishing irregular objects from regular objects and other objects, which is a security and privacy issue (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a new dataset, which is an information retrieval problem (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
