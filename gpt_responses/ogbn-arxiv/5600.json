Therefore, cs.SD (Sound) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as speech intelligibility and quality, which could be categorized under cs.CL (Computation and Language). The use of deep neural networks (DNN) for speech separation also suggests the possibility of using techniques from cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SI (Speech and Audio Processing). Finally, the paper's focus on training targets and performance evaluation could also be relevant to cs.SDQ (Sound and Music Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
