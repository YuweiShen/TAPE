Therefore, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also introduces a new residual block architecture and a generally applicable tool for matching prior distributions, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The method involves gating convolutional channels in a fine-grained manner, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE) and the resulting networks learn to use more features for difficult examples and fewer features for simple examples, which is related to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
