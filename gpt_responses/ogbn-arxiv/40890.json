Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves image processing techniques, such as denoising autoencoders, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV). The use of synthetic training data and error estimation techniques also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the use of neural seq2seq models suggests a focus on deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
