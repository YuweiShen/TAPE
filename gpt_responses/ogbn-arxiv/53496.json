It also involves optimization algorithms and convex formulations, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of alternating optimization and successive convex approximation is a common technique in network optimization (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents numerical results, which could fall under the category of machine learning or statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
