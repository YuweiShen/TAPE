The use of cooperation and partial cribbing also involves networked systems and protocols, which could place it in the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of coding and decoding techniques, which could place it in the cs.SI (Systems and Control) sub-category.
