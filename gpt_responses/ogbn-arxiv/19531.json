The use of transmission zeros and connection matrices suggests a focus on networked systems and networked control (cs.NI). The application of the results to steady state estimation accuracy implies a connection to signal processing and information theory (cs.SI). The use of matrices and conditions for equivalence suggests a connection to linear algebra and matrix analysis (cs.MA). Finally, the use of distributed predictors and Kalman filters suggests a connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
