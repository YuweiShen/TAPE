It also touches on numerical analysis (cs.NA) as it studies the smoothness constant with respect to the $\\ell_\\infty$-norm. Computer vision (cs.CV) is another possible sub-category as deep networks are commonly used in image processing tasks. Additionally, the paper's focus on the geometric properties of the objective function suggests it could also be relevant to the data structures (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
