The use of optimization tools such as cross-entropy methods and evolutionary strategies also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The application of these techniques to enable agents to learn efficiently from rewards suggests a focus on robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
