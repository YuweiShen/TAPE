The approach is evaluated on a dataset of synthetic event logs, which relates to software engineering (cs.SE) and security and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also mentions the use of case-level and event-level attributes, which suggests the use of databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
