It also involves modifications to a standard object detector, which could fall under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The use of skip connections and foveal structure suggests a neural network approach, which could also fall under the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category. Finally, the paper involves adapting a pipeline to predict segmentation masks, which could fall under the Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
