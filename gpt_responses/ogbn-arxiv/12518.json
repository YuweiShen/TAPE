This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of deep metric learning and discriminative testing also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the Fashion-MNIST dataset mentioned in the abstract indicates a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
