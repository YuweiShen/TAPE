Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The paper also deals with quantum information (cs.QI), as it discusses the power of quantum Fourier sampling. Additionally, the paper involves the study of polynomials and their properties (cs.DS), as well as information theory (cs.IT) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
