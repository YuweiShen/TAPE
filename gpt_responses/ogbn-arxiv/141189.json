The paper proposes a new decomposition algorithm that jointly optimizes the whole light field data for proper angular coherence, which involves techniques from computer graphics and optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.GR (Computer Graphics). Additionally, the paper uses Retinex theory and works on the gradient domain, which suggests that it may also be relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). Finally, the paper uses optimization techniques, which suggests that it may also be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
