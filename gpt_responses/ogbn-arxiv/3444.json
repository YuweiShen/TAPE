The paper focuses on the use of quadrilateral sliding windows and a shared Monte-Carlo method for accurate computing of polygonal areas. The paper also introduces a sequential protocol for relative regression and an auxiliary smooth Ln loss for further regressing the position of text. Given these methods, it is likely that this paper would be categorized under computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
