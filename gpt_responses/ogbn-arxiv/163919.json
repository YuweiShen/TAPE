Information theory is concerned with the study of communication systems and coding theory, which includes polar codes. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses deep learning techniques to design polar codes. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the design of communication systems, which is a subfield of systems and control. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper's focus on communication systems and coding theory is relevant to networking and internet architecture. \n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper does not explicitly deal with computational complexity, but the use of deep learning techniques may have implications for the computational complexity of polar code design."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
