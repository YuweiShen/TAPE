This is related to information theory. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses techniques to reduce write energy for PCM, which is related to system optimization and control. \n- cs.ET (Embedded Systems): The proposed encoding technique can be implemented on-chip, which is related to embedded systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
