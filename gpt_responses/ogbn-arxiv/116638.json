This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV). The use of a novel equation and a classifier for detecting humans suggests the use of machine learning techniques, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also mentions analyzing discriminative features, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the use of images suggests the use of multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
