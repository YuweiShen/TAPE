This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and computer security (cs.CR) categories. The paper also mentions the use of deep learning technologies, which is a common topic in the multimedia (cs.MM) category. Additionally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of the proposed protocol in real-world scenarios, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
