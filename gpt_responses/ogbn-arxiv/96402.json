The use of resolvable designs involves coding techniques, which is related to Information Theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the partitioning of jobs and the exchange of intermediate values, which are topics in Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The performance analysis and experimental results involve the use of clusters, which is related to Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the use of coded distributed computing schemes involves network coding, which is related to Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
