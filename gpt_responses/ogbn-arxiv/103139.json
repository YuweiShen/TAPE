The use of comb diagrams and the focus on feedback suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of logic in computer science (cs.LO), distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DS), control theory (cs.SY), and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
