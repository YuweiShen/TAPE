Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes a new attention mechanism, which involves tracking dependency parent and child words, and capturing important words that will be decoded in the future. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper uses automatic evaluation metrics such as F1 and ROUGE, which are commonly used in natural language processing research. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
