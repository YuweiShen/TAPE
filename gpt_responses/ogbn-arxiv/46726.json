It also introduces a generalization of the convolutional networks (CNN) paradigm, which is a popular technique in computer vision. The paper also involves optimization and learning, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of geodesic systems and Riemannian manifolds suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the geometry (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the mention of linear and non-linear operators and optimization variables suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
