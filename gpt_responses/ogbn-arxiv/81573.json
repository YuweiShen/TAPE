The paper also involves encoding from one language to another, which could fall under Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). The experimental analysis involves various configurations of solvers, which could fall under Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) or Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
