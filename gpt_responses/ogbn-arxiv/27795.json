The use of cognitive radio and interference avoidance also falls under the category of cognitive radio (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the effects of detection techniques on the system performance, which falls under the category of communication (cs.COMM). Finally, the paper deals with the optimization of the system, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
