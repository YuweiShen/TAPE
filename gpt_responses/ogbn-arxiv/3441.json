Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to adversarial attacks, which falls under the category of computer security, making cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) a likely sub-category as well.
