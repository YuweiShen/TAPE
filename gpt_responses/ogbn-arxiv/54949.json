This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper proposes a novel interference management technique that makes use of both channel state information and data carried in the interfering signal. This involves information processing and transmission, which is a key area of information theory. \n\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the use of interference steering to enable multiple nearby access points to simultaneously transmit data on the same channel to their mobile stations. This involves managing multimedia traffic in wireless networks. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a new interference management technique that modifies the spatial feature of the original interference to make it orthogonal to the intended signal. This involves designing and controlling wireless communication systems. \n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper briefly mentions the issue of acquiring necessary information for interference management in downlink transmission, which could be a security concern. This falls under the domain of cryptography and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
