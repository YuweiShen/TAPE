The problems studied in the paper also involve graphs and networks, which are relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the use of linear programming and approximation algorithms suggests a connection to cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
