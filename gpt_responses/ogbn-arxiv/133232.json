The focus on ease of exception and idiosyncratic manual transformations suggests a human-computer interaction (cs.HCI) perspective. The use of declarative languages and specialized techniques for data repair suggests information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques may be involved.
