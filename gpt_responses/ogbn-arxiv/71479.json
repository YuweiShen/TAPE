The paper proposes a new technique for computing sampling sets for sampling-based robot motion planning, which is relevant to the field of robotics. The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed technique in terms of planning efficiency and solution cost, which are key metrics in robotics. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.RO (Robotics). \n\nThe paper also deals with optimal driftless systems, which are a class of symmetric systems. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of control theory, which is covered by the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. \n\nThe paper proposes an offline optimization technique for computing sampling sets, which involves solving a non-convex optimization problem. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of artificial intelligence, which is covered by the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. \n\nThe paper also discusses the performance of the proposed technique in terms of planning efficiency and solution cost, which are metrics that are often used in machine learning. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of machine learning, which is covered by the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the use of the proposed technique in cluttered environments, which"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
