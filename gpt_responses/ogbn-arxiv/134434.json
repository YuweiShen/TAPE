The proposed evaluation metric, Neuroscore, is based on brain signals and inspired by neuroscience (cs.NE). The paper also proposes a convolutional neural network-based framework for predicting Neuroscore, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper emphasizes the importance of reflecting human perception in the evaluation of GANs, which is related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
