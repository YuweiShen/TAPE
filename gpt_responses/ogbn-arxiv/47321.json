This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) categories. The paper also discusses message splitting and capacity approximation, which are topics in source coding (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper mentions outer bounds, which are related to complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
