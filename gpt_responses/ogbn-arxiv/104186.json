The proposed algorithm involves the evolution of subcontrollers for different portions of the search space, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The algorithm is also designed to work in a distributed manner, which involves coordination and communication between multiple agents, making it relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). The use of evolutionary techniques also falls under the category of machine learning (cs.MA), and the experimentation on real robots involves the use of data and statistical analysis, which falls under the category of machine learning and statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
