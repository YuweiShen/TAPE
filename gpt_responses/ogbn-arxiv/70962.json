The paper also discusses the performance limits and associated costs of achieving covert transmission, which can be considered as a system-level problem and falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the detection error probability, which is a security-related metric and falls under the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category.
