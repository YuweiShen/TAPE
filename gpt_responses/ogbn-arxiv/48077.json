The paper also uses hypergraph theory to model the interference between multiple D2D pairs and cellular UEs, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and graph theory (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper proposes a method to improve system capacity, which can be considered as a problem in game theory (cs.GT) and optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
