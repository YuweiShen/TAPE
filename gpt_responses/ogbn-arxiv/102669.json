This falls under the category of formal methods and automated reasoning, which is typically covered in the cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of strong AI/ATP proof advice, which could also fall under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also discusses the aspect of distributed wiki-style collaboration, which could fall under the cs.SE (Software Engineering) sub-category. The use of HTML rendering and hyperlinks could fall under the cs.PL (Programming Languages) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of formal text and its gradual and mutual refactoring, which could fall under the cs.DL (Digital Libraries) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
