This involves information theory (cs.IT) as well as distributed systems (cs.DS) and networked information systems (cs.NI). The use of erasure coding also suggests a focus on coding theory (cs.IT) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the algorithmic approach to maximizing request rates suggests a focus on optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
