This involves using statistical machine learning approaches to construct a prediction model based on past experience. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a statistical machine learning approach to construct a prediction model for dynamic multiobjective optimization problems.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a population-based evolutionary algorithm to solve dynamic multiobjective optimization problems.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an algorithmic framework that integrates transfer learning and population-based evolutionary algorithms to solve dynamic multiobjective optimization problems.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with optimization problems that involve changing objectives over time, which is a common problem in control systems.\n- cs.OH (Other Computer Science): The paper proposes a novel approach to solve dynamic multiobjective optimization problems, which does not fit neatly into any of the other arXiv CS sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
