The use of deep neural networks also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The mention of video editing and compression could also suggest the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of localization could suggest the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
