The paper focuses on the security aspect of IoT devices, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The system also involves signal processing techniques, which is a subfield of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also involves implementing the system on different commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) wearables and a smartphone, which falls under the category of mobile computing (cs.MA). The system also involves a challenge-response protocol, which is a subfield of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves the propagation characteristics of creeping waves, which is a subfield of physics (cs.PH)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
