This falls under the category of \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE). The paper also involves the use of migration intervals and subpopulation diversity, which are related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve comparing outcomes for benchmark instances, which is related to data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
