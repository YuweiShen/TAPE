Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of analytical tools and ideas from the recent information-theoretic streaming literature, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of error probability decay, which could also place it in the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
