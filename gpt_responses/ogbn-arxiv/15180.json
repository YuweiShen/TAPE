This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of active learning and deep Bayesian networks also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the application of these techniques to computer-assisted surgery implies a connection to robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
