The paper also addresses impairments in the radio-frequency chain, which can be considered as a Signal Processing (cs.SI) problem. The use of multi-branch decision feedback detection and iterative detection and decoding schemes suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.MM) and Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
