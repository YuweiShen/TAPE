Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also discusses software engineering principles, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.SE (Software Engineering). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of RCT in multiple domains, including biophysics, climate science, and particle physics, which could place it in cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.MS (Mathematical Software), or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
