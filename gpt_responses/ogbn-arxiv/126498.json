This involves the use of neural networks to model the shape and appearance of objects separately, which suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of mixture models and probability distributions also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE).
