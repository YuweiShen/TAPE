It also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it is a nature-inspired algorithm that mimics the behavior of molecules. The algorithm can be applied to control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG) problems. Additionally, it involves computational engineering (cs.CE) as it proposes a new optimization algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
