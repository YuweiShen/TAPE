This topic is closely related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, which suggests that cs.LG and cs.AI are likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the impact of graph topology on the over-smoothing issue, which suggests that cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper includes experiments on graph datasets, which suggests that cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
