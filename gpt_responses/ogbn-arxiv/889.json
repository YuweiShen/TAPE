The paper presents a blackbox algorithm for this problem that works for circuits with bounded top fanin, and the algorithm runs in polynomial time regardless of the base field. This problem is closely related to circuit complexity and algebraic complexity, which are subfields of theoretical computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper uses tools from information theory (cs.IT), logic (cs.LO), and scientific computing (cs.SC) to design the algorithm and prove the main result. Hence, these sub-categories are also likely to be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
