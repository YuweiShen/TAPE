The paper also proposes a lightweight global descriptor for neural networks, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The descriptor is designed to reduce computational complexity, which suggests that it may also belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper presents benchmark experiments, which suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
