The use of Fisher kernels and Sequential Bayesian Quadrature suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) applications. Additionally, the mention of cleaning training data and fixing mislabeled examples suggests a potential focus on cybersecurity (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
