This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories such as natural language processing (cs.CL), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and multimedia (cs.MM). However, given that the paper focuses on developing a dialogue system, which involves processing and generating natural language, cs.CL is the most likely sub-category.
