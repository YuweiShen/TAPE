This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with interference alignment (IA) schemes, which are commonly studied in the Signal Processing (cs.SP) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The paper also proposes two schemes that generalize and integrate key features of previous works, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the Computer Engineering (cs.CE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
