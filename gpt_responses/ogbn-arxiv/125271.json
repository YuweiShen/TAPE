The paper also proposes a novel mechanism for extending the lifetime of flash-based SCM, which involves changes to the flash management software (FTL), which is a topic of interest in systems research (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the quantification of data longevity in SCM, which is relevant to database (cs.DB) research. Finally, the paper uses simulation-based analysis to evaluate the proposed mechanism, which is a common approach in distributed computing (cs.DC) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
