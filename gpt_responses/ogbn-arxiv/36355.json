The paper also highlights the need for novel ways of measuring success in AI, which is a topic of interest in the sub-category of cs.AI. The use of utility metrics and the exploration of neglected dimensions of AI progress are also relevant to the sub-categories of cs.LG (machine learning) and cs.CY (cybersecurity). The consideration of human oversight and software resources in the development of AI systems is relevant to the sub-category of cs.HC (human-computer interaction). Finally, the paper's focus on the life cycle of AI systems and the need to set milestones for future progress is relevant to the sub-category of cs.SE (software engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
