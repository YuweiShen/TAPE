The paper proposes unsupervised techniques, which involve optimizing models to minimize discrepancies between frames, and using a pseudo supervised loss term to enforce consistency with pre-trained models. These techniques involve machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) concepts. The paper also mentions the use of evaluation datasets, which suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
