The paper also mentions the use of SRAM/standard cell memory, which is related to electronic devices and circuits (cs.EM). The XNOR neural engine is designed to work in cooperation with the core in the MCU, which involves system-level design and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the XNE in executing state-of-the-art BNN topologies, which is related to neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
