The algorithm uses probabilistic sampling and combines features of both single-query algorithms (such as RRT, which is a common algorithm in robotics) and multiple-query algorithms (such as PRM). This suggests that the paper could also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also mentions planning under differential constraints, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper includes numerical experiments that involve obstacle configurations, which could be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
