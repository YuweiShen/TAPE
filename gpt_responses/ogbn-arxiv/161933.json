The paper also presents a formalised translation process for preserving parallelisation strategies, which involves software engineering (cs.SE) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper includes performance results, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
