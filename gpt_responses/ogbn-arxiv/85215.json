The use of pre-trained convolutional neural nets and deep feature maps suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the effectiveness of similarity measures and proposes a new metric, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of discriminative training and fine-tuning suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with cross-domain image retrieval problems, which could fall under computer graphics (cs.CR) or multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
