The paper also discusses the use of crowdsourcing for obtaining quality ratings, which could be considered a sub-topic of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of correlation analysis, which could be related to information retrieval (cs.IR). The creation of the dataset and the scalability of the approach could also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
