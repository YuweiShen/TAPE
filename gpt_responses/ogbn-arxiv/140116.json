Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves feature selection and classification, which are common topics in sub-categories such as cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the use of artificial neural networks suggests a possible fit with cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
