The paper presents results on the bit complexity of optimal dual solutions to the maximum entropy convex program, which is a fundamental problem in information theory and machine learning. The paper also discusses the stability of max-entropy distributions under perturbation of the marginal vector. These topics are relevant to several subfields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
