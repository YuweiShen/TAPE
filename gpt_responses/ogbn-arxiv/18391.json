This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) domains. The proposed approach is a fully convolutional deep autoencoder that learns to denoise depth maps in a self-supervised manner, which involves exploiting multiple views of the same scene from different points of view. This involves the use of photometric supervision, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and graphics (cs.GR) domains. Finally, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on established 3D reconstruction applications, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) domain."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
