The paper focuses on the evaluation of the Faster R-CNN network for this task, which is a popular deep learning architecture for object detection. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of multi-tiling and Jaccard matrix for merging the different parts of objects detected several times, which involves some level of optimization and algorithmic design. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. \n\nMoreover, the paper deals with the detection and identification of mango cultivars, which involves some level of classification and pattern recognition. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category, which deals with techniques for organizing, searching, and retrieving information from large datasets. \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the limitations and potential improvements of the proposed approach, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category, which deals with the design and optimization of neural networks and other computational models inspired by biological systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
