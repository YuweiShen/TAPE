The approach presented in the paper involves using a generalized classifier to induce pose for novel object categories, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper also involves reasoning over multiple instances of novel categories, which involves robotics and control (cs.RO). Finally, the paper involves qualitative analysis of results, which involves natural language processing and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
