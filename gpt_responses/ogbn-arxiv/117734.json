The paper proposes a new method to improve the abstractive summarization model, which is a popular research topic in NLP. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper uses machine learning techniques to improve the summarization model, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also evaluates the model using rouge scores, which is a common evaluation metric in information retrieval, indicating that it could belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper proposes a new penalty method to address the issue of generating novel words, which could also be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
