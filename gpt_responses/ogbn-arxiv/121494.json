Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel data augmentation method based on mutual information, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of GANs for deblurring images is a popular topic in computer vision and falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with recognizing road markings in unconstrained conditions, which involves robotics and automation (cs.RO) and graphics (cs.GR) to some extent."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
