The paper also discusses the presence of interference, which is a common issue in wireless networks and falls under the networked systems (cs.NI) sub-category. The use of statistical physics methods to derive the ergodic sum-rate suggests that the paper may also belong to the statistical mechanics (cs.SI) sub-category. The focus on large MIMO systems and the use of linear precoding techniques suggest that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) and communication (cs.COM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
