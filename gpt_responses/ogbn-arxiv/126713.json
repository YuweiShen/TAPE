The use of feedback and the optimization of the power-versus-distortion trade-off suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also involves the study of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and source correlation, which are concepts commonly used in communication networks (cs.SI) and networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents optimal schemes and necessary conditions for achieving certain distortion pairs, which may fall under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
