The proposed method is based on the Lyapunov Function Family approach, which is a well-known technique in control theory. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper mentions the huge computational resources required for time-domain simulations-based assessment of transient stability. Therefore, it is possible that the proposed simulation-free framework involves some form of distributed or parallel computing. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper mentions the use of convex optimization problems to obtain a lower bound of the critical clearing time. This suggests that the proposed method involves some numerical analysis techniques. \n- cs.PF (Power and Energy): The paper deals with the problem of transient stability analysis of power systems, which is a classic problem in power and energy systems. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper proposes a novel framework for contingency screening that eliminates the need for fault-on dynamics simulations. This could be considered an emerging technology in the field of power systems analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
