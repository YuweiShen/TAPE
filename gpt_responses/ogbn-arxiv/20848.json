The model is designed to work with multiple views of data, which suggests it could be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV). The use of switch parameters to control the connection between hidden nodes and input views is a novel approach, which could be of interest to researchers in neural networks (cs.NE) and statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
