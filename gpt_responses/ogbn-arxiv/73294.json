This is a key aspect of database research.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the need for scalable and sustainable tools to simplify the data science process, which is a software engineering challenge. The system described in the paper is also implemented as a software prototype.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper mentions the use of automated analysis and monitoring to reduce post-deployment problems, which is a common application of AI techniques.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of data-driven methods in various disciplines, which is a key aspect of machine learning research.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper does not explicitly mention distributed computing, but the need for scalable and sustainable tools suggests that this could be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
