The paper also considers the use of eigenmode power allocation, which is a control theory concept (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper uses simulation results to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
