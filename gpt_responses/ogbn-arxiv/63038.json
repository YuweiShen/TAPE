The use of statistical queries also involves information theory (cs.IT). The problem of mean estimation is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistics, and the paper provides upper and lower bounds on the complexity of this problem, which is a topic in theoretical machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with norms, which are a topic in computational geometry and optimization, falling under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper deals with high-dimensional distributions, which is a topic in statistical inference and falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
