Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning and predicting probabilities, which suggests that it could also fall under cs.AI and cs.LG. Additionally, the paper involves human-computer interaction (HCI) in the form of annotator-agent dialogs, which could place it under cs.HC.
