The paper discusses the perception and decision-making subsystems, which are relevant to these sub-categories. Additionally, the paper presents a detailed description of the autonomy system of a self-driving car developed at a university, which is more likely to be published in cs.RO or cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
