Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a multi-branch deep model, which involves learning local features, interdependencies knowledge, and global features. This suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) categories. Additionally, the paper uses three benchmarks for evaluation, which indicates that it may also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
