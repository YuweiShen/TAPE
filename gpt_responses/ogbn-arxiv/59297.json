It also uses Twitter and Enron email datasets, which are commonly used in natural language processing research. \n\nIt could also belong to the sub-category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) as the paper is motivated by concerns for user privacy and proposes a steganographic system to enable encrypted message exchange without detection by adversaries. \n\nThe paper's use of LSTM neural networks suggests it could also belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). \n\nFinally, the paper's focus on user privacy and security could also place it in the sub-category of Cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
