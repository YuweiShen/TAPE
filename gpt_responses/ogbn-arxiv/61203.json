Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of interoperability and composability in distributed M&S services, which could also place it in the cs.SE (Software Engineering) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of net-centric environments, which could suggest that it belongs to the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of formalism-based, model-driven, and ontology-driven frameworks, which could suggest that it belongs to the cs.DL (Digital Libraries) sub-category.
