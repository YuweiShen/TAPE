The paper also discusses the use of state information exchange between peers, which is a common topic in information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper proposes a distributed protocol for forming a time-division multiple access (TDMA) schedule, which is a problem in distributed computing (cs.DC) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the adaptation of packet length and state space size, which are topics in multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
