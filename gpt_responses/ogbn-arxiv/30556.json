The use of dynamic programming on trees is also mentioned, which falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the performance of the algorithms in practice, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and networking (cs.NI). Finally, the paper explores connections with recent work on LP decoding, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
