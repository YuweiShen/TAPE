This falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the construction of an indeterminate string, which involves combinatorial and algorithmic techniques, falling under discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also involves the use of graph theory and optimization techniques, which could fall under the categories of formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL), information theory (cs.IT), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
