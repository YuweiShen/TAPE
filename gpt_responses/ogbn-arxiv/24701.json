The paper proposes a new training scheme for conditional GAN models, which involves moment reconstruction losses, and aims to improve the diversity of output samples. This is a topic of interest in the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) communities, which are concerned with developing new training methods for GANs and improving their performance. Finally, the paper also discusses experiments on Cityscapes and CelebA datasets, which are commonly used in the graphics (cs.GR) and computer vision (cs.CV) communities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
