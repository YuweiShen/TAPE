Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses various strategies for training large vocabularies, which involves optimization techniques and machine learning algorithms. This makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. Additionally, the paper introduces a new variant of softmax and extends self normalization to be a proper estimator of likelihood, which falls under the category of neural networks and optimization, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed methods on popular benchmarks, which involves experimental analysis and statistical evaluation, making cs.SD (Sound) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
