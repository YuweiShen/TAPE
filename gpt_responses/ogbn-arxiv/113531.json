Additionally, the paper discusses the use of a score function for CNNs, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The study of the dynamics of the score function during training also suggests a connection to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the use of the score function in self-training methods for domain adaptation, which is related to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
