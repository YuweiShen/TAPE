The paper proposes a method for learning to link entities without labeled data, which is a common problem in many domains. This is a problem that falls under the sub-fields of NLP and machine learning, which are covered by several arXiv CS sub-categories. \n\ncs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category, as it covers topics related to NLP, including entity linking. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is also a likely sub-category, as entity linking is a task that is closely related to information retrieval. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another possible sub-category, as it covers topics related to machine learning and NLP. cs.LG (Learning) is also a possible sub-category, as the paper proposes a machine learning method for entity linking. Finally, cs.DB (Databases) is a less likely sub-category, but it could be relevant as the paper deals with linking entities to a knowledge base."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
