The use of a generalized least-squares approach and a weighting matrix also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The evaluation of the technique on X-ray images suggests that it could also belong to the Medical Imaging (cs.MS) category. Finally, the use of landmarks and contour-based segmentation techniques suggests that it could belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
