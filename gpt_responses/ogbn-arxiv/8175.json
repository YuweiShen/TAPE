The use of Finite State Machines (FSM) as a design approach also suggests that the paper may fall under programming languages (cs.PL) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Additionally, the implementation of design patterns may also relate to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
