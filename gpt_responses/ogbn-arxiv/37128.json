The use of multiresolution algorithms and dynamic programming approaches also suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and data structures (cs.DS). The application of the algorithm to coastal maps suggests a possible connection to graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the use of theoretical and experimental evaluations suggests a possible connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
