This involves a specialized pipeline of natural language processing (part-of-speech tagger, named entity recognition, semantic role labeling) to populate an ontology for the domain of criminal investigations. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper describes the use of AI methodologies to build language-dependent NLP modules. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with natural language processing and ontology representation. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of ontologies and thesauri to reason about textual information. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper describes the use of Linked Data to represent and reason about textual information. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves the use of machine learning techniques for natural language processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
