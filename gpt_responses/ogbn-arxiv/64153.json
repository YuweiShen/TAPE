This problem is related to social influence maximization, which falls under the category of social network analysis (cs.SI). The paper also formulates the problem as an approximate submodular maximization problem subject to matroid and knapsack constraints, which involves techniques from discrete optimization (cs.DS) and mathematical programming (cs.MA). The paper's focus on social networks and optimization techniques also suggests that it could fall under the categories of social computing (cs.SOC) and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
