This involves the use of the Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bound (BCRLB) and an estimation theoretic design rule for the Fourier coefficients of the analog transmit signal. These concepts are closely related to information theory.\n2. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper deals with the optimization of the analog transmit waveform for joint delay-Doppler estimation, which involves signal processing techniques such as Fourier analysis and pre-filtering.\n3. cs.SP (Speech Processing): Although the paper does not explicitly deal with speech processing, the concepts of signal processing and estimation theory are relevant to this sub-category.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with wireless delay-Doppler channels, which are relevant to networking and internet architecture.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with signal processing and estimation theory, which are relevant to multimedia applications such as audio and video processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
