It also involves the use of certain channel inputs and outputs, which falls under the category of network information theory (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the special structure of interference in the high SNR deterministic approximation of the Gaussian interference channel, which could be related to signal processing (cs.SI) or multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper mentions direct links between transmitters, which could be related to communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
