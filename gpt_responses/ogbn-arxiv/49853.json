This problem is typically addressed in the computer vision and robotics communities, which are covered by the arXiv categories cs.CV and cs.RO, respectively. The proposed approach relies on intermediate representations that are particularly well-suited for future prediction, and it uses semantics instead of texture information. This suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the machine learning community, which is covered by the arXiv categories cs.LG and cs.AI. Finally, the paper demonstrates an application of the proposed approach in multi-object tracking, which involves data association and could be of interest to the natural language processing community, covered by the arXiv category cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
