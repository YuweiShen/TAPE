This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT), as it aims to maximize the sum capacity of the channel. The proposed design also involves quantization and feedback of channel state information (CSI), which is a common problem in wireless networks and falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). The use of thresholds to select feedback users is a form of signal processing (cs.SI), and the joint beamforming and scheduling algorithms may involve optimization techniques (cs.MM). Finally, the paper presents numerical results and compares the proposed design to existing ones, which is a form of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
