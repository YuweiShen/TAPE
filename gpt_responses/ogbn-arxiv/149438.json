The paper specifically addresses the problem of transferring skills between agents with different morphologies, which involves understanding the control mechanisms that are common between them. This suggests that the paper could also be classified under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper uses MuJoCo environments, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
