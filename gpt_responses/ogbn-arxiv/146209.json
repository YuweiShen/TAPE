The proposed method uses a generative deep neural network to learn a statistical hand model represented by a cross-modal trained latent space. This involves optimizing a variational lower bound of the VAE framework, which is a popular approach in machine learning and deep learning. The paper also discusses the use of semi-supervision and the generative nature of the model. Based on these aspects, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
