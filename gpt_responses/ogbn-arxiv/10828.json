Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes an end-to-end architecture that uses deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of attention models, which could place it in cs.MM (Multimedia). The problem of age estimation from facial expressions could also be relevant to cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as it has applications in areas such as biometrics and surveillance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
