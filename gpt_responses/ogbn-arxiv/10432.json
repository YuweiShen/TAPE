The focus is on the feasibility of active learning, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of machine learning, i.e., cs.LG. The paper also discusses the use of a surrogate measure and a bootstrap approach, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and statistical inference (cs.SI). The context of recovering regulatory network models suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of data science (cs.DS) and computational biology (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
