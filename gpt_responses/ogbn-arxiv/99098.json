The use of reinforcement learning and hierarchical learning also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of model predictive control and dynamics models suggests a focus on control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of sensory noise and different environments suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) for perception and localization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
