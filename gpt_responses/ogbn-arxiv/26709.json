The use of symbolic computation methods and the holonomic ansatz also suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of computer algebra (cs.SC) and symbolic computation (cs.SY). The paper also deals with inequalities, which may suggest that it belongs to the sub-category of computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper deals with determinants, which may suggest that it belongs to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
