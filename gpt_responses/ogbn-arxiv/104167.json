The use of network coding also suggests a possible categorization under networked systems (cs.NI). The graph-theoretic approach used in the paper is also a common tool in computer science, which could place it under data structures (cs.DS) or social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
