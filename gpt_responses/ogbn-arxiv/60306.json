The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suggests that it may also belong to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of similarity maps derived from full-reference image quality assessment methods suggests that it may also belong to information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
