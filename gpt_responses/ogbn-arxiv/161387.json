This involves learning a meta-policy and using it to adapt to new tasks. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper addresses a problem in reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of AI. It proposes a new approach to solve the problem using autonomous inference of subtask dependencies. \n3. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper's approach could be applied to robotics, as it involves learning to adapt to new tasks quickly. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper's approach could also be applied to control systems, as it involves learning to optimize a system's performance given a set of tasks. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper's approach involves developing an intrinsic reward inspired by upper confidence bound (UCB), which is a technique commonly used in natural language processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
