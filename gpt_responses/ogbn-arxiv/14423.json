Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses the size of the committee and network partition, which falls under the categories of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also discusses throughput and latency, which falls under the category of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Finally, the paper discusses the BFT mechanism, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
