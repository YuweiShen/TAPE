This falls under the domain of natural language processing (NLP) and cybersecurity. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also deals with cybersecurity, which makes cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) another likely category. The use of statistical text analysis and machine learning algorithms also suggests that the paper could be categorized under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SD (Software Engineering).
