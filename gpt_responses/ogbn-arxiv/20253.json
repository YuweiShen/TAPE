The use of higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS) also has connections to logic and type theory. \n\n2. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The dissertation focuses on the compilation of functional programs, which is a core topic in programming languages. The use of HOAS is also a technique commonly used in programming language research. \n\n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The dissertation involves the development of a verified compiler, which is a software engineering task. The use of formal methods and verification techniques also has connections to software engineering. \n\n4. cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The use of formal methods and verification techniques has connections to formal languages and automata theory. The dissertation also involves the development of a verified compiler, which can be seen as a type of automaton. \n\n5. cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The use of formal methods and verification techniques is an emerging technology in computer science. The development of verified compilers is also an area of active research in emerging technologies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
