The problem is parameterized by the number of terminal pairs, which is a common feature of parameterized complexity (cs.CC). The problem involves orientations of graphs, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper also applies the technique to the Directed Multicut problem, which is a classic problem in theoretical computer science (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
