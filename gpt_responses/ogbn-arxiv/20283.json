The proposed solution involves a distributed system based on a high performance cluster Cloud, which suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC). The use of dynamic signatures and neural networks for authentication indicates that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper proposes a novel methodology for achieving better performance and cost-effectiveness, which may also make it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
