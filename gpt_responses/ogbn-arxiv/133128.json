The paper also mentions the use of advanced C++ techniques, which could fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) or programming languages (cs.PL). The implementation of routing algorithms could also fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper reports on experiments with real sensor-node hardware, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) if the experiments involved training and testing models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
