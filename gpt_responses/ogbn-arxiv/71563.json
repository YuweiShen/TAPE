It could also belong to Multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with video data. The paper also proposes a method for distillation, which is a common technique in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions improving efficiency, which could be related to Neural Networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
