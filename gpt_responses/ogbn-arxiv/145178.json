The use of spectral and sum-of-squares algorithms suggests a connection to computational complexity theory (cs.CC) and optimization (cs.DS). The mention of \"injective tensor norm\" also suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT). The smooth transition between polynomial-time algorithms and brute-force refutation suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of random instances and threshold phenomena suggests a connection to statistical learning theory (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
