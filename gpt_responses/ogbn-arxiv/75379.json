This approach is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), human-computer interaction (cs.HC), neural networks (cs.NE), and systems and control (cs.SY). However, given the focus on reinforcement learning and the use of intrinsic rewards, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories. The use of physiological measurements also suggests a potential application in human-computer interaction (cs.HC), while the focus on autonomic nervous system responses suggests a potential connection to neural networks (cs.NE) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
