The techniques used in the paper involve Fourier analysis, which is a common tool in information theory (cs.IT) and computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also discusses the learnability of these functions, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with approximation algorithms, which is a topic in theoretical computer science (cs.CC) and specifically in the area of data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
