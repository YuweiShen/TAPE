This involves developing optimum storage schemes and dynamic streaming policies, as well as utilizing femto-caching and device-to-device communications. These topics are all related to network infrastructure, multimedia systems, information theory, and distributed computing, which are all sub-categories of computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), followed by cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
