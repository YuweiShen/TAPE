These techniques are commonly used in software engineering (cs.SE), programming languages (cs.PL), and computer security (cs.CR) research. The paper also mentions the use of state machines, which are relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) research. Finally, the paper discusses the practical applicability of the technique, which could be relevant to logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
