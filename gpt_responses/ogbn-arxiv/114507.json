The proposed framework also involves the use of Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) and teacher-bounded loss design, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Additionally, the paper mentions the evaluation of the proposed method on dynamic scenes, which suggests a potential connection to robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
