The method is based on Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) and Constructive Enhancement OS-ELM (CEOS-ELM) and adds adaptive capability. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
