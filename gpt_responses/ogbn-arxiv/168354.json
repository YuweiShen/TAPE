The proposed algorithm uses local thresholds for word space and line height to detect tables in scanned documents, which requires analyzing the layout and formatting features of the text and non-text objects. This task is related to several sub-fields of computer science, such as document analysis, image processing, pattern recognition, and data mining. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.DL (Machine Learning), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
