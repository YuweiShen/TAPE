The experiments are conducted on image classification datasets such as MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10, indicating the relevance to computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving high classification accuracies, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper analyzes the sparse event-driven computations, which is relevant to the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
