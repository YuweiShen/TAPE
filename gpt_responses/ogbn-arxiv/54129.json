The paper also proposes a global explanatory approach to better understand the non-singular assembly-mode changing motions, which is a common problem in robotics. \n2. cs.ME (Mechanical Engineering): The paper deals with the design and analysis of parallel manipulators, which is a common topic in mechanical engineering. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a global explanatory approach to better understand the non-singular assembly-mode changing motions, which can be seen as a control problem. \n4. cs.ROB (Robotics): Similar to cs.RO, the paper deals with parallel manipulators, which are commonly used in robotics. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a global explanatory approach, which involves analyzing the configuration-space as a surface in a 3-dimensional space. This can be seen as a computational problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
