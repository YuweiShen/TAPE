It also involves feature extraction and classification using a Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) Classifier, which are common techniques used in NLP. It could also be categorized under Information Retrieval (cs.IR) as NERC is a crucial task in information extraction. The use of tf-idf-vectorizer for feature extraction also suggests a possible categorization under Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the focus on Kannada language could also make it relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
