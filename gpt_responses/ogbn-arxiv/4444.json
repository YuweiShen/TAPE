Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely category. The paper proposes a new approach to improve contextual information in convolutional feature maps, which involves pooling regions close to the target. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, which is commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
