The use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and the customization of batch logic and loss function in the model architecture also suggest the relevance of these sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of a large dataset and the comparison of model performance to that of dermatologists, which could potentially fall under the sub-categories of information retrieval (cs.IR) and medical imaging (cs.MS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
