Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a new method for modeling feature activations, which involves statistical distributions, indicating a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of localizing occluders in images, which could also be related to natural language processing (cs.CL) if the occluders are textual in nature."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
