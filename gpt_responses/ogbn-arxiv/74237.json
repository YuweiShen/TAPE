Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a framework for iterative knowledge transfer, which involves training and fine-tuning NMT models, and thus, it could be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper uses corpora for translation tasks, which could be related to cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category, as image captioning and visual translation tasks also involve the use of corpora."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
