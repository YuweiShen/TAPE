The paper also considers the communication capabilities of the nodes, which suggests that it could be relevant to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category. Additionally, the paper proposes schemes for minimizing the worst-case computation load, which could be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category. The paper also involves careful design of file assignment and data shuffling, which suggests that it could be relevant to the Information Theory (cs.IT) category. Finally, the paper proposes a novel converse using proof by contradiction, which could be relevant to the Learning (cs.LG) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
