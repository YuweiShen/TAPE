Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses practical challenges of implementing RTC, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.SE (Software Engineering). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of LLVM-CFI, which is a compiler-based implementation, indicating that it could also belong to cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also discusses the potential impact on system-level security, suggesting that it could belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper uses machine learning techniques to analyze the effectiveness of RTC, indicating that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
