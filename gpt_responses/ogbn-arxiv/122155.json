This falls under the category of computer architecture.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): While the paper does not explicitly discuss distributed or parallel computing, the SoftMC platform could potentially be used in such contexts for memory testing and characterization.\n- cs.ET (Embedded Systems): The SoftMC platform could be used in embedded systems for memory testing and characterization, making this category a possibility.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the programming interface for SoftMC, which is designed to be easy to use and hides low-level details from users. This falls under the category of software engineering.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The SoftMC platform is a system for testing and characterizing DRAM chips, which falls under the category of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
