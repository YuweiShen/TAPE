Additionally, the paper discusses the use of dictionaries, which is related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper deals with the identification and classification of clinical terms, which is related to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
