The focus on algorithmic aspects and implementation using C++ programming language suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) perspective. The use of minimal libraries and achieving comparable precision with less computation suggests a systems and control (cs.SY) perspective."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
