The use of geometric regularization suggests a focus on geometric structures, which is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also mentions the use of residual networks (ResNet), which is a specific architecture commonly used in deep learning for image recognition tasks. This suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of iterative projections suggests a focus on optimization and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
