This involves identifying a feature space that captures the evolution of the problem in the branching tree and the similarity among subproblems of instances from the same MIP models. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Robotics (cs.RO), and Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
