The paper also proposes a novel single-column network architecture for efficient crowd counting, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of data augmentation and density map generation techniques, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category.
