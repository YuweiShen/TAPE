The use of ANN also suggests that the paper may fall under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also uses data from geostationary satellites, which may fall under computer vision (cs.CV) or signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses statistical models to evaluate the performance of the predictions, which may fall under the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
