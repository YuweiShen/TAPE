Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The algorithm also uses space-efficient techniques, which suggests that it could be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The paper also mentions shortest-path maps and partitioning the polygon, which are related to graph algorithms and computational topology, respectively, so cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.GR (Computer Graphics) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
