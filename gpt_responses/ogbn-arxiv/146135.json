Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the implementation of the algorithm and the benchmarking on test functions, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the proposed algorithm can be applied to control systems, which relates to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
