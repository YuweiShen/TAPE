The approach involves training a target network using subsets of data with high density values, and progressively improving the quality of pseudo-labels generated by the network. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), or multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
