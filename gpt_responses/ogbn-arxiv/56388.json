This problem formulation takes into account the quality-of-service requirements of the users, the imperfect knowledge of the antenna array response (AAR) caused by UAV jittering, and the user location uncertainty. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with optimization of resource allocation for UAV communication systems, which involves information theory concepts such as channel capacity and quality-of-service requirements. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with multiuser UAV communication systems, which involves networking and internet architecture concepts such as beamforming and antenna array response. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with optimization of UAV position and downlink beamformer for power minimization, which involves systems and control concepts such as feedback control and optimization. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with resource allocation for UAV communication systems, which may involve multimedia applications such as video streaming and image transmission. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper employs semidefinite programming relaxation to solve the non-convex optimization problem, which involves machine learning concepts such as convex optimization and relaxation techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
