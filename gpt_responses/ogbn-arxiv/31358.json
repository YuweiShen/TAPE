The use of mutual information as a metric for detecting adversarial examples suggests a focus on information theory (cs.IT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of conditional generation methods suggests a focus on neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
