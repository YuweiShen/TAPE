The authors specifically mention Fourier imaging in various modalities, which suggests that the paper may also fall under computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed changes in the framework and algorithms may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SP). Finally, the numerical results suggest that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
