The paper also mentions the use of Kalman filters, which are commonly used in control systems and robotics, indicating a potential connection to the cs.RO sub-category. The focus on sample-efficiency, non-linear approximation, non-stationarity handling, and uncertainty management suggests a connection to the cs.LG and cs.AI sub-categories. Finally, the use of stochastic MDPs suggests a connection to the cs.SY and cs.NE sub-categories, which deal with systems and control and neural networks, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
