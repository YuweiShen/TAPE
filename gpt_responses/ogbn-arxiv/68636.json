The primary focus is on the performance implications of data layouts and memory access patterns for CNN layers. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), machine learning (cs.LG), and robotics (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
