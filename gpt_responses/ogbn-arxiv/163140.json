The use of Deep Convolution Networks (DCNNs) and the proposed convolution-deconvolution network also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The mention of challenging datasets such as AFW and AFLW indicates that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the use of multi-task learning and the proposed routing function suggests that it could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
