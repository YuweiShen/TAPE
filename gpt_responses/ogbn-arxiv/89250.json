The system uses both point and line features for improved robustness, which involves computer vision (CV) techniques. The proposed loop closing technique involves filtering-based updates, which could be related to machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also presents a new dataset for visual-inertial odometry evaluation, which could be relevant to the systems (SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
