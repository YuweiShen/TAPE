The use of a Riemannian manifold and the conjugate gradient algorithm suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.MM) or signal processing (cs.SI). The problem of interference exploitation is also relevant to the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the optimization aspect of the paper may also place it in the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
