This involves addressing challenges related to updating recommending strategy according to user's real-time feedback and generating a page of items with proper display. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based approach for page-wise recommendations, which involves optimizing a page of items based on real-time feedback from users. This falls under the scope of machine learning. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with the problem of recommending personalized items to users, which is a key problem in information retrieval. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an AI-based approach for page-wise recommendations, which involves generating a set of complementary items and the corresponding strategy to display them in a 2-D page. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper addresses the challenge of generating a page of items with proper display, which is a key aspect of human-computer interaction. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper involves generating a set of complementary items and the corresponding strategy to display them in a 2-D page, which falls under the scope of natural language processing and computational lingu"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
