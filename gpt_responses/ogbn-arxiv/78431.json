This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of autocorrelation to localise replicas of a same packet so as to coherently combine them, which could fall under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the paper addresses the impact of signal misalignment in terms of residual timing offsets and phase shifts, which could be relevant to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the paper assesses the performance of the technique through simulations, which could be related to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
