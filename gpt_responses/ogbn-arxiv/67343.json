Additionally, the paper discusses the relationship between CCG and other mildly context-sensitive grammars, which is a topic of interest in computational linguistics.\n\nThe paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) because it discusses the use of parsing algorithms for CCG, which could potentially involve machine learning techniques. \n\nThe sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) is also a possibility because CCG is a formalism used in natural language understanding, which is a key area of research in AI. \n\nThe paper's focus on parsing algorithms and worst-case time complexity suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). \n\nFinally, the paper's discussion of the relationship between CCG and other grammars may make it relevant to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY), which includes research on formal languages and automata theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
