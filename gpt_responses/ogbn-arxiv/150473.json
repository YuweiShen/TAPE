The use of quasigeodesic loops is a novel approach that involves cutting shortest paths from each vertex to the loop, which is related to the study of shortest paths and distances in graphs (cs.DS). The resulting planar polygon is non-overlapping, which is a property of planar graphs and their embeddings (cs.GR). The method involves making cuts, which can be seen as a form of graph partitioning or decomposition (cs.DM). Finally, the paper presents a general method that can be applied to any convex polyhedron, which is a topic in computational geometry and computational topology (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
