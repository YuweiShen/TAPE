Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely category. The paper proposes a novel objective function for deep embedding, which involves learning a similarity metric adaptive to local sample structure. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), multimedia (cs.MM), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and cryptography and security (cs.CR) as these sub-fields are often related to deep learning and similarity metric learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
