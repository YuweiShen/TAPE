The proposed method also involves weakly supervised learning, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of graph search and filtering potential errors, which are techniques commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method in various applications, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
