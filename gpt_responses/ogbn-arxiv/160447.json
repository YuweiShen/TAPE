This involves numerical analysis (cs.NA) and symbolic computation (cs.SC). The paper also mentions the use of rigorous error bounds, which suggests the possibility of work in computer algebraic geometry (cs.SC) or formal verification (cs.LO). The algorithms are applicable to regular singular connection problems, which suggests the possibility of work in control theory (cs.SY) or dynamical systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
