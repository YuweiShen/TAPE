This suggests that the paper could belong to the following sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of efficient algorithms and data structures for processing large datasets. The paper's focus on workload-driven approximation and compression of data suggests that it could belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of complex systems, including computer systems. The paper's focus on datacenter systems and resource scheduling suggests that it could belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.DB (Databases): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of database systems, which are used to store and manage large datasets. The paper's focus on datacenter telemetry monitoring suggests that it could belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. While the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, it does involve processing large amounts of data in real-time, which could be relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of machine learning algorithms.
