The use of reconfigurable antennas is also a key aspect of the paper, which falls under the category of networked and wireless systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses beamforming and nulling matrices, which are common techniques in signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper deals with MIMO systems, which is a topic in multimedia systems (cs.MM) and communication networks (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
