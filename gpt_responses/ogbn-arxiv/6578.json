The use of event-based control is also a common topic in robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG), which could be relevant to this paper. Additionally, the paper discusses the design of ultimate bounds, which is a topic in control engineering (cs.CE) and can also be related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for autonomous systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
