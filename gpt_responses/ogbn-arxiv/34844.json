The paper also discusses reducing the precision of activations and model parameters to improve execution efficiency, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions increasing the number of filter maps in a layer, which is related to neural network architecture design and optimization, and could be classified under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses reducing memory footprint and computational energy, which could be classified under the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
