Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel methodology for boosting recognition by learning canonical forms of glyphs, which involves deep learning techniques. Hence, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also deals with feature learning and generative tasks, which are relevant to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
