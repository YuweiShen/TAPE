The paper presents a general reduction technique for computing equilibria of zero-sum games, which can be applied to a variety of games, including Colonel Blotto, General Lotto, and dueling games. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): This sub-category covers research on the intersection of computer science and game theory, including algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, social choice theory, and computational aspects of game theory. The paper clearly falls under this sub-category as it deals with the computation of Nash equilibria in games. \n- cs.DS (Computer Science and Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category covers research on the design and analysis of data structures and algorithms, including complexity theory, optimization, and combinatorial algorithms. The paper involves the design of a reduction technique for computing equilibria, which can be seen as an algorithmic approach to game theory. \n- cs.AI (Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers research on the design and analysis of intelligent agents and systems, including machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and game playing. The paper involves the analysis of strategic behavior in games,"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
