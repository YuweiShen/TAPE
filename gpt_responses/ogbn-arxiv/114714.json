Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves optimization and complexity analysis, which are common in machine learning and data science, making cs.LG and cs.DS likely sub-categories as well. The paper also discusses software engineering aspects of metareasoning, such as designing and implementing metareasoning systems, which makes cs.SE a possible sub-category.
