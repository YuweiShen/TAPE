This involves modeling the learning of context parameter and classifier in a unified objective and optimizing it with an alternative strategy in an iterative algorithm. This work is related to machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
