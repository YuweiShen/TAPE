The proposed approach uses self-supervised learning, which is a popular topic in machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, the paper introduces novel techniques for processing 360\u00b0 images, which could fall under computer graphics (GR). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.RO, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.GR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
