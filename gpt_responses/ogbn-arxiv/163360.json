The proposed solution involves reducing the training time by reducing data access time through systematic and cyclic/sequential sampling. This suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
