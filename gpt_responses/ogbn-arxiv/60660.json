Therefore, the most likely category is cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also proposes an alternate representation of polynomial NARMAX models, which involves polynomial functions and approximation methods, indicating a possible fit with categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with parameterized approximation methods, which could be related to categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
