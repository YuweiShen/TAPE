The proposed method uses a Generative Grasping Convolutional Neural Network (GG-CNN) to predict the quality and pose of grasps at every pixel, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The GG-CNN is also designed to be lightweight and efficient, which relates to machine learning (cs.LG) and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
