The use of neural networks also suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions the use of beam-search decoding, which is commonly used in natural language processing, further supporting the likelihood of it belonging to cs.CL. Additionally, the paper mentions the practical advantages of extending NMT to very large input and output vocabularies, which could suggest a connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.CV (Computer Vision) where large vocabularies are also common."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
