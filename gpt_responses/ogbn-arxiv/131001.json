This is a problem in information theory (cs.IT) and also involves multiple access (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of sparsity detection algorithms such as lasso and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) suggests a connection to compressed sensing (cs.NI). Finally, the paper also discusses the roles of power control and multiuser detection, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
