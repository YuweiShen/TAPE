The use of autoencoders for probabilistic shaping involves machine learning techniques, which suggests that the paper could also be classified under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also discusses communication channels, which falls under the Communications (cs.COMM) sub-category. The joint optimization of geometric and probabilistic shaping involves system design, which could be classified under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the optimization of discrete distributions, which could be classified under the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
