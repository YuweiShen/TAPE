Additionally, the paper explores different extensions of the idea of updating many goals in RL, which is a common topic in the Machine Learning community. \n\nThe paper also involves visual-observation domains, which suggests that it could belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) category. \n\nThe paper's focus on pre-training a network to learn faster and better on a single main task of interest suggests that it could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. \n\nThe exploration of auxiliary task updates in training a network to learn faster and better on a single main task of interest suggests that it could belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) or Systems and Control (cs.SY) categories, as these fields often involve training agents to perform tasks in real-world environments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
