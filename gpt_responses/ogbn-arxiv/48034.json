Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of different features and models for building appearance descriptors, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, since the paper deals with video surveillance, it could also be classified under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
