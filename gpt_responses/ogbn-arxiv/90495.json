This is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG), and the proposed method involves modelling interdependencies between channels (cs.NE) and improving the representational power of CNNs (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the potential for natural language processing applications (cs.CL) in the future."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
