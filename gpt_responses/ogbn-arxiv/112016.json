The paper also proposes a synthesis process that leverages constraints such as functional dependency, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of co-occurrence statistics to identify compatible tables, which is a technique used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
