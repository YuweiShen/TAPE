The paper also introduces a novel algorithm based on existing state-of-the-art algorithms, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, which is a common practice in the field of machine learning (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
