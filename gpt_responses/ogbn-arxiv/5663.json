The use of linear matrix inequalities and the analysis of the complexity of the algorithm suggest that the paper belongs to the systems and control (cs.SY) and numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-categories. The use of symbolic homotopy and the focus on exact algorithms suggest that the paper may also belong to the computer algebra (cs.SC) and complexity theory (cs.CC) sub-categories. Finally, the use of matrices and the analysis of the feasible set suggest that the paper may also belong to the dynamical systems (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
