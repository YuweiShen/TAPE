The paper also discusses the use of codes to ensure security and confidentiality of data stored in WOM, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The paper proposes a new method for constructing WOM codes, which involves the use of synchronous codes, and this method is related to coding theory (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of nonbinary codes, which is a topic related to signal processing and communications (cs.SI). Finally, the paper proposes a new construction of synchronous WOM codes, which is related to network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
