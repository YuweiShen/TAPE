This involves utilizing a hybrid objective function that adapts during optimization, allowing the algorithm to trade off reward v.s. exploration at different stages of learning. The paper also introduces a principled mechanism to terminate sample collection once a rich enough trajectory batch is obtained to improve the model. Given these characteristics, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses a machine learning framework for model-based reinforcement learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new approach to improve the world model in reinforcement learning, which falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper evaluates the proposed method on a variety of continuous control tasks, which are often relevant to robotics applications. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses a control problem in the context of reinforcement learning, which falls under the systems and control subfield. \n- cs.DL (Deep Learning): The paper utilizes a deep neural network to learn the world model, which falls under the deep learning subfield."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
