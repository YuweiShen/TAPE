It specifically focuses on detecting spatially compact events in text streams. The paper proposes a novel method called Semantic Scan that integrates contrastive topic modeling with online document assignment and principled likelihood ratio-based spatial scanning. This method is evaluated on two real-world tasks related to disease surveillance and emerging business trend detection. Based on the content of the paper, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Other possible sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.SD (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
