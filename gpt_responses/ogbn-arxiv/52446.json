It also involves natural language processing (NLP) as it aims to generate captions for videos, which suggests that it could also belong to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. The use of a mixture of experts model and external text corpus for topic embeddings suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the use of videos as input data suggests that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
