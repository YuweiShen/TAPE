This involves the use of signal processing techniques and wireless communication technologies, which are relevant to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper involves the measurement and analysis of channel characteristics such as path-loss, shadowing, and delay spread, which are important parameters in wireless communication systems. Information theory is concerned with the fundamental limits of communication systems and the efficient use of communication resources, which are relevant to the design and optimization of wireless networks. \n\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper presents results from a measurement campaign in a microcell environment, which is a typical scenario for wireless networks. The use of phased antenna arrays and beam steering techniques is also relevant to the design of directional antennas and beamforming algorithms for wireless networks. \n\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper involves the measurement and analysis of power angular spectrum and multi-path components, which are important parameters for the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a wireless communication system. Multimedia applications such as video streaming and online gaming require high data rates and low latency, which are affected by the channel characteristics and the presence of multi-path components. \n\n- cs.S"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
