The experiments conducted in the paper involve deep convolutional neural nets (cs.CV) and the datasets used are CIFAR10 and ILSVRC2012, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. The paper also discusses the use of recurrent neural networks (cs.AI) in generating the damping and precondition matrix for the Hessian-Free approach. Finally, the paper mentions the use of natural language processing techniques (cs.CL) in the form of text-based datasets for meta-training the MLHF optimizer."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
