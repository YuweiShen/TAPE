The paper also discusses the flexibility of the proposed design to deal with multiple numerical formats, which could be relevant to the category of computer architecture and embedded systems. The experimental results for low-precision training of a language translation model could be relevant to the category of natural language processing. Overall, the most likely categories are cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.ET (Embedded Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
