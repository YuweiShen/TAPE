This involves developing a path travel time model that couples a Markov model along with a Gaussian Markov random field, and scalable inference algorithms for obtaining path travel time distributions from the composite MM-GMRF model. This work involves machine learning (ML) techniques, such as Markov models and Gaussian Markov random fields, and information theory (IT) concepts, such as time correlations between neighboring streets. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
