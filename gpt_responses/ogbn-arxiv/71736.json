The use of ConvNets also suggests the paper may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the generation of depth motion maps, which relates to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the rotation of depth data to handle view variant cases may be relevant to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
