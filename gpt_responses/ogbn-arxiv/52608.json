The use of deep convolutional features and region proposals suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of machine learning techniques such as whole-object and part detectors, and geometric constraints, suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of pose-normalized representations suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep convolutional features and region proposals for object detection suggests that the paper may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
