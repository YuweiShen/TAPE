This task involves image processing and natural language processing, which are common themes in several sub-categories of computer science. However, given that the paper focuses on scientific documents, it is likely that it belongs to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Additionally, the use of deep neural networks for figure extraction suggests that the paper could also belong to the Deep Learning (cs.DL) sub-category. The paper also involves image processing, which is a key theme in Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. Finally, the use of large datasets and data-driven methods suggests that the paper could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
