The paper discusses the use of intermediate representations to improve generalization, which is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of synthetic CAD renderings, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The probabilistic framework used in the paper is related to neural networks (cs.NE), and the paper also discusses keypoint localization, which is a topic in graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
