The paper also discusses encoding and decoding complexity, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The concept of channel polarization and the construction of polar codes may also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI). The use of independent copies of a given channel to synthesize a set of polarized channels may involve the study of random processes and probability theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper's focus on achieving high performance with low complexity may also be relevant to networked systems and communication protocols (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
