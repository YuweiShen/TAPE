Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes new strategies for achieving Zero-Shot VQA, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. The paper also uses semantic embeddings and test-time retrieval, which are techniques commonly used in natural language processing, making cs.CL (Computation and Language) a likely sub-category. The paper also evaluates several strategies, which involves statistical analysis and experimentation, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new evaluation protocol, which involves information retrieval, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
