Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the Fourier transform on locally compact abelian groups, which is a topic in cs.SP (Signal Processing). Additionally, the paper discusses eigenvalues and approximation of signals, which are topics in cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory), respectively. Finally, the paper discusses applications of the results in channel capacity, which is a topic in cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
