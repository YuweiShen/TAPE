It also involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. The use of a deep learning model and multi-task learning approach indicates that it could also be classified under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
