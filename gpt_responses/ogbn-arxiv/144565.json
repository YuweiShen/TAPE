Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves working with 4D data, which suggests that it could belong to cs.GR (Graphics) or cs.CG (Computational Geometry). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of Retinex theory, which is a technique commonly used in image processing and computer graphics, indicating that it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
