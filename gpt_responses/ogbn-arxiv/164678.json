The paper proposes joint designs of beamforming and remote radio head (RRH)-user association to maximize the system energy efficiency, subject to constraints on users\u2019 quality-of-service, limited capacity of fronthaul links and transmit power. The paper also considers the problem of RRH-user association to select a subset of users that can be served by each RRH. The paper proposes a mixed binary integer program which is difficult to solve and derives a globally optimal solution for the considered problem by customizing a discrete branch-reduce-and-bound approach. The paper also proposes two suboptimal solutions able to achieve the near optimal performance but with much reduced complexity by transforming the design problem into continuous (but inherently nonconvex) programs by two approaches: penalty and $\\ell _{0}$-approximation methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
