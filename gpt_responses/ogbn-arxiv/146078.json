The paper also discusses the use of complex algorithms for tracking channel variations and adjusting resources, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper proposes a beamforming scheme for the millimeter wave interface, which falls under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR). The paper also discusses experimentation in indoor and outdoor settings, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM).
