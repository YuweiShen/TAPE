This involves leveraging the descriptive captions often accompanying news images to learn semantically meaningful image patch patterns. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a new multimodal pattern mining approach that involves mining words from the associated image captions for each pattern, which suggests that the paper could also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. The paper also deals with evaluating the discovered patterns based on their semantic meaning, which could place it in the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a novel evaluation framework, which could suggest that it belongs to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
