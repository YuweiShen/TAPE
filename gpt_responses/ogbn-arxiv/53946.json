The most relevant sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), which deals with formal methods for reasoning about programs and systems. The paper also mentions the use of polynomial optimization, which falls under cs.PL (Discrete Mathematics), and the implementation of the technique in an open-source tool, which relates to cs.SE (Software Engineering). Additionally, the paper discusses the handling of non-deterministic assignments, which is a topic in cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory), and the use of linear transformations, which is a topic in cs.SC (Symbolic Computation)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
