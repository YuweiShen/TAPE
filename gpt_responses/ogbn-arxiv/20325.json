The paper also proposes a novel approach for annotating large quantities of facial images, which involves deep learning techniques (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The dataset created by the authors can also be considered as multimedia (cs.MM) data. Finally, the paper also mentions the use of a reference database and comparisons between images, which can be related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
