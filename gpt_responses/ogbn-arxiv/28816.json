This problem involves learning the parameters of the model and maximizing cumulative reward, which is a common problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The paper also focuses on exploiting the linear utility function of the model, which is a topic in machine learning and data science. The algorithm proposed in the paper involves combinatorial optimization, which is a topic in theoretical computer science and game theory.
