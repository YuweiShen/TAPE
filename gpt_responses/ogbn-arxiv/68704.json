The paper also discusses policy search, which is a common approach in reinforcement learning (cs.AI). The experiments involve dynamical systems and quadrotor control, which are topics in robotics (cs.RO) and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper introduces a new algorithm that improves upon existing methods, which is a topic in optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
