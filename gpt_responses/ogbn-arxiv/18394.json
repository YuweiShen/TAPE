This involves addressing issues related to variant poses and expressions, adjusting the shade of makeup, and specifying the part of transfer. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category, which deals with image and video processing, analysis, and understanding. Additionally, the proposed method involves distilling makeup style, morphing makeup, and performing makeup transfer, which are related to Machine Learning (cs.MM), Learning (cs.LG), Graphics (cs.GR), and Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
