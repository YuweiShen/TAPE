Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.SY (Systems and Control) are likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper focuses on massive MIMO, which is a subfield of wireless communication and falls under cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.COM (Computer Communications and Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
