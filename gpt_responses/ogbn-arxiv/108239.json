The algorithms proposed involve optimization of objective values, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with occluded views, which suggests the involvement of computer vision (cs.CV). The algorithms proposed are shown to be complete and run in polynomial time, which suggests the involvement of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes methods to reduce the total running time, which suggests the involvement of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
