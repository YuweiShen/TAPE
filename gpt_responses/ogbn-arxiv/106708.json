The focus on normalization for field differences suggests that cs.DL (Digital Libraries) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are likely sub-categories. The referencing behavior of citing publications or journals is also relevant to cs.CY (Computational Biology and Bioinformatics) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the analysis of the traditional classification-system-based normalization approach may be relevant to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
