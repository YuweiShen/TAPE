It focuses on learning to prune the search space of the optimization problem instances, which is a common approach in combinatorial optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), which deals with machine learning and optimization. The paper also deals with combinatorial optimization problems, which suggests that it could belong to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The use of interpretable learning models based on intuitive features suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
