This requires efficient data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although the paper does not explicitly deal with social or information networks, power systems can be considered as a type of network, and the proposed approach can be applied to analyze and optimize such networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
