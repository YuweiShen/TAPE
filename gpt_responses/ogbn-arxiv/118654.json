The paper also discusses landmark reprojection on rolling shutter cameras, which is a common problem in computer vision.\n2. cs.RO (Robotics) - The paper discusses the formulation with a $\\mathcal{C}^2$-continuous spline for the trajectory, which naturally incorporates inertial measurements. This is a common problem in robotics, where inertial measurements are often used for localization and mapping.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper discusses the behaviour of split interpolation on $\\mathbb{SO}(3)$ and on $\\mathbb{R}^3$, and a joint interpolation on $\\mathbb{SE}(3)$. This involves the use of interpolation techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the formulation with a $\\mathcal{C}^2$-continuous spline for the trajectory, which naturally incorporates inertial measurements.
