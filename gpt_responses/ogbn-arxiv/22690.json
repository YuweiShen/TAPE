The presence of spatial fading correlation at both the transmitter and the receiver also suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of networking and communication (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of higher-order statistics (HOS) in the analysis may also indicate a connection to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the comparison with a correlation model based on realistic channel measurements suggests a possible connection to computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
