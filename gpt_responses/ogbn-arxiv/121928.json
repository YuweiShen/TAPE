The use of Zielonka automata and causal memory suggests a focus on distributed computing (cs.DC) and process calculi (cs.PL). The mention of dependency graphs and communication also points towards distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the mention of architectures suggests a connection to control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
