The paper proposes an operational framework of CIoT, which mainly characterizes the interactions among five fundamental cognitive tasks: perception-action cycle, massive data analytics, semantic derivation and knowledge discovery, intelligent decision-making, and on-demand service provisioning. These tasks involve various techniques such as machine learning, natural language processing, and data mining, which are commonly associated with the sub-categories of cs.AI, cs.NI, and cs.LG. The paper also discusses the design of proper performance metrics on evaluating the enabling techniques, which is related to the sub-category of cs.SY. Finally, the paper presents research challenges and open issues ahead, which is associated with the sub-category of cs.SE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
