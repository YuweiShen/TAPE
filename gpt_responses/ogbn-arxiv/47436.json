This falls under the domain of Information Theory (cs.IT) and Communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) and spatially correlated channels, which are topics related to Systems and Control (cs.SY). The analysis of signal constellations and optimization of error rate performance falls under Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) and Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
