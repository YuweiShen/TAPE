It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as camera pose estimation is a crucial task in robotics. The use of deep neural networks suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the experimental results on the Cambridge Landmark dataset suggest that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
