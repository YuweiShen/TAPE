The paper also mentions quantum objects, quantum groups, and Hecke algebras, which are topics typically studied in the mathematical subfields of quantum algebra and quantum topology. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.QA, which covers quantum algebra and quantum computation. \n\nThe paper also deals with combinatorial formulas and graphical calculus, which are topics typically studied in the computer science subfield of combinatorics. Therefore, cs.CO, which covers combinatorics and discrete mathematics, is also a likely sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper mentions representation theory and symmetric groups, which are topics typically studied in the mathematical subfields of representation theory and algebraic geometry.
