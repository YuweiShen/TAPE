The paper also mentions the use of cryptographic primitives, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The paper's focus on preserving utility while obfuscating data suggests a potential application in machine learning (cs.LG) and data analytics (cs.SI). Finally, the paper's mention of integrating with existing systems like Waze suggests a potential application in human-computer interaction (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
