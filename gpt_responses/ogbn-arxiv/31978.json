The use of heuristics and local learning also suggests a focus on optimization and algorithm design, which could fall under data structures and algorithms (cs.DM) or social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the study of constructing network structures for the whole node set could involve information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
