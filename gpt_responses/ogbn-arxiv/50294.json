Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also focuses on feature compression and transmission, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) applications. Additionally, the paper proposes an end-to-end architecture that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
