The method is applied to vehicles, which suggests a connection to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of neural networks also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a camera as an input sensor, which suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
