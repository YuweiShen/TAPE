Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-category of Computation and Language (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel Phrase Author Interaction Topic-Viewpoint model, which involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The evaluation of the proposed approach is based on the informativeness and relevance of extracted reasons, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. Finally, the paper deals with online debates, which can be considered as a social network (cs.SI) problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
