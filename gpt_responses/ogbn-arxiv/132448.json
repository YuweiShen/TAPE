The use of preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) and preconditioned steepest descent (PSD) methods suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the data structures (DS) subfield. The analysis of the impact of turning off post-smoothing in geometric multigrid may also be of interest to researchers in the machine learning (LG) and social and information networks (SI) subfields, as these techniques are commonly used in these areas."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
