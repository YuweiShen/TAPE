The paper proposes a novel solution for this problem, which involves leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data with different label spaces. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Multi-modal Learning (cs.MM) sub-categories, as these are the most relevant areas for cross-modal hashing. Additionally, the paper involves deep feature learning and optimization, which are common topics in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also involves the use of category attributes, which suggests that it may be relevant to the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
