The algorithm is applied to image classification datasets, which also falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of k-nearest neighbor rule, which is a common technique in neural networks and computational intelligence (cs.NE) and statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
