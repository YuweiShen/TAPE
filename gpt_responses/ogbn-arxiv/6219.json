This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of cs.AI and cs.LG, which deal with artificial intelligence and machine learning. Additionally, the paper involves analyzing the deciding factors of MOBA game results, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.GT, which deals with game theory.
