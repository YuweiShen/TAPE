The paper also addresses the challenge of implementing these methods on limited hardware resources, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper proposes a new approach for low-bit precision quantization, which could be relevant to the sub-category of cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
