Additionally, the paper proposes a Feature Mask Network (FMN) that takes advantage of ResNet high-level features to predict a feature map mask and then imposes it on the low-level features to dynamically re-weight different object parts for a complementary feature representation. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. The paper also mentions multi-task objective optimization, which suggests that it may belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. Finally, the paper deals with challenges such as occlusions and noise, which suggests that it may also belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
