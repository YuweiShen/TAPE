The paper also discusses the use of sparse matrices in the construction of these lattices, which is a topic in the field of compressed sensing (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of iterative probabilistic decoding, which is a technique commonly used in the field of distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the use of outage error and its impact on decoding runtime, which is a topic in the field of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
