This suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. The paper also discusses how the proposed theory relates to information-theoretic objectives of behavior, such as predictive information and the free energy principle, which suggests a potential connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the paper mentions tasks such as navigation and reward gathering, which suggests a potential connection to computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
