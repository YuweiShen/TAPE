The paper proposes a novel deep learning pipeline that explicitly estimates and leverages the geometry of the underlying human body. The paper also mentions the use of 3D sensors for capturing real data. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by graphics (cs.GR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) techniques, which are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
