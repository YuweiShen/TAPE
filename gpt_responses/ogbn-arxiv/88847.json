Therefore, cs.NI (Networks and Internet Architecture) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses beamforming and codebooks, which are related to information theory and signal processing, respectively, making cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.MM (Multimedia) likely sub-categories as well. Additionally, the paper discusses communication and networking technologies, which could fall under cs.COMM (Computer Communications and Networks) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
