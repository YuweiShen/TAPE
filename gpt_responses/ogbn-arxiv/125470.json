The paper deals with natural language processing and machine learning techniques for answering multiple-choice questions. The use of self-attention based neural networks and semantic ranking of documents extracted from natural language corpora suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
