It may also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as the algorithm is well-suited for problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients, which is a common issue in neural networks. Additionally, the paper discusses empirical results on image classification tasks, which suggests a potential connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision). The algorithm's ability to handle large amounts of data and parameters also suggests a connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
