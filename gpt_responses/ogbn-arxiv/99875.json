This involves learning abstract representations of influences between agents in a dynamic multi-agent environment. The paper also discusses the use of relation kernels and temporal regularization to improve cooperation. Given these topics, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
