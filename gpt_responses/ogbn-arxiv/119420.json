The proposed loss function is a novel approach to regularization in deep learning, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed method on various benchmarks related to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
