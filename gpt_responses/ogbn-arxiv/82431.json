The use of deep neural networks for artifact removal also suggests the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. The paper also mentions the use of parallel coils, which is related to the multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the paper deals with the issue of computational costs, which is related to the information theory (cs.IT) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
