The use of rectangular matrices and the focus on improving the time complexity of known algorithms suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), cs.CC (computational complexity), cs.CG (computational geometry), cs.NA (numerical analysis), or cs.DM (discrete mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
