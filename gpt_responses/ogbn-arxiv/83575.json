The paper also discusses the use of linear operations and interference cancellation, which are common techniques in signal processing (cs.MM) and networking (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper addresses the problem of transmitting confidential messages over a broadcast MIMO channel, which falls under the category of secure communication (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
