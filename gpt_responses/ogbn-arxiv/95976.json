The paper also mentions puncturing and shortening techniques, which are commonly used in coding theory (cs.CC). The proposed scheme aims to reduce decoding complexity, which is a topic related to signal processing (cs.SI) and network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the paper compares the proposed scheme with other length matching techniques, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
