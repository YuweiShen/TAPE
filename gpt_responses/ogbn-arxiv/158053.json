This involves the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, which are commonly associated with the cs.AI sub-category. The paper also deals with the design of Integrated Circuits (ICs) and System-on-Chip (SoC), which falls under the cs.AR (Architecture) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of developing IP-specific synthesis flows, which is related to the cs.ET (Emerging Technologies) sub-category. The paper also deals with the increasing design complexity, which is related to the cs.DC (Digital Circuits) sub-category. Finally, the paper presents demonstrations of the framework's success in designing logic synthesis flows of large scaled designs, which is related to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
