Specifically, the paper proposes a new algorithm for finding the optimal tiling to partition tensors in order to achieve the best parallelization strategy. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). However, given the focus on deep learning and parallelization, cs.LG is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.DC and cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
