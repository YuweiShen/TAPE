Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper uses pre-trained DNNs as feature extractors, which suggests a possible fit with cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper also mentions data augmentation techniques, which could be relevant to cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
