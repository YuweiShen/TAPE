The proposed method combines oversampling techniques and ensemble boosting to improve the classification accuracy of minority data. This topic is closely related to several sub-categories in computer science, such as machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), cybersecurity (cs.CR), and data structures (cs.DS). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
