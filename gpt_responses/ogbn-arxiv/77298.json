The paper also proposes a defense mechanism, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper discusses the importance of improved training techniques, which is relevant to the subfields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of social and information networks (cs.SI), as adversarial attacks can also occur in networked systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
