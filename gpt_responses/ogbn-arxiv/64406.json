The paper covers various aspects of deep SOD algorithms, including network architecture, level of supervision, learning paradigm, and object/instance level detection, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses SOD evaluation datasets and metrics, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV, followed by cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.MM, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
