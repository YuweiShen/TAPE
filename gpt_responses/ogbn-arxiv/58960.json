The paper also proposes a novel approach to learning shape and appearance models using self-supervision, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of statistical shape models and active appearance models also suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper's focus on end-to-end learning and neural networks suggests a possible connection to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
