The paper also addresses the issue of compressive sensing (cs.IT) and sparse recovery (cs.SP), which are relevant to the topic of whole-image recovery. The use of subproblems and averaging to handle non-overlapping patches suggests a machine learning approach (cs.LG), and the acceleration of computation using a block proximal-gradient method suggests optimization (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
