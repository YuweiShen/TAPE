It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as the proposed model can be used for robotic applications such as human-robot interaction. The use of a convolutional and recurrent network architecture suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper may belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it deals with the estimation of 3D human poses from depth images, which can be used for computer graphics applications such as virtual reality and animation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
