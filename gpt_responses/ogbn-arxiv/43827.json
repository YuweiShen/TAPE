This involves detecting road boundaries that are occluded from the sensor due to traffic. Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV) as it involves image processing and object detection. The paper also deals with robotics (cs.RO) as it involves localisation systems. Additionally, the paper uses deep neural networks (cs.AI) for inference. The paper also deals with machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves training deep neural networks. Finally, the paper deals with cybersecurity (cs.CR) as it involves the security of localisation systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
