The use of Minimum Bandwidth Regenerating (MBR) and Minimum Storage Regenerating (MSR) codes suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Distributed Systems (cs.DS) sub-category. The low field-size requirement of the code constructions may make the paper relevant to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category.
