The use of polynomials in graph expansion and quantum information theory suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the development of new decoupling tools and approximation algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
