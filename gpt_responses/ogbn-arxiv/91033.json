Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The paper also involves the use of qubits and quantum information, making cs.QI (Quantum Physics) a likely category as well. The paper also discusses the use of constant-space verifiers, which falls under the category of cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Additionally, the paper involves the study of languages and their decidability, which falls under the category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
