Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses scheduling, beamforming, and link maintenance, which are related to information theory and signal processing, making cs.IT (Information Theory) a likely category as well. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of millimeter-wave frequencies, which falls under the category of cs.AR (Hardware Architecture). The paper also discusses the use of 60 GHz millimeter-wave band, which falls under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the use of IEEE 802.11ay, which is a communication standard, making cs.COM (Computer Communications and Networks) a likely category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
