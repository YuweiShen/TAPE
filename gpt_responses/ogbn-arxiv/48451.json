The use of deterministic finite automata (DFA) and string distance metrics suggests a focus on algorithms and data structures (cs.AI), while the application of the verification mechanism to recurrent networks falls under the subfield of neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the constraints on perturbation space, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR), and the use of DFAs as a surrogate oracle for ground truth DFA, which is related to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
