Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves signal processing and estimation techniques, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper uses a channel model and evaluates the performance of the proposed methods using trajectories of vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
