The paper also discusses the Global Object Tracker (GoT) model, which is an object-oriented programming model, and the implementation of GoT in a framework called Spacetime, which are relevant to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The paper also mentions version control systems, which are related to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category.
