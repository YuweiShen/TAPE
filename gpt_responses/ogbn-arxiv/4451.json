The paper discusses the development of a new collection for non-factoid answer passage retrieval, which is a subfield of information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP). Therefore, cs.IR and cs.CL are the most likely categories. The paper also discusses the use of deep neural networks, which falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses benchmark results, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
