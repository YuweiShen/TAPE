The paper also involves the study of the structure of CSPs and their support, which is related to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.CG). The use of the Sherali-Adams LP hierarchy and the Lasserre SDP hierarchy suggests a connection to optimization and approximation algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper involves the study of the inapproximability of Max-CSPs, which is related to game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
