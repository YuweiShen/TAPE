The paper also involves signal processing and control theory, which could fall under the categories of signal processing (cs.SD) and systems and control (cs.SY). The proposed method utilizes polynomial curve fitting and could involve machine learning techniques, which could fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
