The most relevant sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), as intersection types are a language for describing properties of lambda calculus and have become a powerful syntactic and semantic tool for analyzing various normalisation properties as well as lambda models. The paper also discusses program analysis, verification, concurrency, and program synthesis, which are relevant to sub-categories cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.TL (Programming Languages and Compilers), cs.SE (Software Engineering), and cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
