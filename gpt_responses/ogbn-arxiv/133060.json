The use of word embeddings to map perceptions in this context can be relevant to this sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a dynamic embedding model that learns attribute-specific word embeddings, which is a machine learning task. The validation of the model on a benchmark dataset also supports its relevance to this sub-category.\n- cs.SD (Sound): The paper analyzes talk radio shows, which are audio recordings, and discusses the use of word embeddings to analyze perceptions in this context. This can be relevant to the sub-category of sound and audio processing.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the use of word embeddings to analyze human biases and stereotypes that perpetuate social inequalities, which is a topic related to the intersection of computers and society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
