The paper also discusses the optimization of a common information set, which is a problem in coding theory (cs.CC). The proposed method involves a novel hierarchical puncturing and information-copy technique, which could be considered as a signal processing approach (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the impact of unknown frozen bits, which is a problem in network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents simulation results to demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed method, which could be considered as a machine learning approach (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
