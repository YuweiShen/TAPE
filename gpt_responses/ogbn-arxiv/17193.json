It may also belong to cs.RO (Robotics) as the focus is on manipulation tasks, and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as reinforcement learning is a subfield of AI. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of computer vision (cs.CV) for perception in the manipulation tasks and the use of curriculum learning (cs.SY) for enabling the learning of complex, sequential tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
