This involves building a structured dictionary for mixed signals and efficiently solving a convex optimization problem that combines standard sparsity with group and collaborative sparsity. The approach is applied to speaker and instrument identification, texture separation, and pitch-independent detection of the number of sources in audio recordings. Given the focus on signal processing and machine learning techniques, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.SI (Sound and Music Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.SD (Sound), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
