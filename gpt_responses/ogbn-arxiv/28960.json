It also involves optimization techniques, which could place it in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the use of pruning and quantization techniques could place it in the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category, while the framework proposed could be considered a data structure (cs.DS) for compressed neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
