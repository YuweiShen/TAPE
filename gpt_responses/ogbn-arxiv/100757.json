The paper proposes a novel technique for data selection to overcome negative transfer in multi-domain speech recognition. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and speech processing. The paper also involves machine learning techniques such as submodular functions and likelihood ratios, which are covered in sub-categories such as cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves optimization techniques, which are covered in sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper involves experiments and evaluations, which are covered in sub-category cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
