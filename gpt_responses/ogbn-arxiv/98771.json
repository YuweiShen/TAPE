Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the impact of the proposed method on the complexity and power consumption of the system, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper specifically focuses on cognitive radio systems, which falls under the category of computer networks and communications (cs.CR). Finally, the paper uses analytical expressions and simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
