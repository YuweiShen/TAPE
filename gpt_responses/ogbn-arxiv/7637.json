The paper proposes a novel framework for combining two individually DRL-trained agents for navigation, which involves evaluating the risk level of the current situation, indicating the use of machine learning techniques such as value function approximation (cs.LG). The paper also mentions simulation and real-world testing, indicating the use of computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY) in the implementation of the proposed framework."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
