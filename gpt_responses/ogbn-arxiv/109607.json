The paper also discusses the functional advantages of equipping robots with an adaptive ToM, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The focus on human-robot interactions suggests a potential overlap with human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper discusses the need for better adaptive ToM features in robots, which could involve systems and control (cs.SY) to improve the robot's ability to perceive and learn from its environment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
