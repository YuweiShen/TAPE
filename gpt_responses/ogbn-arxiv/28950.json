The paper also focuses on the factors that contribute to this ability, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of a symbolic language and the interpretation of instructions falls under natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also involves visual perception and interpretation, which is a topic in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the agent's ability to perceive and interact with its environment, which is a topic in robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
