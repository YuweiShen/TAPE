The paper focuses on encoding longer-term contextual multi-modal information in a predictive coding model. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
