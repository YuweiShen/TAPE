This falls under the category of machine learning and artificial intelligence, which is covered by cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.NE. The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework on image classification tasks, which falls under the computer vision category (cs.CV). Additionally, the framework's ability to adapt algorithms to different task types suggests a potential application in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
