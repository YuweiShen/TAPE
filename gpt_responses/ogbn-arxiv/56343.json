The use of Power Domain Non Orthogonal Multiple Access (PD-NOMA) and heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets) suggests that the paper may also fall under the Networked Systems (cs.NI) sub-category. The presence of eavesdroppers and the need to prevent them from doing Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) suggests that the paper may also fall under the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The evaluation of the proposed scheme for secure massive connectivity in 5G networks suggests that the paper may also fall under the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of optimization algorithms and the study of the optimality gap suggests that the paper may also fall under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
