Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of coded communication to minimize communication overhead, which is relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also deals with the trade-off between storage and communication overhead, which is relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
