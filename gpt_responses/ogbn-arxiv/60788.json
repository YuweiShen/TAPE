The paper also provides solutions to this problem using data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the use of Bloom filters, which are commonly used in information theory, to solve the straggler identification problem. The paper also introduces a new type of Bloom filter, called the invertible Bloom filter.\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper uses Newton's identities for symmetric polynomials to provide a deterministic solution to the straggler identification problem.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the application of the straggler identification problem in determining the set of unacknowledged packets in a high-bandwidth multicast data stream, which is a problem related to systems and control.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper introduces a new type of Bloom filter, called the invertible Bloom filter, which has applications in cryptography and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
