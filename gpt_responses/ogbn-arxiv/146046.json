It also discusses the importance of accounting for ambiguity in designing vision systems, which relates to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper uses crowdsourcing to label images as ambiguous or not, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper proposes a system for efficient crowdsourcing, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
