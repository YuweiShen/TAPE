This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of population-based optimisation algorithms also suggests a connection to neural networks and evolutionary algorithms (cs.NE). The application of the method to image data (as mentioned in the abstract) suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the use of training data and the focus on accuracy suggests a connection to data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
