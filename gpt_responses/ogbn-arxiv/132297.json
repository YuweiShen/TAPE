The paper proposes a comprehensive study on embedding-based retrieval models and pre-training tasks, which are key ingredients for learning strong retrieval models. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval), followed by cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and text processing. The paper also discusses the use of Transformer models, which are a popular deep learning architecture, suggesting that cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves experiments and evaluations, which may fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
