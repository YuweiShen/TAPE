Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces a cross-view training approach and proposes a network architecture, which involves machine learning techniques, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely categories as well. The paper also deals with the problem of fusing features extracted from aerial images at multiple spatial scales, which could fall under the category of cs.GR (Graphics). Finally, the paper proposes a method for geolocalization, which could fall under the category of cs.RO (Robotics and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
