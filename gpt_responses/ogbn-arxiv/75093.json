The use of probability in Banach spaces and Gaussian processes also suggests a connection to probability theory and stochastic processes (cs.PR). However, given the focus on linear mapping and pairwise distances, we believe the first five categories are more likely to be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
