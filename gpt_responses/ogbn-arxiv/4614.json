The use of pre-defined kernels for image processing also relates to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the mention of achieving high accuracy without ensemble or special algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
