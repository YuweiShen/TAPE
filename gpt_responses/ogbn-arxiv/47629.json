The paper proposes a novel loss function for feature extraction, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the challenges of training ReID systems in a single-camera setting, which involves data collection and annotation, and thus can be related to multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with the security and privacy issues of surveillance videos, which can be related to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
