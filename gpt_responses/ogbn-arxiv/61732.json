The paper also proposes algorithms for computing these equilibria, which involves optimization and computational complexity (cs.AI). The algorithms are based on the ellipsoid method, which is a technique in convex optimization (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the hardness of the problem in general multi-player games, which is a topic in computational complexity theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper proposes a practical algorithm for solving the problem, which involves machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
