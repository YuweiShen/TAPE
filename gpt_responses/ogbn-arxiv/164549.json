Additionally, the paper mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Residual Networks (ResNets), Densely Connected Networks (DenseNets), and Convolutional Long Short-term Deep Neural Networks (CLDNNs), all of which are commonly used in the field of neural computing.\n\nThe paper also touches on topics related to information theory (cs.IT), such as the effects of channel imperfections on wireless signal modulation recognition. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of modulation classification, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI).\n\nFinally, the paper mentions the use of GNU radio to generate a dataset for the task of wireless signal modulation recognition, which could fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) due to the use of software-defined radio technology."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
