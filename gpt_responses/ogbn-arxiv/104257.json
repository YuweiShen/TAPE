It may also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category as it proposes a novel architecture for reducing energy consumption and hardware complexity. The System and Control (cs.SY) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper deals with the design and optimization of a hybrid analog-digital processing network. The Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category may also be relevant as the paper deals with enhancing the achievable rate in a communication system. Finally, the Architecture (cs.AR) sub-category may be relevant as the paper proposes a novel architecture for hybrid beamforming."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
