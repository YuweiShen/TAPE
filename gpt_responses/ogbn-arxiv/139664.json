This problem involves mapping of an image and a text description to a common feature space through a CNN image encoder and a RNN language encoder. The paper proposes a new method for learning text-visual embedding using both image titles and click-through data from an image search engine. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories of arXiv CS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
