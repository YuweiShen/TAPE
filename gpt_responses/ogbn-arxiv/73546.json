The use of reinforcement learning to dynamically decide which interaction opportunities to give to the user suggests an artificial intelligence (cs.AI) component. The optimization of both informativeness and exploration capabilities suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) component. The use of attribute-based questions and multimodal feedback suggests an information retrieval (cs.IR) component. Finally, the use of multiple modalities (sketches, attribute feedback, and questions) suggests a multimedia (cs.MM) component."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
