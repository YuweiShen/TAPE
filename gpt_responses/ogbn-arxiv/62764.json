The paper also provides experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses the Kullback-Leibler divergence to measure the complexity of the posterior distribution. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new method for tuning the trade-off between complexity and empirical performance of the posterior distribution. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper derives an alternating procedure for minimizing the bound. \n5. cs.ST (Statistics): The paper proposes a new statistical bound for PAC-Bayesian learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
