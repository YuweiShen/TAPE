The paper also discusses the use of error-correcting codes in these protocols, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper presents constructions that optimize the performance of these protocols, which involves computational complexity (cs.CC) and communication efficiency (cs.CE). Finally, the paper discusses the use of these protocols in systems with noise, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
