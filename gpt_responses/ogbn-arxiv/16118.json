Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper involves theoretical analysis and numerical results, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory). The use of multi-antenna deployment strategies also involves optimization and decision-making, which could fall under cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper mentions the use of antennas, which could also relate to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
