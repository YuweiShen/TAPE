The use of low rank approximation and exploiting sparsity of the input dataset suggests that the paper may also belong to the categories of information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the mention of a streaming setting indicates that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
