This involves using convex graph invariants to tailor the relaxations to the structural properties of the graphs. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves numerical optimization and convex optimization techniques, which could place it in cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) or cs.SI (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
