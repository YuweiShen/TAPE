This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and specifically deals with neural networks (cs.NE) and their applications in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of majorization-minimization algorithms, which are commonly used in optimization problems in machine learning and signal processing, falling under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
