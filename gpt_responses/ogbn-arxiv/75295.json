The focus is on low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, which are a type of error-correcting code used in communication systems, falling under the category of distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper also discusses methods to rigorously control expansions, which is a topic in control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions that the methods apply to more general models, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
