However, based on the abstract, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SP (Signal Processing), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions the use of approximate message passing (AMP) and binary iterative hard thresholding (BIHT), which are commonly used in the sub-categories cs.MM (Mathematical Methods) and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
