This problem is closely related to computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS) as it involves geometric computations and efficient algorithms for processing large datasets. The paper also mentions the use of Voronoi diagrams, which are commonly used in computational geometry. Additionally, the problem of finding non-dominated points can be seen as a multi-objective optimization problem, which is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper mentions the use of weights and distances, which are common concepts in discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
