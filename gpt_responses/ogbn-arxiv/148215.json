This falls under computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also presents an algorithm that maintains a combinatorial structure of the $L_\\infty$ Voronoi diagram of the point set, which involves data structures (cs.DS) and graph theory (cs.GR). Finally, the paper discusses the tight bounds on the number of empty squares, which involves analysis of algorithms (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
