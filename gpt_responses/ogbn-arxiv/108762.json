This topic is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including multimedia (cs.MM), computer vision (cs.CV), information theory (cs.IT), augmented reality (cs.AR), and embedded systems (cs.ET). However, given that the paper focuses on the technical aspects of the approximation algorithm and its implementation on FPGA hardware, cs.MM and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories. The use of matrix factorization and the evaluation of the approximation via PSNR and SSIM also suggest cs.IT and cs.AR as possible sub-categories. Finally, the emphasis on VLSI metrics and hardware implementation makes cs.ET a plausible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
