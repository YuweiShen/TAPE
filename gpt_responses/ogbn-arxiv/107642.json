The paper discusses various aspects of the TTS system, including attention-based speech synthesis networks, waveform synthesis methods, and scaling inference. This makes cs.CL the most likely category for this paper.\n\n2. cs.SD (Sound): This category deals with research related to sound processing, including speech recognition and synthesis. Since this paper is focused on developing a TTS system, it is likely to be relevant to this category.\n\n3. cs.SI (Signal Processing): This category deals with research related to signal processing, including speech processing. Since this paper is focused on developing a TTS system, it is likely to be relevant to this category.\n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): This category deals with research related to systems and control, including speech and audio systems. Since this paper is focused on developing a TTS system, it is likely to be relevant to this category.\n\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): This category deals with research related to machine learning, including deep learning techniques. Since this paper uses deep learning techniques to develop a TTS system, it is likely to be relevant to this category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
