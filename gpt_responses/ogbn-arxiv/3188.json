It also involves training a classifier and a saliency mapping simultaneously, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper may fall under the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category as it involves the analysis of visual data.
