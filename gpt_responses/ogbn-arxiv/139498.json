The paper also discusses the use of non-parametric statistics and memoized variational inference, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions real-robot experimentation and the use of Markov jump linear systems, which are relevant to control theory and systems engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the use of image processing and computer vision techniques to detect anomalies, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
