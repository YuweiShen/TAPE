The use of conditional sampling also suggests a connection to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also mentions an open problem from a workshop on sublinear algorithms, which further supports the relevance to cs.CC (computational complexity) and cs.SI (social and information networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
