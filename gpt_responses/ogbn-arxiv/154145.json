This topic falls under the field of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI), as well as multimedia (cs.MM) and systems and control (cs.SY) due to the use of reconfigurable antennas. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential for MBM in augmented reality (cs.AR) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
