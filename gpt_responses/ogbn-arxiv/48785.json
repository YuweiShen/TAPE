This falls under the domain of computer architecture.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses using FPGAs to accelerate simulations, which is a form of parallel computing. Additionally, the case study involves solving the Euler equations on an unstructured mesh, which is a common problem in distributed computing.\n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): FPGAs are an emerging technology that are increasingly being used for accelerating scientific and engineering applications. The paper describes a framework for efficiently utilizing the computing power of FPGAs for simulating physical phenomena.\n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper describes a case study involving solving the Euler equations on an unstructured mesh using finite volume technique. This falls under the domain of mathematical software.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This is a less likely category, but FPGAs have been used for accelerating neural networks and other machine learning algorithms.
