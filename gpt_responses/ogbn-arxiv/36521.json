Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also presents adaptations of popular algorithms to VAD and measures their effectiveness in diachronic settings, which falls under the scope of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques to create a gold standard for historical word emotions, which is related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the limitations of hand-selecting small sets of seed words, which is related to cs.CY (Computers and Society). Finally, the paper involves the use of deep learning techniques, which is related to cs.DL (Digital Libraries)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
