The paper also discusses the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial examples, which is a topic commonly studied in the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper explores the transferability of adversarial examples to other vision models, which could be relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the security implications of adversarial examples, which could be relevant to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
