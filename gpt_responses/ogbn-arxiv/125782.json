The paper also uses concepts from information theory (cs.IT) and discusses the asymptotic behavior of password guesswork, which can be seen as a problem in computational complexity (cs.DS) and cryptography (cs.CC). Finally, the paper provides insights into the structure of guesswork, which can be relevant to machine learning and data analysis (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
