The use of random seeds is also a common practice in deep learning experiments. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the influence of deviations from statistical test assumptions, which is relevant to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Robotics (cs.RO), and Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to Computer Vision (cs.CV) as deep reinforcement learning is often used in computer vision applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
