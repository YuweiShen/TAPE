The use of probability measures and expected query time suggests that the paper may also be relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.DM). The lower bound on the expected query time may involve graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the mention of a succinct distribution-sensitive point location structure suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
