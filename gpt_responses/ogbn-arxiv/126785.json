This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The paper also proposes a solution that involves shaping outbound traffic, which relates to networking (cs.NI) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The implementation of the solution requires changes to the guest OS and hypervisor, which involves software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper's focus on mitigating side channels in a Cloud environment suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
