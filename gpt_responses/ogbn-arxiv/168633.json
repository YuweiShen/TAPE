This falls under the scope of computational complexity (cs.CC) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG) in its discussion of polynomial approximations. Additionally, the paper touches on discrete mathematics (cs.DM) in its analysis of symmetric functions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
