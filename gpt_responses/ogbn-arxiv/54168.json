The use of auxiliary objectives and self-supervision also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of adversarial training to align distributions suggests that it may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The paper also deals with mapping from real to synthetic data, which suggests that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of hand pose estimation suggests that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
