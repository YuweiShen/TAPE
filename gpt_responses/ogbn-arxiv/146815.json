This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence and optimization, making cs.AI the most likely category. \n2. cs.NE - The paper uses a local optimization procedure called diversified late acceptance search, which is a type of metaheuristic algorithm inspired by natural evolution. This falls under the scope of neural networks and learning, making cs.NE a likely category. \n3. cs.DS - The paper deals with a combinatorial optimization problem, which involves data structures and algorithms. This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms, making cs.DS a likely category. \n4. cs.LG - The paper uses a population-based approach to solve a combinatorial optimization problem, which involves learning from data. This falls under the scope of machine learning, making cs.LG a likely category. \n5. cs.RO - The paper proposes a memetic algorithm to solve a combinatorial optimization problem, which involves robotics and control.
