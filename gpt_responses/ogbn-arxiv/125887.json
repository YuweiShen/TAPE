The proposed method can be seen as a software engineering approach to spreadsheet development.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper mentions the manipulation and transformation of data in Excel spreadsheets, which is related to the database field. The proposed method may involve database techniques such as data validation and error checking.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper may involve programming language concepts such as control flow, data structures, and functions, as the proposed method aims to automate and standardize the sequence of actions in spreadsheet operations.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper may discuss the social and economic implications of using Excel spreadsheets in business and industry, as the cost of human error and inefficiency can be significant. The proposed method may have implications for the design of spreadsheet software and the training of spreadsheet users."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
