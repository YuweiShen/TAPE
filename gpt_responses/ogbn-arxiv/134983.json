The use of stochastic geometry and point processes also suggests a strong connection to probability and statistics (cs.PR). However, given the focus on interference analysis and performance evaluation, we believe that cs.IT, cs.NI, and cs.SI are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.MA and cs.GT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
