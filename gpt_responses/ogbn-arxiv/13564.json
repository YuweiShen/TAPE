This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) as it involves the analysis of medical images. The system is based on deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the importance of interpretability in CAD systems, which is a topic of interest in human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the system produces visual interpretations of the decision-making process, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
