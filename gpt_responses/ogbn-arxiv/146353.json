Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics). \n\nThe paper also proposes a sample-efficient deep RL algorithm based on maximum entropy RL, which falls under the category of machine learning. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely sub-category. \n\nAdditionally, the paper discusses the challenges of applying deep RL to real-world robotic tasks, which involves sensitivity to hyperparameters and poor sample complexity. This suggests that the paper could also fit under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision), which are both related to machine learning and have applications in robotics. \n\nFinally, the paper involves the use of neural network policies to learn walking gaits, which falls under the category of control systems. Therefore, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
