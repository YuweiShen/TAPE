The proposed approach involves reformulating the SCL algorithm to perform intermediate decoding of multiple bits simultaneously, which requires efficient data structures and algorithms (cs.AR, cs.DS). The paper also discusses the implementation of the proposed algorithms on hardware, which falls under the category of embedded systems (cs.ET) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
