This technique involves activating a subset of certain communication building blocks to meet the requirements of 5G. This topic falls under the intersection of several computer science sub-categories, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), communication (cs.COMM), systems and control (cs.SY), and multimedia (cs.MM). However, given the focus on wireless communications and signal processing, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
