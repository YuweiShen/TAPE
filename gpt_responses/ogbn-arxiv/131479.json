It may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as Reinforcement Learning is a subfield of AI. The paper also discusses the use of regularisation, which is a common technique in control systems (cs.SY) and optimization (cs.MA). Finally, the paper's focus on learning multiple policies suggests that it may also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
