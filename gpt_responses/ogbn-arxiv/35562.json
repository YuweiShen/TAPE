This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of supervised learning and optimization techniques for quantifying knee OA severity falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and modeling and simulation (cs.MS) sub-categories. Finally, the use of public datasets and evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of the proposed approaches falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
