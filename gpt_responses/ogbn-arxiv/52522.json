It could also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it involves generating new shapes. The use of deep neural networks and adversarial training suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the focus on learning generic shape transforms suggests that it could also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
