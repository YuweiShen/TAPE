The use of multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver is a common technique in wireless communication, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses achievable schemes based on real and vector space alignment techniques, which are topics in signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
