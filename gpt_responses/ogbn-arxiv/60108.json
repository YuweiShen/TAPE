The problem of finding duplicates in a stream is a classic problem in data structures (cs.DS). The use of mutual information and differential privacy techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper's focus on sampling and encoding subsets of a larger set suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of data mining (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
