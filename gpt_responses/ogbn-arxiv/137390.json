This problem is relevant to several areas of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), and software engineering (cs.SD). The paper's focus on learning from raw behavioral data and leveraging programmatic labeling functions also suggests a strong connection to the fields of data mining and natural language processing, which are often subsumed under the broader category of machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
