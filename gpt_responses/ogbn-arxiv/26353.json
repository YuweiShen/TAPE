This involves security and privacy concerns related to both computer systems (cs.CR) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the development of a protocol suite (cs.SE) and the use of cryptography (cs.CY) to ensure appropriate security. Finally, the implementation of the proposed approach involves the use of modern smartphones (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
