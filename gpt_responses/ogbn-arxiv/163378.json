Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves modeling and optimization techniques, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of mmWave technology and directional antennas could also relate to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
