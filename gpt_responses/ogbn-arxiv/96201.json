The use of vectors and states suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and complexity theory (cs.CC). The mention of \"pseudo-polynomial length\" suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the use of two-dimensional systems suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
