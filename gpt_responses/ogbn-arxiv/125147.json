The paper proposes a new algorithm for heavy-tailed ICA and studies how heavy tails affect different ICA algorithms. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.ST (Statistics). The paper also involves optimization and numerical analysis, which could fall under cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
