Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG - Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves designing a domain-specific search space and optimizing the feature sequence extractor, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI - Artificial Intelligence) and natural language processing (cs.CL - Computation and Language), respectively. Finally, the paper deals with the challenges of recognizing text in complex scenes, which could be considered a sub-topic of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR - Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
