The use of RDF and related technologies is particularly relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and database systems (cs.DB), as well as social and information networks (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper touches on issues related to cybersecurity (cs.CY) in the context of large-scale semantic network models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
