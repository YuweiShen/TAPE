The approach involves using relation variables instead of constraints, which can be seen as a machine learning problem (cs.LG) as it simplifies integration and implementation of QSR algorithms. The paper also mentions QSR algorithms that involve computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO), which are related subfields of AI. Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of QSR algorithms, which can involve natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
