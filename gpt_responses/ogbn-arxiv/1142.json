This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture, making cs.NI the most likely category. \n\n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper discusses the use of SDN in cloud data centers, which involves distributed and parallel computing. Therefore, cs.DC is also a likely category. \n\n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper proposes an approach for implementing application monitoring functionality using SDN, which involves software engineering principles. Hence, cs.SE is another possible category. \n\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the use of message filtering and reformatting techniques for efficient application monitoring, which involves data structures and algorithms. Therefore, cs.DS is also a possible category. \n\n5. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper describes the implementation of the proposed approach within the standard SDN software, namely OVS. This involves programming language concepts, making cs.PL a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
