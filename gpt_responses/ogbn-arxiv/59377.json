Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a method to jointly train on object detection and classification, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also discusses improvements to the YOLO detection method, which could be relevant to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the real-time aspect of the system, which could be related to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
