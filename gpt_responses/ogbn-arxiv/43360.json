The use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) also suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the proposed attention mechanism and regularized cross-entropy loss indicate that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of skeleton data suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the joint training strategy proposed in the paper suggests that it may also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
