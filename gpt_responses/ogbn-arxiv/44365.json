The proposed method involves a learning strategy that involves ranking images based on their difficulty of containing the target object, which is a machine learning approach (cs.LG). The paper also introduces a novel masking regularization strategy, which is a form of regularization in deep learning (cs.AI). The proposed method involves working with convolutional feature maps, which is a common technique in multimedia processing (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves object detection, which is a subfield of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
