The use of RANSAC and minimal solvers also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses polynomial solvers and basis selection, which are relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
