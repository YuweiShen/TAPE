The use of online scaling and torque controllers suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) or Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of robust reachability analysis suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), or Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories, as these fields often use similar techniques for uncertainty analysis and prediction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
