Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves simulations and performance analysis, which could fall under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper discusses the use of shaped APSK in the DVB-S2 standard, which could be relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
