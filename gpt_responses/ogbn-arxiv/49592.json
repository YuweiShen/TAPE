The paper also extensively uses deep learning techniques, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) a likely category as well. The paper deals with information retrieval and analysis of financial data, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another possible category. The paper also deals with automated decision-making, which is a common theme in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper deals with the application of these techniques to finance, which makes cs.CY (Computers and Society) a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
