The paper also mentions the use of analytical means and algorithms, which suggests a focus on information theory (cs.IT) and simulation (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper proposes a flexible approach for deployment, which could fall under the sub-categories of mathematical analysis (cs.MA) and performance analysis (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
