The use of percentile rank scores is also relevant to many sub-fields within computer science. The empirical data sets used in the paper are not specific to any particular sub-field, but rather represent a broad range of publications. Therefore, the paper could potentially fit into several different arXiv CS sub-categories. However, given the focus on citation analysis and evaluation of publications, sub-categories such as cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) are likely candidates. Additionally, the use of empirical data sets and statistical analysis suggests that sub-categories such as cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) could also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
