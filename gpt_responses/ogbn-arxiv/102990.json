Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses hardware constraints and efficient design, which falls under cs.EM (Embedded Systems) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The authors propose a bottom-up DNN design approach, which is related to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
