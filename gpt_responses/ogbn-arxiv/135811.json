This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), or Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. The paper also proposes online learning-based attacking strategies, which could fall under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category.
