This involves learning models to reduce distortion in both I and P/B frames. The paper also proposes a time-constrained quality enhancement optimization scheme. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are Multimedia (cs.MM), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Information Theory (cs.IT), Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), and Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
