The method involves mapping and planning strategies, which may involve computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The path planning algorithm used is CHOMP, which is a popular optimization algorithm in robotics (cs.SY). Finally, the paper also discusses testing the proposed method in simulation and on a physical robot, which may involve machine learning techniques for training and evaluation (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
