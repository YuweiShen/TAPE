The introduction of secrecy constraints makes it relevant to the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of private messages and the consideration of individual secrecy suggest that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the use of cognitive techniques and the consideration of eavesdroppers suggest that the paper may also be relevant to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
