The paper also discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (cs.LG) and proposes a novel method for synthesizing facial appearance variations (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper evaluates its approach on benchmark datasets (cs.MM) and discusses the impact of training and testing with synthesized images (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
