This involves the use of minimum mean square error estimator, which is a common technique in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed scheme is relevant to networking and internet architecture as it aims to improve the performance of full-duplex systems by suppressing self-interference caused by oscillator phase noise. \n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper focuses on improving the performance of full-duplex communication systems by suppressing self-interference caused by oscillator phase noise. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed scheme involves the use of estimation and cancellation phases, which are common techniques in systems and control. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed scheme is relevant to multimedia applications as it aims to improve the performance of full-duplex systems, which are commonly used for multimedia communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
