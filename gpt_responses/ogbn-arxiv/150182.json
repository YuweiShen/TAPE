It specifically focuses on the use of speech and eye gaze modalities for continuous affect prediction. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), followed by cs.CL (Computation and Language) as the paper deals with speech analysis. The use of eye gaze features extracted from video suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper also proposes a baseline system and evaluates its performance, which falls under the sub-category of cs.SD (Sound)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
