The main focus is on managing inter-tier interference to offloaded users, which falls under the category of interference management in wireless networks. Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also utilizes tools from stochastic geometry to derive a tractable expression for the rate coverage probability, which falls under the category of mathematical modeling and analysis of wireless networks, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a likely sub-category as well. Additionally, the paper deals with optimizing the design parameter to maximize the rate coverage probability, which falls under the category of optimization in wireless networks, making cs.MM (Multimedia) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the performance of the interference nulling scheme in comparison to other schemes, which falls under the category of game theory and decision making in wireless networks, making cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
