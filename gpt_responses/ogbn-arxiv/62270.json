Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also mentions potential applications in kinesiology, medicine, sports, and robotics, indicating that it could also belong to cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) and cs.RO (Robotics). The use of deep learning models for regression tasks suggests that it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
