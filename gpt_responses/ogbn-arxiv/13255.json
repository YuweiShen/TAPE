It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as tracking pedestrians is an important task for autonomous robots. The paper also involves optimization and parameter estimation, which could place it in the statistical learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the use of video datasets suggests that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
