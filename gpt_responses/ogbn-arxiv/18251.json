This falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.AL). The paper also involves combinatorial optimization (cs.DM) and information theory (cs.IT) in the analysis of the approximation bounds. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the field of computational complexity (cs.CC) due to the impossibility result presented."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
