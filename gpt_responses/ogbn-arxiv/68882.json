Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it directly deals with building models from data. The paper also discusses the usability of AutoML systems, which falls under the category of Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of AI systems (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR) in AutoML. Finally, the paper also touches upon the importance of data management (cs.DB) in data science workflows."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
