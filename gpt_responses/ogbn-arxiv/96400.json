The task of named entity recognition falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP), which is typically covered by the arXiv sub-categories of cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also presents experiments using rule-based and deep learning systems, which are common techniques in machine learning and artificial intelligence, covered by the arXiv sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the use of deep learning models for named entity recognition suggests a potential overlap with the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
