This optimization problem can be framed as an information-theoretic problem, where the goal is to maximize the mutual information between the input and output signals subject to certain constraints. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the design of waveforms for wireless power transfer, which is a control problem involving the regulation of power flow between the transmitter and receiver. The proposed waveform design is based on a multisine waveform, which is a well-known technique in control theory for generating periodic signals with desired spectral properties. \n3. cs.EM (Electromagnetics): The paper deals with the design of waveforms for wireless power transfer, which is a problem in electromagnetics involving the transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves. The proposed waveform design takes into account the channel characteristics, which are determined by the propagation environment and the distance between the transmitter and receiver. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the design of waveforms for wireless power transfer, which is a problem in multimedia involving the transmission of power over wireless channels. The proposed waveform design is based on a multisine waveform, which is a technique commonly used in multimedia applications for generating complex signals with desired properties"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
