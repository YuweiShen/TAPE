It may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it deals with learning in a hybrid action space. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.RO (Robotics) as it applies the proposed framework to a simulated RoboCup soccer scenario. It may also be relevant to cs.GT (Game Theory) as it applies the framework to a computer game scenario. Finally, it could be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision) as it applies the framework to a game with visual inputs (King of Glory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
