This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of PCA for dimensionality reduction, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep residual networks also involves neural networks (cs.NE) and the evaluation of the proposed method involves datasets commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
