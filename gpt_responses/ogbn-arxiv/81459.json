The use of high-quality 3D scans and the development of a Deep Facial Detail Net (DFDN) based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Net (CGAN) also suggest a focus on graphics (GR) and multimedia (MM) aspects. The combination of supervised and unsupervised learning for facial detail synthesis indicates a potential interest in machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
