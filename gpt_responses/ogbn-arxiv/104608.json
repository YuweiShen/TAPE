The proposed method involves the use of minutiae histograms, which are a common feature extraction technique in fingerprint recognition and can be considered as an information retrieval problem (cs.IR). The evaluation of the method is based on publicly available databases, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
