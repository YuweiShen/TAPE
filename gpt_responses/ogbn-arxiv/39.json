The problem of finding the top-k nodes is related to social networks and preference aggregation, which are topics studied in the subfield of social and information networks (cs.SI). The paper also discusses post-processing methods and a standalone algorithm, which are related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The problem of finding the top-k nodes also has applications in social choice theory (cs.SOC) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
