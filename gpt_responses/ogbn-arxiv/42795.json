This is a problem that is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), data mining (cs.DM), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and information retrieval (cs.IR). Given that the paper focuses on improving classification accuracy and reducing computational costs, it is likely to be relevant to researchers in these sub-fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
