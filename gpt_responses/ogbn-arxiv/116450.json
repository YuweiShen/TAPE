It also discusses the regularization effect of batch normalization, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the impact of batch normalization on the conditioning of the loss landscape, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper proposes a new initialization scheme for deep residual networks, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of batch normalization in parallelizing training over large batch sizes, which is a topic in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
