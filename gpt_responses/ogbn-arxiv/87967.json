This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG the most likely category.\n2. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper deals with neural networks and proposes a new class of sparse neural networks. This makes cs.NE a likely category.\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper discusses the use of sparse neural networks in computer vision tasks, which makes cs.CV a likely category.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new class of neural networks that can improve the accuracy and performance of sparse neural networks. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI a likely category.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the use of hierarchical block structures to improve the performance of sparse neural networks.
