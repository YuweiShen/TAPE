The use of consensus-based algorithms and the focus on communication/computation tradeoffs suggest that the Learning (cs.LG) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories are also likely. The mention of expander graphs and the theoretical analysis of communication patterns suggest that the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category may also be relevant. Finally, the mention of experiments on a real cluster suggests that the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
