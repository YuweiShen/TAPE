The paper also proposes a new table space design, which involves data structures and algorithms, making it relevant to categories such as logic in computer science (cs.LO) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses experimental results, which may be relevant to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
