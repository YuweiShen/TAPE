The paper also introduces TorMentor, an anonymous hidden service that supports private multi-party ML. Given the focus on privacy and security, cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses federated learning, which falls under the purview of cs.LG (Machine Learning), making it the second most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses distributed computing and data management, which could fall under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) respectively. Finally, the paper discusses the trade-off between model accuracy and privacy, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
