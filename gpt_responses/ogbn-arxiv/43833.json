It also has applications in coding theory, specifically in determining the weight distribution of cyclic codes (cs.CR) and the correlation distribution among binary m-sequences (cs.DS). The paper involves computations over finite fields, which is a topic in algebraic geometry and number theory, and may be relevant to researchers in those areas as well (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses techniques from algebraic coding theory, which is a subfield of computer science (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
