These problems are often studied in the context of computational geometry (cs.CG) and information theory (cs.IT). The algorithm presented in the paper involves a sieving-like procedure, which is a common technique in data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper mentions a more general \"meta-theorem,\" which could potentially fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
