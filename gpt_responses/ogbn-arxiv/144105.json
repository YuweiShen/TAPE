Specifically, the paper focuses on algorithms that automatically search for compact network architectures, which is a subfield of deep learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper discusses the efficiency and scalability of these algorithms, it could also fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
