Additionally, the paper proposes a method for converting unstructured data into structured data, which is a common problem in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the need for effective storage and retrieval of data, which falls under the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The reduction stage of the proposed paradigm involves making sense of massive amounts of data, which is a common problem in Database (cs.DB) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
