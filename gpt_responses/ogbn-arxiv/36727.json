The use of innocent codebooks and the analysis of the channel parameters suggest a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The consideration of an adversary and the need for secrecy also suggest a possible connection to security and privacy (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
