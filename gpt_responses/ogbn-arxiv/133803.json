This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category. Additionally, the paper deals with information theory and communication theory, which are relevant to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) categories. The paper also involves system design and implementation, which could fall under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category. Finally, the paper mentions lab-scale experiments, which could be related to Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
