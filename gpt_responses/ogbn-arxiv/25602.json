This involves developing a robust optimization procedure that minimizes the worst case loss over a convex outer approximation of the set of activations reachable through a norm-bounded perturbation. The approach is illustrated on a toy 2D robust classification task and on a simple convolutional architecture applied to MNIST. Given the focus on deep learning and robustness against adversarial attacks, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses challenges in scaling the approach to larger domains, which suggests a potential fit with cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
