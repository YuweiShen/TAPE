The paper also considers delay-limited communications and signal-to-noise ratio targets, which are topics in information theory (cs.IT). The optimization problem of minimizing mission completion time subject to outage duration constraints involves control theory and optimization (cs.SY). The use of graph theory and convex optimization techniques in the proposed algorithms suggests the paper may also fall under robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
