The approach presented involves decomposition of a view into regularized surface patches and matching them through an optimal sequence comparison metric. This makes it likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. Additionally, the approach involves machine learning techniques for representing the surface patches and matching them, which makes it relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with geometric association, which makes it relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
