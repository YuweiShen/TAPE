The paper also proposes a coding scheme, which falls under the category of coding theory (cs.CC). The problem of joint distribution synthesis is related to control theory (cs.SY), and the paper discusses the concept of asymptotic strong coordination, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper mentions the use of $L^1$ distance, which is a measure of similarity commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
