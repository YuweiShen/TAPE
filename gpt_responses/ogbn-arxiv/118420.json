It also involves the design of distributed coding strategies, which falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC). The use of separate nodes and clusters in the system suggests that it may be related to networked systems (cs.NI) and system and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper analyzes the influence of adding a separate node, which could be considered a form of system optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
