The focus on term rewrite systems and theorem proving problems suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). Additionally, the mention of building a portfolio solver for choosing the most suitable tool for a given problem suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE). The use of structural features may also be relevant to programming languages (cs.PL) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
