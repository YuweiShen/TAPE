The use of annotations and object modeling also involves computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) techniques. The goal of reducing the complexity of CAD-like interfaces suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the use of machine learning and AI techniques may also be relevant (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
