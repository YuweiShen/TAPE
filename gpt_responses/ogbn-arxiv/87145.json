This involves training the SNNs using both indirect and direct end-to-end methods. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also involves robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as the methods used involve deep Q-learning and reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
