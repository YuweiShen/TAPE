The proposed algorithm is applied to a variety of regression and classification datasets, which suggests that the paper may also belong to computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the efficiency and computational cost of the proposed algorithm, which may indicate that it could also be relevant to data mining (cs.DM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
