The paper also discusses a novel decomposition technique for the maximum-likelihood metric, which could be relevant to signal processing and statistical inference (cs.SI, cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents simulation results to compare the proposed decoder with other methods, which could fall under the category of data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
