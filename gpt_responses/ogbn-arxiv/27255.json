The use of Fisher vectors and probabilistic integration suggests a machine learning approach (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of spatio-temporal features, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM). The proposed approach involves classification and segmentation, which are common topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of datasets and experiments, which suggests information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
