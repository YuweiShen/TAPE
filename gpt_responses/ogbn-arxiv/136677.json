This involves using functional annotations of reviewed proteins to predict those of non-reviewed proteins. The approach involves building a distributed system using the \"akka\" toolkit for building resilient distributed message-driven applications. This work involves machine learning, graph theory, and distributed computing, which are all relevant to several sub-categories in computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DB (Databases), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
