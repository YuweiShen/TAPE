This involves exploring the use of Wold processes, which are commonly used in time series analysis. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) as well as Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Information Theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper involves developing algorithms for processing large datasets, which could also place it in the sub-categories of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
