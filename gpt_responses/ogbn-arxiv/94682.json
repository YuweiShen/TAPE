The proposed method also involves the use of neural networks to learn object semantics and generate color distributions, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions experiments on two datasets, PASCAL VOC2012 and COCO-stuff, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research.
