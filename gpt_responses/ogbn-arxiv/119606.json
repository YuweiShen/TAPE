The paper compares Simple Word-Embedding-based Models (SWEMs) with word-embedding-based RNN/CNN models, which are commonly used in NLP. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the performance of different pooling strategies, which is related to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper presents experiments on text classification and tagging, which are tasks related to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
