This falls under the scope of game theory.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves the use of noisy signals and independent draws, which are common concepts in machine learning. Additionally, the study of fairness goals in decision-making can also be considered a machine learning problem.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves decision-making and fairness goals, which are both relevant topics in artificial intelligence.\n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the use of an informative grading policy and its impact on achieving fairness goals. This can be related to security and privacy concerns in decision-making.\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper involves the study of fairness goals in a two-stage model involving multiple agents. This can be related to social and information networks, where decision-making and fairness are important considerations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
