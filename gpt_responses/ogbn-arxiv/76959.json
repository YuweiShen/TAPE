The focus is on the distance properties of codes, which is also relevant to cryptography (cs.CR). The paper proposes low-complexity decoding algorithms, which falls under the category of distributed systems (cs.DS). The use of subcodes and their properties is a topic in coding theory, which is related to signal processing and information theory (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed codes, which could fall under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
