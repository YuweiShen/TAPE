The proposed method involves predicting signed distance maps (SDMs) directly from medical scans, which is a machine learning task (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also deals with medical imaging and healthcare applications (cs.MED). Finally, the proposed method involves the use of neural networks, which is a topic in neuroscience and computational neuroscience (cs.NEURON)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
