This approach is based on the observation that detecting and handling extreme cases in a specialized way leads to better crowd estimation. The paper also addresses the issue of differentiating between the actual crowd and the cluttered background regions. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) are also possible categories since the paper deals with image analysis and classification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
