The paper discusses the use of truncated back-propagation as a heuristic to approximate gradients in bilevel optimization, which is a common technique in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
