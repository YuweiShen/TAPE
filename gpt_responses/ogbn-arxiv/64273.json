Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new approach to improve the performance of the model, which involves adding an additional alignment head to the multi-head source-to-target attention component. This approach involves training the model to compute sharper attention weights, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), making cs.AI and cs.LG likely sub-categories as well. Additionally, the paper proposes alignment pruning to speed up decoding in alignment-based neural machine translation (ANMT), which falls under the category of neural networks (NE), making cs.NE a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper also carries out experiments on the shared WMT 2016 English$\\to$Romanian news task and the BOLT Chinese$\\to$English discussion forum task, which involves computer vision (CV) and speech processing, respectively, making cs.CV a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
