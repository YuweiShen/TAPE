The paper specifically focuses on developing a new training strategy for incremental learning, which involves learning strong classifiers and data representation simultaneously, making it highly relevant to the aforementioned sub-categories. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG and cs.CV, followed by cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
