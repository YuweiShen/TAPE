The authors also train support vector machines for classification of cognitive tasks. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper uses local descriptors called Mesh Arc Descriptors (MADs) obtained from fMRI data by forming local meshes around anatomical regions and estimating their relationship within a neighborhood. This is a common technique used in computer vision for feature extraction. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper deals with analyzing brain connectivity patterns using fMRI data, which is a common area of research in neural and evolutionary computing. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel framework for encoding brain connectivity patterns and classifying cognitive tasks, which falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper does not directly deal with natural language processing, but the authors suggest a new method to visualize the codewords of brain connectivity dictionary, which could potentially be applied to language data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
