This is a problem that arises in various fields, including signal processing, machine learning, and computer vision. The approach proposed in the paper is based on convex optimization and has applications in demixing two signals that are sparse in mutually incoherent bases, decoding spread-spectrum transmissions in the presence of impulsive errors, and removing sparse corruptions from a low-rank matrix. These applications suggest that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
