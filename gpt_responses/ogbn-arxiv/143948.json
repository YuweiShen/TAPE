The paper also introduces hierarchical modulation and evaluates its performance, which is a common topic in information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the design of a communication system, which is a core topic in networking and internet architecture. The paper also evaluates various strategies to group the receivers, which is a common problem in network design.\n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper discusses the design of a communication system and evaluates its performance, which are core topics in communication and networking.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new modulation scheme and evaluates its performance, which involves designing and analyzing algorithms for data transmission.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the design of a communication system and evaluates its performance, which are core topics in systems and control. The paper also proposes a new modulation scheme, which involves designing and analyzing control systems for data transmission."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
