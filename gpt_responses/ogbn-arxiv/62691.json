The use of deep networks and transfer learning also suggests a potential fit for the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) in terms of collecting and labeling the auxiliary dataset. The use of AdaBoost-like transfer learning algorithm and CNN model suggests a potential fit for the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the issue of fake images and their impact on credibility, which could potentially fit under the computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
