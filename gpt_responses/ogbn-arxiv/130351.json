The study involves user perception and interaction with virtual surfaces, which suggests a strong connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and social and information networks (cs.SI). The use of visual modification and oscillation also suggests a connection to graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the study involves analyzing and processing visual data, which suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
