The proposed algorithm uses word embeddings to learn global semantics of entities, which is a technique commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL). The algorithm also deals with feature explosion and scalability issues, which are common problems in large-scale databases (cs.DB). The paper proposes a selective path exploration strategy, which involves exploring paths between entities, a task that is related to information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper proposes a new algorithm for path ranking, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
