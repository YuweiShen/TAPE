The focus is on rank-metric codes, which are used in coding theory (cs.IT) and have applications in network coding (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of locality constraints, which is a topic in distributed systems (cs.DS) and parallel computing (cs.CC). Finally, the paper proposes a construction method that builds upon a previous method for constructing locally repairable codes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.IT) and distributed storage systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
