This problem is typically studied in the computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS) sub-categories. The paper also involves a careful manual analysis, which suggests that it may belong to the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-category. Additionally, the use of interval arithmetic in the automatic part of the proof suggests that the paper may also belong to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. Finally, the paper's relevance to recursive packing algorithms suggests that it may also belong to the computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
