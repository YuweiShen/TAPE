The approach is applied to control systems, which suggests the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the generalization of functional relations, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of neural networks for equation learning is a key aspect of the paper, which is relevant to the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the experiments involve a cart-pendulum system, which is a common topic in robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
