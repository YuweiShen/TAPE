The paper discusses the spectral bias phenomenon, which is related to the convergence rate of neural networks during training. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the application of these concepts to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), which further supports these sub-categories as likely candidates."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
