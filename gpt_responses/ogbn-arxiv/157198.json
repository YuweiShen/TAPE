The design of a memory interconnect for DNN accelerators involves hardware design and optimization, which falls under the category of Embedded Systems (cs.ET) and Digital Circuits (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the use of interconnects to connect DNN layer processors to the FPGA's DRAM controller, which falls under the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a new design for the interconnect, which involves optimization and performance analysis, which falls under the category of Architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
