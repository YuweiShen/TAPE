The authors propose a Machine Learning framework for learning elimination rules that yield high-quality chordal extensions, which involves techniques from both Machine Learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) and Combinatorial Optimization (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the current research trend of looking at Combinatorial Optimization tasks through a Machine Learning lens, which falls under the category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
