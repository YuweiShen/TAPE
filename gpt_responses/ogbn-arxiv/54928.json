The proposed method involves low-complexity approximation, which is a common theme in signal processing (cs.SP) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also considers the impact of channel correlation, which is a topic in statistical signal processing (cs.ST). Finally, the paper analyzes the performance of the proposed method in terms of sum-rate, which is a metric commonly used in communication systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
