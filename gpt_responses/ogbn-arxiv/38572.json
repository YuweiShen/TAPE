The paper also discusses the use of the Hough transform for this task, which is a well-known technique in robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM) applications. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach that incorporates connectivity in the voting process, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
