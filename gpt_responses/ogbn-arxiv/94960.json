This falls under the domain of information theory. \n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) - The paper discusses the limitations of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations in modern communication systems and proposes an alternative scheme based on RAPSK modulations. This falls under the domain of communications and networking. \n3. cs.SI (Signal Processing) - The paper discusses the effects of phase noise on QAM constellations and proposes a solution based on RAPSK modulations. This falls under the domain of signal processing. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a novel multistage decoding scheme for soft-input decoding of component codes. This falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the limitations of QAM constellations in practical high-data rate systems and proposes an alternative scheme based on RAPSK modulations. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
