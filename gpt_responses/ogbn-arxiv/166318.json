This falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also mentions the use of small memory occupation and fast behavior on real data, which suggests that it may also belong to the categories of data structures (cs.DS) and data mining (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the use of marching and nearest neighbor algorithms, which are commonly used in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
