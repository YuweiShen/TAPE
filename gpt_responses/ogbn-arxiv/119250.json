The paper also discusses the performance of these codes in terms of security against attacks, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The use of coding schemes in quantum communication systems also involves the study of electronic engineering (cs.ET). The paper also mentions the use of numerical simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed codes, which is related to mathematical modeling (cs.MM). Finally, the design of error correction codes for quantum communication systems involves the study of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
