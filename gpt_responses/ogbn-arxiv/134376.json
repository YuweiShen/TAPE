The proposed methodology and fault classification can also be useful for software engineering (cs.SE) and electronics and embedded systems (cs.ET). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential impact of these EM pulse effects on control-flow hijacking, which is a topic related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
