The proposed method uses a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a popular machine learning technique in multimedia (cs.MM) and computer security (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the use of low-order high pass filters, which are commonly used in image processing (cs.IR). Lastly, the paper presents a binary/multiple classifier, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
