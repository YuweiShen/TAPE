This suggests a focus on managing and analyzing large amounts of digital scientific data, which is a key aspect of the Digital Libraries sub-category.\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of text-mining techniques for analyzing scientific discourses, which is a key aspect of Information Retrieval. The focus on visualization and clustering of scientific documents also suggests a connection to this sub-category.\n3. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper involves the use of natural language processing techniques for analyzing scientific discourses, which is a key aspect of Computation and Language. The focus on topic modeling and document clustering also suggests a connection to this sub-category.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the use of science mapping techniques for analyzing scientific discourses, which involves the study of networks of scientific concepts and their relationships. This suggests a connection to the Social and Information Networks sub-category.\n5. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the analysis of a long-standing interdisciplinary discourse, which involves the study of the social and cultural aspects of scientific research.
