The use of Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM) and an approximate inference algorithm also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The mention of a supplemental video suggests that it could also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Finally, the use of duality between control and estimation suggests that it could belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
