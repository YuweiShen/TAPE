The paper proposes a transmission rate selection algorithm and a cross-layer framework jointly combining transmission rate adaptation and user scheduling techniques, considering both HARQ and ICI. The problem involves network communication, information theory, and optimization, which are the main topics of the cs.NI, cs.IT, and cs.MM sub-categories. The paper also proposes a statistical approximation method for analyzing the effective SINR with the HARQ technique at users, which involves modeling and simulation, which are the main topics of the cs.SY and cs.GT sub-categories. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NI, cs.IT, cs.MM, cs.SY, and cs.GT, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
