The paper also mentions the use of QUBO models in quantum computing and neuromorphic computing, which are both areas of computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.OC (Optimization and Control). Other likely sub-categories include cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
