This involves using a deep neural network as a function approximator and requires no specific state information. The paper also discusses the use of human interaction to further refine the model. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, since the paper uses image input, cs.CV (Computer Vision) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, since the paper deals with autonomous vehicles, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
