It also involves supervised learning techniques (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) as it deals with road scene simulations. Additionally, it relates to robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY) as it aims to imitate expert autonomous driving systems over long time horizons."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
