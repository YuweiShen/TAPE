The paper also proposes a new algorithm for fitting the 3DMM in arbitrary images, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) research. Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of building statistical texture models for faces captured in unconstrained conditions, which relates to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) research. Finally, the paper proposes a new statistical model for facial shape and texture, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
