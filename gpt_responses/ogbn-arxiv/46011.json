It also discusses the use of hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) and fixed-blocklength schemes with no feedback (FBL-NF) in short-packet communications. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), followed by cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses the use of pilot-assisted transmission to estimate the fading channel, which falls under the category of cs.COM (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science). Finally, the paper deals with the security aspect of communication systems, which falls under the category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
