The paper proposes a novel deep network, named as Dynamic Context Correspondence Network (DCCNet), which incorporates global semantic context in a flexible manner to overcome the limitations of prior work that relies on local semantic representations. The paper also proposes a context-aware semantic representation that incorporates spatial layout for robust matching against local ambiguities. Given these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with multimedia (cs.MM) and natural language processing (cs.CL) to some extent, as it uses attention mechanisms and multi-auxiliary task loss to improve the efficiency of the weakly-supervised learning procedure."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
