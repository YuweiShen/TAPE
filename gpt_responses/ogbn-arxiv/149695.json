The paper also involves the manipulation of pixels and channels in images, which falls under the sub-category of Multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses the imperceptibility and robustness of the steganography technique, which are important factors in Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Information Theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach for achieving the desired targets, which involves the use of a complete random scheme and cyclic methodology, which are relevant to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
