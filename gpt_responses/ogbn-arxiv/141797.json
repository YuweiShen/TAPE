This makes cs.DS a likely sub-category.\n\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Nonnegative matrix factorization is a popular technique in machine learning, and the paper presents an algorithm for computing approximate PSD factorizations. This makes cs.LG a likely sub-category.\n\n3. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper involves computing approximate factorizations of matrices, which is a topic in numerical analysis. This makes cs.NA a likely sub-category.\n\n4. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper involves analyzing the approximation error in the factorization algorithm, which is a topic in information theory. This makes cs.IT a likely sub-category.\n\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not directly involve social or information networks, but the technique of nonnegative matrix factorization has been used in analyzing social and information networks.
