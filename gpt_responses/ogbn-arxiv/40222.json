Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces new ways of initialization and loss functions, which suggests it could belong to cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper deals with video stylization, which could fall under cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper proposes a way to adapt the approaches to 360-degree images and videos, which could fall under cs.GR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
