The approach proposed in the paper involves using a bimodal co-sparse analysis model to capture the interdependency of registered intensity and depth information. This model is based on the assumption that the co-supports of corresponding bimodal image structures are aligned when computed by a suitable pair of analysis operators. The paper proposes a method for learning these operators from a set of registered training signals, which is done offline and returns a bimodal analysis operator that is universally applicable to natural scenes. The approach is then used to solve inverse problems, which leads to an efficient algorithm for depth map super-resolution. Given the focus on computer vision and image processing, as well as the use of machine learning techniques, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
