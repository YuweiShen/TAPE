The paper focuses on nonsymmetric DPPs, which allow for both repulsive and attractive item interactions, and proposes a method for learning these models from data. This work is likely to be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data science (cs.DS), computer vision (cs.CV), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
