The paper proposes a new notion of strong simulation for graph pattern matching, which involves identifying criteria for preserving the topology of graphs matched. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational geometry (cs.CG), which often deal with graph-based data structures and algorithms. Finally, the paper presents experimental results using real-life and synthetic data, indicating that it may also be relevant to the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
