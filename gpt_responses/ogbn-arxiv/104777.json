The use of surrogates and transfer learning is also a popular topic in the field. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also mentions the use of neural networks, which suggests the possibility of it being categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the use of transfer learning and surrogate modeling can also be relevant to the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
