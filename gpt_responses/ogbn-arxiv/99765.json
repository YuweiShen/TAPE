This topic is closely related to machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also presents a new class of RNNs that compute an element-wise weighted sum of context-independent functions of the input, which is relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
