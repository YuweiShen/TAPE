The paper discusses a novel learning algorithm and a PFC-like module that enable networks to continually learn different mapping rules. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), which deals with the study of artificial neural networks and their applications. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of DNNs for recognition and classification, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of sensory features, which could place it in the cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) sub-category. \n\nThe paper also discusses the ability of the networks to work in complex and dynamical situations, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of a PFC-like module, which could place it in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category, which deals with the study of intelligent agents and their applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
