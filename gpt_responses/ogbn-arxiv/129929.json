The use of experiments to obtain a better understanding of the problem is also a common approach in machine learning (cs.LG). The implementation and evaluation of the agent on the experimentation platform Malmo suggests a focus on robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the utilization of causal information for knowledge transfer between agents suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
