The proposed framework focuses on exploiting the difficulties in learning to boost the machine learning process. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers papers that focus on the development of machine learning algorithms and models. The proposed framework in this paper falls under this category as it involves the use of neural networks to predict emotions.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category covers papers that focus on computer vision and image processing. The use of facial expressions and physiology as expressive modalities in this paper suggests that it could belong to this category.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): This sub-category covers papers that focus on the interaction between humans and computers. The use of different expressive modalities to predict emotions suggests that this paper could belong to this category.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): This sub-category covers papers that focus on multimedia processing and analysis. The use of different expressive modalities such as speech, face, and physiology in this paper suggests that it could belong to this category.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category covers papers that focus on natural language processing and computational linguistics.
