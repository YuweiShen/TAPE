The paper also introduces a new concept of subset seeds and proposes an efficient automaton construction for them. These topics are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), databases (cs.DB), machine learning (cs.LG), computational complexity (cs.CC), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
