The paper proposes a new iterative algorithm that utilizes the proximal-gradient method to find a sparse total least-squares solution by minimizing an l1-regularized Rayleigh-quotient cost function. This algorithm is designed specifically for fully-perturbed CS setups, where both the projected measurements of an unknown sparse vector and the knowledge of the associated projection matrix are perturbed due to noise, error, mismatch, etc. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category deals with the mathematical foundations of information and communication, including coding theory, data compression, and signal processing, which are all relevant to the problem addressed in the paper. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data, which is also relevant to the proposed algorithm for finding a sparse solution. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category deals with the analysis and interpretation of visual data, which may be relevant to the application of the proposed algorithm in image and video processing. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): This sub-category deals with the"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
