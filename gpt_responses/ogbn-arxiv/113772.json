These properties are closely related to information theory (cs.IT), signal processing (cs.SP), numerical analysis (cs.NA), machine learning (cs.LG), and mathematical modeling (cs.MM). The paper also presents a constructive result that shows the RIP-NSP is stronger than NSP, which is of interest to researchers in these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
