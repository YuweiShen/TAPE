Therefore, cs.BIO is a likely category. The paper also focuses on the practical implementation and experimental validation of the method, which suggests categories such as cs.DS and cs.CE. The use of FM indices for read mapping and information retrieval also suggests categories such as cs.IR and cs.DB."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
