This involves optimizing the phase shifts of the incoming electromagnetic waves at the IRS to boost signal power. This problem involves joint design of AirComp transceivers and IRS phase shifts, which is a highly intractable nonconvex bi-quadratic programming problem. Therefore, the paper proposes a novel alternating difference-of-convex (DC) programming algorithm to solve this problem. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are as follows: \n\n1. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the optimization of signal power in wireless networks, which is a core problem in information theory. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a system that utilizes intelligent reflecting surfaces to improve wireless data aggregation, which is a key problem in networking and internet architecture. \n\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an intelligent reflecting surface aided AirComp system to build controllable wireless environments, which involves system design and control. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with wireless data aggregation, which is a key problem in multimedia applications such as video streaming. \n\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel alternating difference-of-convex (DC) programming algorithm to solve"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
