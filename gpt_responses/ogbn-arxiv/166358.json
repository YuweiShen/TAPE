The paper compares two approaches for learning to maximize F-measures: empirical utility maximization (EUM) and decision-theoretic. These approaches are commonly used in the sub-fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI), particularly in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the handling of rare classes and domain adaptation, which are relevant topics in computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
