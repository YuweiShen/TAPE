This involves the use of rateless codes with frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation scheme to overcome power cost concerns in tiny implantable sensors. This suggests that the paper could belong to the following sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory) - as rateless codes are a topic of interest in information theory. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - as the paper discusses wireless implant technology and communication protocols. \n- cs.EM (Electromagnetics) - as the paper discusses the propagation of signals across the human body. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control) - as the paper discusses power management and energy efficiency in wireless biomedical implant systems. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning) - as the paper mentions optimization of modulation and coding parameters, which could involve machine learning techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
