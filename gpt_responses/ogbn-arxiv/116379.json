The paper also discusses the specialization of student nodes to teacher nodes, which is a common topic in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper includes experiments on image classification, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Finally, the paper analyzes the effect of over-realization on the training dynamics, which is related to the optimization and generalization of neural networks, a topic that is often studied in the statistical learning (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
