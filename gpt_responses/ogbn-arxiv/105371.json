The paper also discusses the comparison of different networks, regularization and optimization procedures, stability of network classification, and estimation of confidence in classification, which are all topics related to machine learning (cs.LG). The use of images and feature space also suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) may be a relevant sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential for investigating natural language processing (cs.CL) applications of the visualization method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
