The use of LVFC bound suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Additionally, the paper may be relevant to the subfield of communication complexity (cs.CC) as constant composition codes have applications in this area. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of signal processing (cs.SI) as constant composition codes have applications in signal transmission and error correction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
