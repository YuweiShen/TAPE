The paper also discusses the use of deformable convolutional networks, which is a recent development in deep learning and falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The paper also mentions the use of adaptive receptive fields, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks for image processing and falls under the neural networks (cs.NE) category. Finally, the paper uses public datasets to test the proposed method, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
