The constructions and bounds involve combinatorial and algebraic techniques, which are commonly used in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and coding theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the probabilistic method, which is a common tool in computer science (cs.DS). The topic of error detection and tolerance is relevant to computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the use of finite fields, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
