The proposed framework involves optimizing similarity metrics, which is a common task in machine learning (cs.MM). The paper also involves information retrieval, as it aims to retrieve face images based on specific criteria (cs.IR). The quartet-based model proposed in the paper involves optimization, which is a common task in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper proposes a novel framework for face retrieval, which involves artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
