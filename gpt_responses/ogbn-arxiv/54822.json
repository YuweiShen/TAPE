The paper also proposes a new method for reducing computational complexity, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of smaller convolutional layers and feature co-occurrence is also related to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed method on various datasets involves multimedia (cs.MM) aspects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
