This suggests a computational engineering aspect to the work.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the benefits of online treatment planning systems for clinicians, including off-site accessibility, data sharing, and professional interaction. This suggests a focus on the societal impact of the technology.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions the segmentation of patient images for use in simulated treatments of cancer, which suggests a computer vision aspect to the work.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper describes a web-based system for managing simulation components, which could potentially involve multimedia elements such as videos or images.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the use of a domain model to relate entities from theoretical, engineering, and clinical domains, which suggests an information theory aspect to the work."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
