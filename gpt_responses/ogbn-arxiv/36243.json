The use of OFDM and MIMO techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The algorithms presented for synchronization and channel estimation may fall under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the use of massive MIMO suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category, as MIMO techniques are commonly used in wireless multimedia communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
