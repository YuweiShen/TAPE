This falls under the domain of information theory and communication systems, which are covered by the cs.IT and cs.COMM sub-categories. The paper also employs mathematical induction and Fourier-Motzkin elimination, which are techniques commonly used in optimization and linear algebra, respectively. Therefore, the paper may also be relevant to the cs.SI, cs.NI, and cs.MA sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
