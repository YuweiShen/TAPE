The paper presents experimental results on several popular datasets derived from WordNet, FreeBase and ConceptNet, and investigates two NAM structures, namely deep neural networks (DNN) and relation-modulated neural nets (RMNN), on several probabilistic reasoning tasks in AI, including recognizing textual entailment, triple classification in multi-relational knowledge bases and commonsense reasoning. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper deals with deep learning and probabilistic reasoning in AI. The sub-categories cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) are less likely, as they are not directly related to the topic of the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
