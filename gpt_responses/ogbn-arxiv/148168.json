This topic is closely related to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI), as well as computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses architectural choices and regularization techniques, which are also relevant to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
