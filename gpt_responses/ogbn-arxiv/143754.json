The use of stochastic geometry to model the base station deployment suggests a connection to mathematical aspects of wireless networks (cs.MA). The comparison of the model with an actual base station deployment involves data analysis and statistics (cs.SI). Finally, the optimization of the base station deployment can be seen as a problem in game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
