The paper also proposes a framework that utilizes perturbations to enhance utility, which involves statistical and information theory concepts that are relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. Finally, the paper presents experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which suggests that the authors may have used data science (cs.DS) techniques to analyze the data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
