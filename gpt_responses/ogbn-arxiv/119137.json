The paper also introduces the concept of virtual convex hulls, which is a geometric approach to update the distances and angles between agents even when they move out of range, and this approach can be applied to various types of networks (cs.NI). The paper proposes a linear update algorithm to track the locations of mobile agents, which involves modeling the system as a Linear Time-Varying (LTV) system, and this algorithm can be used in various applications such as surveillance and monitoring (cs.SY, cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
