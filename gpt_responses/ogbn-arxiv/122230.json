Additionally, the use of deep neural networks for pre-training and supervised learning suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The concept of memorization infrastructure learned by the network during random-label training may also suggest a connection to neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the use of video datasets may suggest a connection to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
