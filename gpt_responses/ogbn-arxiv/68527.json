The use of oracles and the focus on polyhedral cones suggest a connection to computational geometry and optimization, which are covered by cs.DS and cs.DM. The paper also mentions the use of linear programming and combinatorial optimization techniques, which are relevant to cs.CC and cs.GT. Finally, the presentation of fully polynomial-time approximation algorithms (FPTASs) suggests a connection to numerical analysis and algorithms, which are covered by cs.NA."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
