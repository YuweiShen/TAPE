The paper specifically focuses on exploration in RL, which is a common problem in RL research. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which is the broadest category for machine learning research. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of parameter noise in RL, which is a technique that can be used in various RL algorithms. Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also a likely sub-category. \n\nThe experiments in the paper involve both discrete and continuous action spaces, which suggests that the paper could also be categorized under cs.RO (Robotics) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). \n\nFinally, the paper uses deep neural networks as function approximators, which is a common technique in RL research. Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a possible sub-category. \n\nOverall, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG and cs.AI, followed by cs.RO, cs.SY, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
