This involves information retrieval techniques and algorithms. \n\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper focuses on monitoring multiple language versions of Wikipedia and detecting concurrent edit spikes of articles covering the same topics, which can be treated as signals for potential breaking news events. This involves analyzing social and information networks. \n\n3. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - The paper mentions full-text cross-language searches on multiple social networks, which involves natural language processing and computational linguistics techniques. \n\n4. cs.SD (Software Engineering) - The paper describes the development of an application called Wikipedia Live Monitor, which involves software engineering principles and practices. \n\n5. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses the potential impact of false-positive alerts in breaking news detection and proposes an approach that is less prone to such alerts. This involves ethical and societal considerations related to the use of technology for news detection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
