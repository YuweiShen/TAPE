The paper also proposes a non-convex optimization and a regularized convex relaxation, which are techniques commonly used in the field of machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
