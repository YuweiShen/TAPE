This falls under the domain of database systems. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper specifically deals with tuning the configuration of distributed analytics engines such as Spark. This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to this sub-category. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses Bayesian optimization, which is a popular technique in machine learning for hyperparameter tuning. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new approach for efficiently tuning the configuration of big data analytics systems. This falls under the domain of software engineering. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper uses sensitivity analysis and Bayesian optimization to efficiently search a high-dimensional configuration space. This involves the use of algorithms and data structures, which is relevant to this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
