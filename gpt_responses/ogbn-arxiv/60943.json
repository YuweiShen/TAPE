This involves learning to learn learning algorithms, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of homogeneous experts and the modularity of the proposed architecture suggest a potential application in robotics (cs.RO) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Finally, the focus on adaptation and learning to adapt suggests a potential application in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
