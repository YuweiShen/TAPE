The approach takes into account dynamics constraints and uses a data-driven method to accelerate the forward dynamic computation, which involves system identification (cs.SY) and machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions optimization-based motion planning and reinforcement-learning-based feedback control, which are common techniques in computer vision (cs.CV) for robotics applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
