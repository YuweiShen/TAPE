The use of regularization and optimization techniques also suggests that the paper could belong to the information theory (cs.IT) or machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the application of the proposed method to remote sensing data implies that it could also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
