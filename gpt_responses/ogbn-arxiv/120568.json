Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Information Theory (cs.IT), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Signal Processing (cs.SI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Multimedia (cs.MM). Among these, cs.IT and cs.CV are the most likely categories as the paper deals with blind deconvolution and blind demixing, which are common problems in these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
