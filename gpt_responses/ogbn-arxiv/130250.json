The paper specifically focuses on deep learning, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of trusted hardware enclaves and differential privacy also suggests a focus on distributed computing (cs.DC) and system design (cs.SY). Finally, the application of these techniques to machine learning suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
