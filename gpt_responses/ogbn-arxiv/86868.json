The use of sensors and probability density functions suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV). The mention of confounds and Lagrangian variations suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the computational experiments and real-world applications suggest that the paper may also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
