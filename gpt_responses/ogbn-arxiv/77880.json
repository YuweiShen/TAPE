This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper also discusses communication systems and signal processing algorithms, which are relevant to the sub-categories of communications (cs.COMM) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of simulations, which is relevant to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
