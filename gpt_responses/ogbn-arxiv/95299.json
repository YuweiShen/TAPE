The use of K-means networks and SVDD algorithms suggests that the paper may fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments conducted on object recognition benchmarks also suggest that the paper may fall under the categories of neural networks (cs.NE) or natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
