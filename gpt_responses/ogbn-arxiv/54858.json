This is a topic that is closely related to information theory (cs.IT), as well as to data structures (cs.DS), distributed computing (cs.DC), coding theory (cs.CC), and signal processing (cs.SI). Given the focus on rate bounds and constructions, cs.IT and cs.CC are the most likely categories, followed by cs.DS and cs.DC, which are relevant for the design of efficient algorithms for local recovery. Finally, cs.SI is a possible category given the connection with signal processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
