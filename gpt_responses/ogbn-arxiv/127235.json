This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Machine Learning (cs.LG). However, since the paper focuses on the development of computational algorithms for the DGTs and their applications in signal and image processing, cs.IT and cs.SP are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
