The paper proposes a new method for solving this problem by considering a sparse signal model with non-stationary modulations. This problem is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), signal processing (cs.SP), machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and scientific computing (cs.SI). However, given the focus on signal processing and sparse recovery, we believe that cs.IT and cs.SP are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.LG, cs.CV, and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
