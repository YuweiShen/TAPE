The use of convolutional networks and spectral networks suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the mention of large-scale classification problems suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) or social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
