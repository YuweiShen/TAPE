The use of LP relaxations and rounding schemes suggests a focus on optimization and algorithms, which are common in the cs.GT (game theory) and cs.DS (data structures and algorithms) sub-categories. The paper also deals with Bayesian incentive compatibility, which is a key concept in artificial intelligence and machine learning, making cs.AI a likely sub-category.
