Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the training and finetuning of the CNNs, which suggests that it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. The paper also mentions the use of data augmentation and the design of a two-stage approach for character segmentation and recognition, which could place it in the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) category. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed system's performance on two datasets, which could suggest that it belongs to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
