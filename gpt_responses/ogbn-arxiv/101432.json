The use of deep learning models for segmentation also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The mention of ensemble models and hyper-parameters also suggests that it could belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the mention of radiomic features suggests that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
