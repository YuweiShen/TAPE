The paper also mentions the RegularChains library in Maple, which is a well-known tool for solving polynomial systems. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The paper also discusses the division of the parametric space into sub-spaces, which suggests a connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
