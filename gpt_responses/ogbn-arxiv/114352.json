This falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) and algorithmic game theory (cs.GT). The use of block-wise optimization and virtual coordinate systems suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The application of arbitrary unrestricted algorithms and the use of bijections suggest a connection to neural networks and machine learning (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
