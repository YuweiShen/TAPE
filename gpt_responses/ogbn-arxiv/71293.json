It introduces a new method called recombination, which is based on the concept of equivalence of partial hypotheses. This paper is likely to belong to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) sub-category of Computer Science (cs.CL) since it deals with NMT, which is a subfield of NLP. Additionally, the paper uses neural connections and representations, which are common in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also mentions experiments on large-scale translation tasks, which could fall under the Neural Networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper could also be relevant to Computer Vision (cs.CV) since NMT can be used for image captioning and other visual tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
