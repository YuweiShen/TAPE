The paper also involves large-deviations analysis and central limit asymptotics, which are common techniques in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and signal processing (cs.SI), as these fields often involve optimization problems and statistical analysis. Finally, the paper may be relevant to the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), as communication channels are a key component of network architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
