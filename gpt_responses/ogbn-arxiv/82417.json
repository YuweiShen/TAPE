This falls under the purview of information theory.\n2. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper discusses the transmission of 16 QAM symbols in a 1-bit massive MU-MISO downlink system. This is a communication and networking problem.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not explicitly deal with social networks, but the use of a MU-MISO system implies the presence of multiple users, which can be modeled as a social network.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a downlink system, which is a part of networking and internet architecture.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper does not deal with data structures and algorithms explicitly, but the precoding technique used can be seen as an algorithmic approach to mitigate MUI and distortions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
