The paper proposes a new approach to out-of-distribution detection (OOD) that provides provably low confidence predictions far away from the training data. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
