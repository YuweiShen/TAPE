This falls under the domain of computer architecture.\n- cs.PF (Performance): The paper focuses on accurately estimating the performance of GPU kernels under different frequency settings, which is a key aspect of performance analysis.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) in GPUs, which is a control problem. It also proposes a model to estimate performance, which is a system-level approach.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper deals with GPU computing, which is a form of parallel computing. It also proposes a model to estimate performance, which is relevant to distributed and cluster computing as well.\n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): GPUs are an emerging technology that are increasingly being used for high-performance computing. The paper proposes a model to estimate performance with frequency scaling, which is a relevant topic in the context of emerging GPU technologies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
