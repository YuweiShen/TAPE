The paper proposes a method for zero-resource NMT, which means training an NMT model without parallel corpora available. This is a challenging problem in NMT and requires techniques from machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method involves using a pivot language to train the NMT model, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) for domain adaptation. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method using BLEU score, which is a common metric in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
