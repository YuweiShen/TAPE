This involves joint iterative optimization of filters based on the minimization of the bit error rate (BER) cost function. The paper also introduces stochastic gradient (SG) algorithms for adaptive implementation and a novel automatic rank selection method based on the BER criterion. These techniques are relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), signal processing (cs.SI), machine learning (cs.LG), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
