This topic falls under the category of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses security and fault tolerance, which are relevant to the category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). The protocol involves communication between nodes, which falls under the category of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the performance of the protocol, which falls under the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY).
