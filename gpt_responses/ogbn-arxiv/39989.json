This makes cs.NI the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - The paper focuses on the application of WBAN in Ubiquitous Healthcare (UHC) and how it can benefit elderly people. This makes cs.HC a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses different standards used in WBAN and their impact on communication. This makes cs.IT a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the system on chip and low power sensor nodes used in WBAN. This makes cs.SY a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.EM (Emerging Technologies) - The paper discusses the advances in wireless communication and low power sensor nodes that have enabled the realization of WBAN.
