It may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it involves adapting the model on-the-fly. Additionally, the use of feature maps suggests that it could be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and data structures (cs.DS) sub-categories. Finally, the use of gradient descent suggests that it could be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
