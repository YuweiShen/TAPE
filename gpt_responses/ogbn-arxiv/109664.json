The paper also leverages large-scale pre-trained models such as BERT and GPT-2, which are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning research (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper addresses the challenges of natural language generation, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of pre-trained models and the generation of missing sentences also involves neural networks and optimization techniques, which are relevant to the subfield of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses techniques for document auto-completion and meeting note expansion, which are related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
