Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of reliable information transmission and storage. The paper also involves network communication, which falls under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The proposed method involves optimization, which is a common theme in cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also deals with MIMO systems, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper involves machine learning algorithms, which is a common theme in cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
