The paper also compares the numerical performance of the proposed distances on generative modeling tasks, which falls under the computer vision sub-category cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The use of the Radon transform and probability measures suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper discusses the conditions under which the proposed distances are indeed distances, which could fall under the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
