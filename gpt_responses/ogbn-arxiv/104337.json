This falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS). The paper also presents algorithms that are space-efficient and have linear time complexity, which are topics of interest in computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of Lyndon arrays is also relevant in combinatorics (cs.DM) and formal languages (cs.FL). Finally, the paper mentions the use of additional working space, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
