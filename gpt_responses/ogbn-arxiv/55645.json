This topic is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG), as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions specific architectures such as VGG-Small and Resnet-18, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) applications. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
