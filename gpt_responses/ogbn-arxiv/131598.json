The paper also proposes an enhancement to the existing approach of using Monte Carlo Tree Search, which involves updating the values at the descendants of the root using the return from the optimal tree path. This enhancement is related to the field of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Data Structures (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses convergence rates for the proposed algorithmic instantiations, which is related to Robotics (cs.RO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
