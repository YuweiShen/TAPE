Additionally, the use of multiple cameras and probabilistic graphical models suggests that it may also be relevant to the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category. The use of deep learning techniques and optimization algorithms suggests that it may also be relevant to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories.
