The proposed model uses sequence models and creates informative dense representations at each time step using signal information. It also models the relationship between different signals and different resolutions in parallel. These characteristics suggest that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), computational linguistics (cs.CL), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
