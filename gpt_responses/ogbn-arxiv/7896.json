The proposed scheme involves the use of queue state information and channel state information to adaptively allocate power to base stations in each cluster. The paper also proposes a distributed online learning algorithm to estimate the potential functions required for power allocation. Given the focus on network MIMO systems, information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) are likely sub-categories. The use of Markov decision processes and game theory suggests that systems and control (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG) are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the use of potential functions and iterative algorithms suggests that mathematical optimization (cs.MA) is a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
