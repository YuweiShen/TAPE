This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of Hamilton-Jacobi reachability, which is a tool commonly used in the field of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) for safety verification. Additionally, the paper discusses the computational complexity of the proposed method, which is a topic commonly studied in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
