The paper also uses deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are commonly used in computer vision tasks (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of ensemble methods, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions scalability, which is a common concern in neural networks and falls under the category of \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE).
