This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) domain. The paper also uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) for encoding, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Additionally, the paper uses pre-trained CNNs for obtaining class-specific activation maps, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Finally, the paper deals with information retrieval (cs.IR) in the sense of encoding videos into fixed-length descriptors for classification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
