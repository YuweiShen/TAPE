The use of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and/or orthogonal multiple access (OMA) to transmit data to multiple users also falls under the purview of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with power allocation for multiple receivers in a downlink scenario, which is a networking problem. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The use of Lyapunov optimization technique to obtain power allocation decisions falls under the purview of systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with power allocation for transmitting data to multiple users, which can be considered as a multimedia problem. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The proposed power allocation schemes entail small complexity based power allocation decisions, which can be considered as a computational problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
