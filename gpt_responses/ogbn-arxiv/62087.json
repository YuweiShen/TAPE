The use of virtual environments for learning and testing these models also involves computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of machine learning algorithms for learning in simulation, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the embodiment of agents and their constraints of physics and space, which is relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
