This falls under the category of Robotics (cs.RO) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The use of a decentralised algorithm and the investigation of different strategies for sharing and exploiting local archives suggest a focus on Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA). Finally, the comparison of results to a well-known distributed evolutionary algorithm suggests a focus on Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
