Extensive form games are a subfield of game theory, which falls under the category of theoretical computer science (cs.THE). However, the paper focuses on developing algorithms and conducting experiments, which suggests that it is more likely to belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), game theory (cs.GT), machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), or systems and control (cs.SY). Among these, cs.GT is the most likely category as it directly relates to game theory, followed by cs.AI and cs.LG as they are also related to developing algorithms for solving games. The paper does not focus on data structures or control systems, so cs.DS and cs.SY are less likely categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
