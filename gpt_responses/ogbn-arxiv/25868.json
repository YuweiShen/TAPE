It also involves deep learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE) as the main tools for optimization. The paper also discusses reinforcement learning (cs.SY) as an alternative approach to deal with the lack of a differentiable channel model. Finally, the paper mentions the use of generative models (cs.MM) to generate channel samples."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
