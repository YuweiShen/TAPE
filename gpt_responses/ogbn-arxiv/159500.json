This topic falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also addresses issues related to latency and time delays in control systems, which could be classified under systems and control (cs.SY). The use of SEAs in robotic systems involves electrical and mechanical engineering aspects, which could be categorized under electrical engineering (cs.ET) and mechanical engineering (cs.ME). Finally, the paper discusses the use of frequency-domain methods and optimization techniques, which could be related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
