The focus on safety-critical applications suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also mentions handling unbounded loops, which is a topic in logic and verification (cs.LO). Finally, the title \"Towards A Compiler For Reals\" suggests a connection to computer architecture (cs.AR) and the implementation of numerical computations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
