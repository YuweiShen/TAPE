This topic is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) as it involves the selection and optimization of features for tracking. The paper also mentions the use of multiple examples and bounding box adaptation, which are common techniques in multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
