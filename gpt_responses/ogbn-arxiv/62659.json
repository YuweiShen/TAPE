It also delves into the neural mechanisms behind proprioception, which involves the study of neural networks (cs.NE). The use of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm for modeling suggests a focus on machine learning and computer vision (cs.CV), while the discussion of receptive fields and tuning curves indicates a focus on statistical learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
