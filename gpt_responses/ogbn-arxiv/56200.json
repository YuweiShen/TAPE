This involves reordering the computation of inference while preserving the original BNN structure and minimizing the memory used for temporaries. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Embedded Systems (cs.EM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
