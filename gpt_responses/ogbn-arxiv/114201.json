It could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as summarization is a common task in IR. The use of graph convolutional networks suggests it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the use of recurrent neural networks suggests it could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
