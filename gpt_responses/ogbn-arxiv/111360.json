The proposed system utilizes techniques such as time-frequency masking, multi-channel coherence, and spatial cues, which are related to signal processing (cs.SD). The use of recurrent neural networks for acoustic and language modeling is a common technique in speech recognition (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of discriminative acoustic modeling and i-vector based acoustic condition modeling, which are related to machine learning (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
