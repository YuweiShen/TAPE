The use of a vocabulary of subgraph-types and the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The experimental results on real graphs, such as Flickr and Notre Dame web graph, suggest a focus on databases (cs.DB) and possibly social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
