The paper proposes a new method for exploration based on the Uncertainty Bellman Equation (UBE), which connects the uncertainty at any time-step to the expected uncertainties at subsequent time-steps. This method is applicable to large systems with complex generalization, which suggests that the paper may belong to categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
