The paper also proposes a new model called the Partial-feedback Model, which involves selecting seeds at intermediate stages, and develops a novel $\\alpha$-greedy policy to solve it. This involves techniques from machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The problem also involves optimization and algorithm design, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of delay in the full-feedback model, which involves control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
