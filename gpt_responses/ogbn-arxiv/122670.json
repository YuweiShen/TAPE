This involves computer vision (CV) techniques such as shape estimation, texture mapping, and feature analysis. The paper also uses graphics (GR) techniques such as rendering and visualization to produce high-fidelity 3D renderings. Additionally, the paper involves multimedia (MM) processing as it deals with images and videos of faces. The use of deep neural networks for feature analysis and texture synthesis also falls under artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
