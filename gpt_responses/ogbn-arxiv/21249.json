The proposed technique involves minwise hashing, which is a popular method in information retrieval (cs.IR) and data mining (cs.DS) for similarity search and dimensionality reduction. The paper also discusses the positive definiteness of matrices, which is a fundamental concept in linear algebra and optimization, and has applications in various subfields of computer science such as databases (cs.DB) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
