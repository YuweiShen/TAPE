The paper discusses the use of tile concentration programming to build exact shapes and scaled shapes, which falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also involves randomized algorithms and computational complexity, which are relevant to the categories of computational complexity (cs.CC) and theoretical computer science (cs.THEORY). The construction of shapes involves geometric considerations, which could be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper deals with the practical limitations of tile concentration programming, which could be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
