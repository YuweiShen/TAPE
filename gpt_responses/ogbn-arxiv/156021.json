This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. The paper also discusses the use of combined loss functions, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) research. Finally, the paper addresses the problem of heart rate estimation, which is a topic in neuroscience (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
