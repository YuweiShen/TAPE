The use of Lafont's soft linear logic and inspiration from recent works on session types as intuitionistic linear logic formulas further supports this. Therefore, categories such as cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.PL (Programming Languages), and cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) are likely. The paper also discusses the existence of polynomial bounds, which suggests a focus on complexity theory and algorithms, making categories such as cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) possible as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
