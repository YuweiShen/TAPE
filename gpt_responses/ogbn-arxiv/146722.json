Therefore, it is likely to belong to the categories of data structures (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), computational complexity (cs.CC), distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC), and social and information networks (cs.SI). Among these categories, cs.DS and cs.IT are the most likely ones, as they directly relate to the main focus of the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
