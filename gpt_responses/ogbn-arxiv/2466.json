It also involves robotics (cs.RO) as the task of grasping and manipulation is mentioned. Machine learning (cs.LG) is also a likely sub-category as the paper mentions the use of attention mechanisms and fusion strategies to learn discriminative multi-modal features. Artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) are also possible sub-categories as the paper deals with the use of multiple modalities to improve object pose estimation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
