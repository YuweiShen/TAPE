This involves analyzing the amount of communication required between two players who each have access to a function, in order to find an approximate fixed point of the composition, concatenation, or interpolation of the functions. This falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC), as well as data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), computational geometry (cs.CG), information theory (cs.IT), and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
