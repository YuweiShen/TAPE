This is a key area of research in social and information networks. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses a Bayesian Theory of Mind approach to formalize inference of social norms. This is a common technique used in artificial intelligence research. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a computational approach to predict how people infer social norms. This is a key area of research in machine learning. \n4. cs.SD (Sound): This category is less likely, but the paper does mention \"hidden causes of behavior\" which could be related to sound-based analysis of behavior. \n5. cs.CY (Cryptography and Security): This category is also less likely, but the paper does deal with how people infer norms in novel social contexts, which could have implications for security and privacy in online social networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
