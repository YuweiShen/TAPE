The paper also discusses the optimization of higher order moments of the cost function, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper presents an algorithm for constructing an affine feedback control law, which is a topic related to robotics (cs.RO). The paper also mentions the use of risk-sensitive policies, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
