Additionally, the use of deep learning architectures for feature extraction and image adjustment prediction is a common technique in computer vision research. The paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories as deep learning is a subset of these fields. Multimedia (cs.MM) and Graphics (cs.GR) are also possible sub-categories as image stylization is a common topic in these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
