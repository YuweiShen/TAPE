This falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI) and specifically, communication and information theory (cs.IT), as well as security and privacy (cs.CR) since safety is a critical concern in vehicular communication. The proposed protocol also involves measuring inter-vehicle distance, which could potentially involve some level of machine learning or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the protocol in terms of key metrics, which could be considered as a system-level analysis (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
