The paper also discusses the problem of scalability in traditional I-POMDPs, which is a common issue in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG) and algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a new approach to modeling agent populations using anonymity and context-specific independence, which could be relevant to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
