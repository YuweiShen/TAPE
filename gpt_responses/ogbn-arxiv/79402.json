This involves using a GAN-based Semi-Adversarial Network (SAN) to modify an input face image such that it can be used for matching purposes but cannot be reliably used by an attribute classifier. The paper also allows a person to choose specific attributes that have to be obfuscated in the input face images. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the paper involves developing a privacy-enhancing method using deep learning techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
