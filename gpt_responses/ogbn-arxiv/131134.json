The paper also discusses the use of feedback in controlling the availability or quality of feedback, which is related to control systems (cs.SY). The paper mentions the use of code trees, which is a common technique in coding theory (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the capacity of coding on the backward link, which is related to multimedia systems (cs.MM).
