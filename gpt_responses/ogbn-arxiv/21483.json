Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the experiments are conducted on image classification datasets (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), indicating that cs.CV (Computer Vision) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also mentions dealing with multimodal functions, which suggests that cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with optimization techniques, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
