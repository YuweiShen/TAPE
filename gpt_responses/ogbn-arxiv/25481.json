The proposed approach involves learning a distance function and using it to guide the search process for generating explicable plans, which involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the implications of inexplicable behavior on human-robot interactions, which is a topic in human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and systems engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the approach involves learning from human evaluations, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
