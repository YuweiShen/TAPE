This involves signal processing, communication theory, and network infrastructure, which are all relevant to the sub-categories of Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), and Systems and Control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of successive interference cancellation receivers, which falls under the sub-category of Multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with cloud radio access networks, which is a topic related to Computer Communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
