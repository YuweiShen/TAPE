This is a key concept in information theory.\n2. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper proposes a novel SM-NOMA system for downlink communication, which is a topic of interest in communication and networking research.\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed SM-NOMA system is a potential solution for improving the efficiency of wireless networks, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper investigates the asymptotic properties of the proposed SM-NOMA system, which is related to system analysis and control.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): Although not the main focus of the paper, the proposed SM-NOMA system could potentially be used for multimedia transmission, which is a topic of interest in the multimedia research community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
