The experiments involve computer vision tasks (cs.CV) and natural language processing tasks (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the use of neural networks (cs.NE) and the development of a soft ordering approach, which involves learning how shared layers are applied in different ways for different tasks, indicating a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
