The paper also emphasizes the importance of efficiency in terms of memory traffic, which is a key concern in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Additionally, the paper proposes a new network architecture, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) and may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
