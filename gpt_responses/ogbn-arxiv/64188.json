Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses different network architectures and loss functions, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions video FR (cs.MM), which is a subfield of multimedia, and cross-age FR (cs.AI), which involves artificial intelligence techniques. Finally, the paper discusses potential deficiencies and future directions, which are related to security and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
