The proposed method also leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which are a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for graph-based data analysis. Additionally, the paper mentions using contextual information to refine object proposals, which is a common theme in natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
