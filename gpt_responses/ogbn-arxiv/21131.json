Additionally, the paper specifically mentions improving inference time for deep networks, which is a common application in computer vision (cs.CV) and augmented reality (cs.AR). Finally, the paper also discusses using domain-knowledge inspired logic, which could potentially fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
