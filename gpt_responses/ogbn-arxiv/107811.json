The paper specifically focuses on multi-objective optimization, unknown feasibility constraints, and categorical/ordinal variables, which are all common requirements in computer systems. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.AR (Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems), followed by cs.SE (Software Engineering), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.PL (Programming Languages), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as these sub-categories are all relevant to the problem of design space exploration in computer systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
