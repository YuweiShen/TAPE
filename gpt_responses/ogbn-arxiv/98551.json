Additionally, the paper also discusses how this idea could be applied more generally to (deep) reinforcement learning, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. The paper also involves optimization techniques, which could place it under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves numerical methods and algorithms, which could place it under the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
