The paper proposes a novel approach to address the limitations of existing face aging methods, which suggests that it is likely to be categorized under cs.CV and cs.LG. The paper also involves the use of facial attribute vectors, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (AI) and multimedia (MM). Finally, the paper involves image processing techniques, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category of information retrieval (IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
