This topic falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). The use of graph tautology formulas and DPLL proofs suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and satisfiability (cs.CR). The mention of pebbling tautologies also suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
