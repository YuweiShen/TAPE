The use of Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. The deployment of DNNs in security-critical domains also indicates the relevance of the paper to the systems and control (cs.SY) category. Finally, the paper presents a new approach for formally checking security properties, which could be of interest to the software engineering (cs.SE) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
