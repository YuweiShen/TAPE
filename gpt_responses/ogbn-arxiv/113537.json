The paper specifically uses the Obstacle Tower Challenge as a benchmark, which involves randomized environments and separate seeds for training, validation, and test runs. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), robotics (cs.RO), and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
