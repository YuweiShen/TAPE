Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach, which involves training the model using pixel correspondences extracted from readily available large-scale SfM reconstructions, without any further annotations. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on various benchmarks for image matching and 3D reconstruction, indicating that it may also be relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
