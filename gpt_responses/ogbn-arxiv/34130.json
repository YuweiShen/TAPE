The use of non-adaptive conditional samples is a specific technique in distribution testing, which falls under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also involves complexity analysis, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper's focus on reducing the problem from $\\ell_1$-testing to $\\ell_\\infty$-testing suggests that it may also fall under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
