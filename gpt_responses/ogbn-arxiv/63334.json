It may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as superpixels are often used in multimedia applications. The paper proposes a new global regularity measure, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper addresses the non-robustness of existing metrics, which suggests that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
