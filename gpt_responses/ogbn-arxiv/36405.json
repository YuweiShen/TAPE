The paper proposes a cutoff-based approach, which is a common technique in algorithm design. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a selection strategy for optimizing the job-to-employee assignment, which can be seen as an AI problem. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper investigates the convergence rates of different selection strategies towards the optimal solution, which is a common topic in machine learning. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper considers changes in the quality score across the population, which can be seen as a network effect. \n5. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper sets a rank-based objective for the selection process, which is a common topic in game theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
