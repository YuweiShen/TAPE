This problem is a common topic in the sub-fields of Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA), Robotics (cs.RO), Distributed Computing (cs.DC), and Distributed Systems (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper proposes an algorithm for solving the Square Formation problem, which involves forming a square pattern, and this algorithm involves computational reasoning, making it relevant to the sub-field of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
