The paper also introduces new weight enumerators for these codes, which falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of finite commutative Frobenius rings and the derivation of MacWilliams type identities suggest a connection to algebraic coding theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to systems and control theory (cs.SI) as it deals with error detection and correction in computer memory systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
