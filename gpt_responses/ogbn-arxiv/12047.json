The paper also presents a derandomized concentration bound for low-degree polynomials, which is a topic in computational complexity theory (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of concentration inequalities and probabilistic techniques also suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
