Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Additionally, the paper involves techniques from machine learning (proximity bounds) and numerical analysis (LP and IP solutions), which make cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) likely sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
