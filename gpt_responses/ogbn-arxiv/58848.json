It also involves machine learning techniques, which makes it relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The use of synthetic data for training object detectors also makes it relevant to the Robotics (cs.RO) category. Finally, the use of image manipulation techniques for data synthesis makes it relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
