Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves supervised learning via deep-learning framework, which suggests the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper involves retrieval of similar objects using ANNOY library, which suggests the sub-category cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
