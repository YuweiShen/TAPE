This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also mentions transmitter resource limited links, which could fall under the categories of signal processing (cs.SI), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
