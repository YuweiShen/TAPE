The paper also presents an efficient algorithm for this framework, which involves finding exploratory policies that visit each significant state with probability proportional to its maximum visitation probability under any possible policy. This algorithm can be instantiated by any black-box approximate planner, such as value iteration or natural policy gradient. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
