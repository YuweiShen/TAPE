Additionally, the use of a neural sequence-to-sequence model suggests a focus on natural language processing. The paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) due to the use of a neural network. Information Retrieval (cs.IR) may also be relevant as the system is designed to generate abstracts based on a given title. Finally, Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) may be relevant due to the use of a neural network in the system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
