Therefore, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses an online control procedure, which involves machine learning and optimization, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also mentions convex costs, which is a topic in optimization and mathematical programming, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a possible sub-category.
