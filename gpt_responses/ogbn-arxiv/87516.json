This involves developing a novel block-coordinate proximal splitting method for the iterative solution of hierarchical sparse coding problems and showing an efficient feed forward architecture derived from its iteration. The paper also discusses the use of different training objective functions to enable learnable sparse encoders to be used as full-featured sparse encoders or even modelers. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
