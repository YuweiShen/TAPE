It may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a post-processing step to refine the pose estimation. Additionally, it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it involves developing a method to improve the accuracy of pose estimation. The graphics (cs.GR) sub-category is also a possibility as it deals with the fine details around body parts. Finally, the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category may be relevant as it involves processing and analyzing images."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
