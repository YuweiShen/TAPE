The applications mentioned in the abstract, such as numerical solving of partial differential equations and representation of surfaces in graphics, suggest that the paper could also belong to the sub-category of computer graphics (cs.GR). The use of Riemannian metrics and Voronoi diagrams suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the sub-category of numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the theoretical aspects of the discrete Riemannian Voronoi diagram, which could make it relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the experimental companion paper mentioned in the abstract suggests that the paper could also belong to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI), as it may involve analyzing and visualizing data related to networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
