It also involves the use of residual knowledge incorporation scheme, which is a common technique in machine learning. Additionally, the paper also touches upon the use of deep learning models such as LSTM, which falls under the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). \n\nThe paper also involves the use of data-driven techniques for solving real-world problems such as traffic flow prediction, which falls under the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Furthermore, the paper also discusses the use of expert knowledge, which is a common theme in the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence).
