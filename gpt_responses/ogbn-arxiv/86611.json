This falls under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of temporal logic properties and assertion checkers, which are commonly used in software engineering (cs.SE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions user validation in experiments, which falls under the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category.
