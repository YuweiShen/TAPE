The paper proposes a novel network architecture for pedestrian detection, which involves joint learning of pedestrian detection and extra features. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the subcategories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves experiments with pedestrian benchmarks, which suggests that it may also fall under the subcategories of robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
