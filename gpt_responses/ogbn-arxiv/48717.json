The approach is evaluated on two popular image classification datasets, Omniglot and miniImageNet, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also involves learning transferable prior knowledge across tasks, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as normalization, which suggests that it may also belong to the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of neural networks, which is a common theme in the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
