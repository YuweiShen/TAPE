This work is related to the field of machine learning, specifically in the area of GNNs, which is covered by the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with the processing of signals on irregular structures modeled by graphs, which is related to the cs.SI (Signal Processing) sub-category. The use of graphons to preserve the spectral properties of the graph is also related to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The experiments conducted in the paper involve the evaluation of the proposed strategy in terms of overfitting and dimensionality reduction, which are related to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
