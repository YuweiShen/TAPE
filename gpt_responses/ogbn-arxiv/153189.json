This is a core topic in information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with wireless networks and proposes a new strategy for communication between users. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with communication between users in a network, which is a topic of interest in social and information networks.\n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper proposes a new coding scheme based on nested lattices, which involves computational complexity. This is a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - Although not directly related to multimedia, the paper deals with communication between users in a wireless network, which can involve multimedia data.
