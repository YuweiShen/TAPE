The paper also discusses the use of embedding-projection pairs (ep pairs) for proving graduality, which is a topic that falls under the software engineering (cs.SE) and type theory (cs.TYPES) sub-categories. Finally, the paper touches on the interpretation of type dynamism, which is a concept related to subtyping and falls under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
