It could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as answer selection is a sub-task of information retrieval. Additionally, the use of transfer learning techniques and deep learning models make it likely to belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the use of attention mechanisms and memory networks suggest that it could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
