It also involves security and cryptography (cs.CR), as well as network protocols and architectures (cs.NI). The use of MIMO systems suggests a focus on signal processing and control (cs.SY), while the consideration of auto-regressive models implies a focus on machine learning and data analysis (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
