The paper also discusses eavesdropping and secure communication, which are relevant to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The proposed schemes involve cooperation among nodes and relays, which can be seen as a form of distributed control and optimization, making the paper relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses beamforming techniques, which are commonly used in signal processing and communication systems, making the paper relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
