This is a classic topic in game theory, and hence cs.GT is the most likely sub-category. \n2. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): Although the paper does not explicitly mention neural or evolutionary computing, the study of selfish dynamics and equilibria in distributed service systems can be seen as a form of optimization or learning problem, which falls under the purview of cs.NE. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with interactions among agents in a distributed system, which can be seen as a form of social network. Moreover, the study of congestion and frustration phenomena in such systems is relevant to the study of social networks, where similar phenomena are observed. \n4. cs.DS (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper deals with distributed service systems, which are a form of distributed computing. Moreover, the study of equilibria in such systems is relevant to the study of distributed computing, where similar problems arise. \n5. cs.PF (Performance): The paper deals with the performance of distributed service systems, specifically in terms of congestion and frustration phenomena.
