The paper proposes a trainable decoding algorithm using a variant of deterministic policy gradient, which involves training an actor to manipulate the hidden state of the neural machine translation decoder. This approach involves machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning and optimization, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for machine translation, which is a subfield of computer vision (cs.CV) that has been applied to NLP tasks. Finally, the paper uses empirical evaluation to compare the proposed algorithm to existing decoding algorithms, which involves experimentation and statistical analysis, falling under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
