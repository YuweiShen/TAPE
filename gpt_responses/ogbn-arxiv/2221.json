The focus on beamforming structures and energy efficiency suggests that it could also be classified under systems and control (cs.SY). The use of millimeter wave frequencies and MIMO systems suggests that it could also be classified under multimedia (cs.MM) and architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
