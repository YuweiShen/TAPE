The use of Gaussian mixture sources and additive white Gaussian noise suggests that the paper may belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.SP (Signal Processing). The focus on different error metrics and the use of the Wiener filter suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the mention of linear mixing systems suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
