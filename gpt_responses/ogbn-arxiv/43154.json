The paper focuses on the macroscopic structure of tags applied by users to annotate and catalog questions, and develops a simple generative model that creates random bipartite graphs of tags and questions. The paper's findings and model have implications for understanding user behavior and knowledge curation on the Web. Based on this description, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), followed by cs.SOC (Social and Information Networks), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.DL (Digital Libraries), and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
