The use of nonparametric Gaussian process priors to generalize across the state and action spaces is a popular approach in the field of reinforcement learning, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) and symmetric psd kernels, which are common tools in machine learning and optimization, and are often studied in the context of kernel methods (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the adaptive control of parametric linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, which is a topic studied in the field of control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents sublinear regret bounds, which are a common performance metric in online learning and optimization, and are studied in the fields of machine learning (cs.MA) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
