The focus on improving the performance of the simulation models and analyzing the spatial covariance of the channel realizations suggests a systems and control (cs.SY) perspective. The use of matrix structures and efficient computation methods may also relate to mathematical aspects (cs.MA) of the work. Overall, the paper could fit into multiple sub-categories, but cs.IT and cs.NI seem to be the most relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
