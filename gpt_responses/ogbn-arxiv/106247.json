It could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it proposes new methods for pre-training neural models. Additionally, it could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves the use of neural networks for language generation. It may also be relevant to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as headline generation is often used in search engines.
