The use of shortest vector problems (SVPs) and basis expansion also suggests a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also proposes improvements to existing algorithms, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
