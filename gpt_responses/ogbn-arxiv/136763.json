This falls under the domain of programming languages research. \n- cs.AR (Architecture): The paper focuses on generating efficient code for modern hardware architectures such as multicores, GPUs, FPGAs, and distributed clusters. This involves understanding the underlying hardware architecture and optimizing code accordingly, which falls under the domain of computer architecture research. \n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper evaluates Tiramisu by creating a new middle-end for the Halide and Julia compilers, which are both mathematical software packages. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the mathematical software community. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the ability of Tiramisu to target distributed clusters with both CPUs and GPUs. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the distributed computing community. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses how Tiramisu simplifies optimization and makes targeting multiple hardware architectures from the same algorithm easier. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the software engineering community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
