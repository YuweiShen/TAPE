The analysis of experimental data and the development of a quantum model also suggest a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the consideration of consequences on applied disciplines, such as quantum computation, suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
