This involves the use of computer vision techniques (cs.CV) to process the light fields, as well as graph theory (cs.GR) to construct the local graphs. The paper also discusses a coding scheme to assess the rate-distortion performances of the proposed transforms, which involves multimedia (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper proposes a novel transform optimization method that aims at preserving angular correlation even when the shapes of the super-pixels are not isometric, which involves computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
