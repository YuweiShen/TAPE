This involves adaptive, dynamic representation learning, which combines offline pre-training with online selection and modification of embedding functions. The paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computational linguistics (cs.CL), computer vision (cs.CV), and computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
