These techniques are commonly used in database systems (cs.DB) and information retrieval (cs.IR) to optimize query performance. The paper also emphasizes the importance of flexible visual specifications and user-adjustable granularities, which are relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the paper mentions the computational complexity of the proposed approach, which is related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
