This involves the use of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automatically extract and summarize hyperlocal information about events, topics, people, and places from these Twitter posts. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which deal with the analysis and retrieval of information from social media platforms. \n\nThe paper also discusses the user interface and user study, which suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and cybernetics (cs.CY). Additionally, the use of natural language processing and machine learning techniques for event detection and summarization aligns with the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
