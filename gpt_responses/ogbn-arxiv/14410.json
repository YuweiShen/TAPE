Additionally, the paper mentions the use of LVCSR, which is a technique used in speech recognition, another area of overlap with NLP.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new loss function for training a model, which is a core component of machine learning. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of semi-supervised learning, which is a subfield of machine learning.\n- cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper involves processing audio signals, which falls under the scope of the cs.SI sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed approach involves training a model to detect parts and whole of a keyword, which is a task that falls under the scope of artificial intelligence.
