The paper also discusses the software design and integration of sensors, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the real-time hardware platform and controller for communication with actuators, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses lessons learned and encourages faster setup of such systems by other research groups, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and knowledge transfer."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
