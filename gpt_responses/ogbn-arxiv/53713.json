The paper focuses on the development of a hierarchical neural network that can learn motion selectivity in an unsupervised manner. The paper employs convolutional layers for feature extraction and local motion perception, and a fully-connected layer for global motion selectivity. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper introduces a novel adaptive neuron model and stable spike-timing-dependent plasticity formulation, which are relevant to the sub-categories of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the emergence of motion selectivity in an unsupervised manner, which is relevant to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper validates the proposed solution using synthetic and real event sequences, which is relevant to the sub-category of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
