It also discusses the problem of generalization, which is a common issue in natural language processing (cs.CL). The proposed model is a multi-task learning approach, which involves training a neural network to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, a topic that falls under machine learning (cs.LG). The model also uses a decoding mechanism to re-rank captions, which is a technique commonly used in natural language generation (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the evaluation of the model's performance, which involves measuring the similarity between generated captions and ground truth captions, a topic related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
