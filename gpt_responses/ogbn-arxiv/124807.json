The paper also proposes a new model architecture to improve the performance of existing object detection models, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of neural networks also suggests the possibility of the paper being categorized under neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the speed of the proposed model, which could also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
