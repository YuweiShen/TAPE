It also considers the integration of social relationships among users, which falls under the category of social networks (cs.SOC). The paper proposes novel algorithmic approaches to solve networked bandit problems, which involves designing and analyzing algorithms (cs.AI). The paper also deals with clustering of graph nodes, which involves data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets, which involves statistical inference and machine learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
