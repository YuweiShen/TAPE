This is a problem that falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of joint channel-and-data estimation, which is a topic in statistical inference (cs.ST) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with the design of efficient systems, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
