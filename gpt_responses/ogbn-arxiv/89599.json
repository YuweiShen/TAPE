The construction method involves designing the structure of each additional parity bit through density evolution, which is a common technique in coding theory and falls under the coding and information theory (cs.CC) sub-category. The paper also discusses the performance of the codes in simulations, which involves analyzing the behavior of communication networks and falls under the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper mentions the need to avoid undesired graphical structures in the protograph design, which is a topic in graph theory and falls under the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
