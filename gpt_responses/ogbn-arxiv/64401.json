This falls under the intersection of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The proposed method involves learning from weak labels, which is a common problem in machine learning and can be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG). The use of attention mechanisms and embeddings also suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
