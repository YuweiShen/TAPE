The paper focuses on developing a new spatial convolution operation that models the key properties of local connectivity and translation invariance using high-order connection patterns or motifs. The proposed architecture, Motif-CNN, employs an attention model to combine the features extracted from multiple patterns, thus effectively capturing high-order structural and feature information. The experiments conducted on real-world social networks and multiple representative heterogeneous graph datasets indicate significant gains over existing graph CNNs and other state-of-the-art techniques. Given the focus on deep learning and graph analysis, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
