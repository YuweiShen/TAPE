The paper proposes a new method to enforce invariance to intra-category variations in the standard equivariant loss. This involves exchanging descriptor vectors between images of different object instances prior to matching them geometrically. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. \n\nThe paper also proposes a method to learn vectors that can simultaneously be interpreted as local descriptors and dense landmarks, which involves combining the advantages of both. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. \n\nThe paper uses a geometric matching approach to evaluate the proposed method, which involves optimizing a neural network to predict geometric transformations between pairs of images. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on standard benchmarks, which suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. \n\nTherefore, the 5 likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper, ordered from most to least likely, are: cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE, cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
