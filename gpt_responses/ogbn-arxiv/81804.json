It also discusses the complexity of the sphere decoding algorithm, which is a computational problem (cs.CC). The use of the complexity exponent to describe the computational reserves required by the SD algorithm is a statistical inference problem (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the diversity multiplexing tradeoff (DMT), which is a topic in network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of a specific type of code, the threaded cyclic division algebra (CDA) based codes, which is a topic in algebraic coding theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
