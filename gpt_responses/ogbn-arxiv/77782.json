This approach is based on linear classification using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features and exploits both simple pooling and sparse linear fusion schemes. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves some statistical analysis and validation experiments, which could place it in the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.MS) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
