The paper also proposes a new algorithm to compute extensive-form correlated equilibria, which involves optimization techniques (cs.AI). The benchmarks proposed in the paper are designed to evaluate the performance of algorithms for solving extensive-form games, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the behavior of extensive-form correlated equilibria in different scenarios, which is a topic of interest in multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
