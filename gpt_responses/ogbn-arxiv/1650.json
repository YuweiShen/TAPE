The paper also mentions the use of custom algorithms and procedures for estimating source locations and signal propagation, which suggests a focus on algorithm development. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.SI (Signal Processing), cs.SD (Sound), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
