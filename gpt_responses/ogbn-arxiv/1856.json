It uses two-variable Oregonator equations, a model widely accepted and verified in laboratory experiments, to study the propagation of excitation wave fronts for a range of excitability parameters. The results of the paper will be used in future studies of studying dynamics of cities and characterizing the geometry of street networks. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) as the paper deals with the dynamics of cities and street networks. The other likely sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) as the paper involves the use of unconventional computing devices, wet electronic devices, and neuromorphic prototypes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
