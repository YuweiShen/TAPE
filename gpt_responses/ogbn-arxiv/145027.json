The most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it is the most general category for this topic. The paper also discusses heuristics and exact inference approaches, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data mining (cs.DM). The paper also deals with the problem of scalability, which is relevant to distributed systems (cs.DS) and computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
