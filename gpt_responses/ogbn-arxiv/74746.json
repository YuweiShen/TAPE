The use of linear length and read-$k$ oblivious branching programs suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the construction of pseudorandom generators can also be relevant to software engineering (cs.SE) for ensuring the security and reliability of software systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
