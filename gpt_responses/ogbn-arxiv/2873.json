The paper specifically focuses on the behavior of weights in weight space during training. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision), as these sub-categories are directly related to the topic of the paper. Additionally, the paper discusses the non-convexity of error surfaces, which is a common topic in the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
