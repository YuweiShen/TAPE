The paper also discusses the computation of equilibria, which is a topic commonly studied in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper's focus on security games and the impact of observability on utility suggests that it could also be classified under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper's study of solution concepts and their properties suggests that it could also be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
