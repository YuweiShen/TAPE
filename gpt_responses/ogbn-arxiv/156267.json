The use of approximate message passing (AMP) and density estimation approaches also suggests a possible fit with the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on universal denoising and ergodic signals could also make it relevant to the Statistical Learning (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
