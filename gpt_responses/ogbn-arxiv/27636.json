The paper also introduces a large-scale multi-modal HR database (cs.MM) and discusses the impact of less-constrained scenarios on HR estimation, which relates to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the proposed approach uses a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for efficient HR measurement, which is a type of neural network commonly used in natural language processing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
