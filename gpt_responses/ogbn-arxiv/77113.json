Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves robotics (RO) and machine learning (LG) techniques, which are closely related to the topic. Additionally, the paper proposes a learning-based approach using deep learning (AI) and conducts experimental validations (GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
