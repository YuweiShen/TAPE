The proposed method involves using channel-wise convolutions to replace dense connections among feature maps with sparse ones in CNNs. This technique is particularly relevant to computer vision (CV) tasks, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.CV sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves training and optimizing neural networks, which could fall under the cs.LG (machine learning) sub-category. The use of CNNs also suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.AI (artificial intelligence) sub-category. The paper's focus on reducing the number of parameters and computational cost of CNNs could also place it in the cs.NE (neural and evolutionary computing) sub-category. Finally, the experimental results involve image classification, which could fall under the cs.MM (multimedia) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
