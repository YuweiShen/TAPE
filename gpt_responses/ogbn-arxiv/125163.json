The use of branch and bound techniques and domain-specific pruning rules also suggests that it could be relevant to the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper mentions the potential for application in truth maintenance, which could place it in the programming languages (cs.PL) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
