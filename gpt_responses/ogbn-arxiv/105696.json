Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel training strategy and auxiliary class for background suppression, which involves learning from video-level action labels. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on two popular benchmarks, which suggests that it may also belong to the category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
