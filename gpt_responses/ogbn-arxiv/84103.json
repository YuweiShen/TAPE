The paper also focuses on the performance of ANNs on image datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10, which suggests Computer Vision (cs.CV) as another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of regularization techniques to binarize network weights, which is a common technique in Neural Networks (cs.NE) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the power consumption and efficiency of the FPGA-accelerated networks, which could also fall under the sub-category of Emerging Technologies (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
