This is a sub-category of cs.NE.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - The paper evaluates the proposed methods on image classification datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. This suggests that the paper is related to computer vision and pattern recognition, which is a sub-category of cs.CV.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a deep spiking neural network model and a novel hybrid neural coding scheme, which are related to machine learning. This is a sub-category of cs.LG.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes a method for improving the efficiency and accuracy of spiking neural networks, which are a type of artificial intelligence. This is a sub-category of cs.AI.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the transmission of information between neurons in spiking neural networks, which can be considered a control problem.
