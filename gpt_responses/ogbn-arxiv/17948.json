The proposed method involves training deep neural networks with dynamic weights, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of bio-markers, which suggests a potential overlap with artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The stochastic training scheme and decoupling of the segmentation process also involve optimization techniques, which could fall under neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper reports state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets, which suggests a potential overlap with multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
