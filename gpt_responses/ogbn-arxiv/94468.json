The focus is on robotic manipulation, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The method involves data-driven techniques for mapping raw signals from pressure sensors to known surface locations and indentation depths, which involves machine learning (cs.CV, cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of a finite-element model for improving the placement of pressure sensors, which involves computational methods (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for deploying tactile sensing capabilities over 3-D surfaces such as a robotic finger or palm, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
