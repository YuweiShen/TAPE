The use of probability density functions and functionals suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The development of data-driven basis functions and the use of empirical estimates suggest that the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) or Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. Finally, the evaluation of the methodology using empirical estimates of tight bounds suggests that the paper may also belong to the Statistics (cs.ST) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
