This falls under the networking and internet architecture sub-category. \n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper mentions the use of invisible image sensor communication technology in the proposed prototype. This technology can be used for information retrieval, which falls under the information retrieval sub-category. \n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - The paper discusses the use of digital signage, which involves displaying visual content. Computer vision and pattern recognition techniques can be used to analyze and optimize the visual content displayed on the signage. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes an SDN scheme for the smart digital signage system, which involves controlling physical devices and data transmission. This falls under the systems and control sub-category. \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper mentions the use of invisible communication technology, which involves transmitting data through the air using light. This falls under the information theory sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
