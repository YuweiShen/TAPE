The specific scenario of unlicensed use of TV bands also falls under the category of communication and networking (cs.CR). The development of a sub-space algorithm for signal detection involves system control and optimization (cs.SY). Finally, the use of wireless microphones in TV white space has implications for multimedia systems and applications (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
