The proposed approach uses a deep neural network architecture, which falls under machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG) subcategories. The paper also discusses the security implications of contact lens detection in biometric authentication systems, which relates to the subfield of cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper involves image processing techniques for iris images, which is a subfield of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
