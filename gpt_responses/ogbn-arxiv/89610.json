The use of ordinal preferences and the study of how much information is needed for good approximation also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The design of algorithms and the analysis of their performance involves data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of ordinal preferences and the study of approximation algorithms can also be seen as a topic in social choice theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
