It uses a batch reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the optimal charging policy and analyzes its performance using simulation experiments based on real-world EV charging data. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
