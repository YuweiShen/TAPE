The use of phase shifters and switching networks also suggests that the paper may be relevant to the field of computer architecture (cs.AR). Finally, the paper specifically mentions millimeter wave communications, which is a topic of interest in the field of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
