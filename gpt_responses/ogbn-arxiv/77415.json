The paper deals with Visual Question Answering (VQA), which involves processing multi-modal inputs and combining visual and natural language processing with abstract reasoning. This makes it a problem that is considered AI-complete. The paper focuses on using high-level, abstract facts extracted from the inputs to facilitate reasoning, which is a common approach in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. Finally, the paper uses object detection (cs.CV) and reasoning modules (cs.AI, cs.RO) to achieve its results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
