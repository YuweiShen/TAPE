The use of algebraic techniques and parameterized complexity also suggests a possible connection to algebraic algorithms (cs.SC) and theoretical computer science (cs.IT). However, the focus on specific problem instances and parameterized above-average formulations makes these categories less likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
