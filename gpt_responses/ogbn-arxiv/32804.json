This involves computer vision and machine learning techniques, which are covered in the computer science sub-categories of computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as it deals with predicting object distributions from above, and natural language processing (cs.CL) may also be relevant as the paper discusses interpreting images without manual annotations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
