The paper proposes a semi-supervised framework that utilizes density estimation to detect real drift in partially labeled streaming environments. This work involves machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, data science, and neural networks, which are all subcategories of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
