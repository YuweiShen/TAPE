Additionally, the paper explores the use of small neural networks to learn the activation functions, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of activation functions is also relevant in computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
