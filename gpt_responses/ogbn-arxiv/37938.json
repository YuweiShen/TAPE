The paper also discusses the lack of human-level performance on randomly corrupted images, which is related to the broader field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the security implications of adversarial examples, which is related to computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes methods for improving adversarial robustness, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
