The method is applied to training logistic regression and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the use of an adaptive version of ADAM, which is a popular optimization algorithm in deep learning, and thus could also be relevant to the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
