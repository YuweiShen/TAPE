The paper also proposes a deep learning framework for this task, which involves training with noisy annotations and online fine-tuning, indicating a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of Internet data and query keywords suggests a possible connection to information retrieval (cs.IR), while the pixel-level prediction task aligns with multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
