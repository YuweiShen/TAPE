The proposed approach involves the integration of the Cuckoo search (CS) algorithm, which is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm commonly used in computer science (CS) research. The paper also discusses the use of singular value decomposition (SVD), which is a mathematical technique used in information theory (IT) and artificial intelligence (AI) research. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV, cs.MM, cs.CR, cs.IT, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
