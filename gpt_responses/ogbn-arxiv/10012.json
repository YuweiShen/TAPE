The use of a predetermined grid of beams and user equipment reporting their preferred beams is related to system design and optimization (cs.SY), while the use of uplink pilots is related to signal processing (cs.COM). Finally, the use of Massive MIMO technology itself falls under the category of multimedia communication (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
