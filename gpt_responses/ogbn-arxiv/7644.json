The paper uses synthetic features to study the influence of temporal persistence on biometric identification and analyzes two datasets based on eye-movements and gait. This work involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques for biometric identification and classification. It also involves aspects of computer security (cs.CR) and multimedia (cs.MM) for biometric data analysis. Information retrieval (cs.IR) may also be relevant for the analysis of similarity score distributions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
