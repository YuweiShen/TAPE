Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses different encoding and pooling methods, which are related to machine learning and data mining, respectively. Hence, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.MM (Multimedia) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions feature fusion methods, which are related to information retrieval and artificial intelligence. Therefore, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
