Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a new approach that addresses the scalability issue of current learned MVS methods, which involves optimization and algorithmic aspects, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a likely sub-category as well. Additionally, the paper applies the proposed method to large-scale scenarios, which involves robotics (cs.RO) and computer graphics (cs.GR), making them less likely but still possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
