The method considers a video as a 1D sequence of clips, each associated with its own semantics. The paper describes matching methods for forming correspondences between clips of reference videos and test videos, and transferring reference semantics to the test video. The paper applies the method to various video analysis tasks, including video captioning, video summarization, temporal action detection, and sound prediction. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), followed by cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
