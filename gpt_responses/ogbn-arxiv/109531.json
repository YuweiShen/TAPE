The paper also presents a strategy improvement algorithm for computing the value of a concurrent safety game, which involves the use of mathematical logic and formal methods (cs.LO). The algorithm involves the computation of probabilities, which suggests a connection to probability theory and stochastic processes (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of value iteration algorithms and strategy improvement algorithms, which are commonly used in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with the computation of upper and lower bounds for the values of concurrent reachability and safety games, which involves the use of mathematical programming and optimization techniques (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
