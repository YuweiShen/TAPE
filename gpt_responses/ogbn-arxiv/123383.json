This sub-category is highly relevant to the paper.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the complexity of decision problems and presents algorithms for solving them. This sub-category is also highly relevant to the paper.\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): Although the paper does not explicitly deal with computational geometry, it is closely related to graph theory, which is a subfield of computational geometry. Therefore, this sub-category is a likely match.\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper does not explicitly deal with game theory, but it does discuss decision problems related to graphs, which can be applied to game theory. Therefore, this sub-category is a possible match.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper deals with the complexity of decision problems and presents results on their computational complexity.
