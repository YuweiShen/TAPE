The use of a continuous model and resolution-independent formulation suggests a focus on mathematical and computational methods (cs.MM). The paper also proposes a fast conversion method, which could be seen as an application of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or machine learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
