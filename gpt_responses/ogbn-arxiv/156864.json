This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) since the autonomous driving systems are implemented using deep neural networks. The paper also discusses the systematic exploration of the state space, which is related to control systems (cs.SY) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the use of a game engine for simulation and visualization may also fall under computer graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
