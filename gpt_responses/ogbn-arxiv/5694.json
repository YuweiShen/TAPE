The paper also mentions the use of ORGaNICs in sensory processing and motor control, which could fall under the sub-categories of computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO), but these are less likely given the focus on working memory. Finally, the paper uses machine learning techniques and discusses the advantages of ORGaNICs over other types of LSTMs, which could fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
