The codes are also applicable in authentication codes and data storage systems, which fall under the categories of cryptography (cs.CR) and data structures (cs.DS), respectively. The paper also mentions the use of linear codes in secret sharing schemes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the use of Gauss sums, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
