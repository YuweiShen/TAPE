The paper also mentions the use of semi-join based preprocessing, which is a technique commonly used in distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of Spark's relational interface for executing SPARQL queries, which falls under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
