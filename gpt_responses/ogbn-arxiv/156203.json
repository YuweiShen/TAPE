The use of OMP algorithm for sparse signal recovery is a common topic in these sub-categories, and the paper's focus on the robustness of OMPMMV under noise is relevant to all of them. However, since the paper's main result is derived from a theoretical analysis of the algorithm's performance, cs.IT and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
