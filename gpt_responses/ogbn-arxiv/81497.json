The paper also focuses on the functional approximation perspective of learning, which is related to the field of numerical analysis and optimization, and could potentially fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.IT (Information Theory). The use of ReLU activation functions and the study of the evolution of network prediction errors suggest a focus on deep learning, which could also place the paper under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
