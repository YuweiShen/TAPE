This involves using a curriculum learning mechanism to focus on achievable tasks first, which provides robustness to catastrophic forgetting and distracting tasks. The paper also discusses the benefits of having two levels of parameterization for learning skills in modular environments. Based on these topics, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also touches on topics related to control systems (cs.SY) and computer vision (cs.CV), which are less likely but still relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
