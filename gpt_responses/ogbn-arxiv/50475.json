The algorithms also exploit the structure of the problems to remove symmetries and reduce workload, which involves techniques from distributed computing (cs.DC) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the algorithms using machine learning techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
