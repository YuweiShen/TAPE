The paper also introduces a notion of connection pattern chain, which is related to network topology and routing, making it relevant to computer networks (cs.NI) and social networks (cs.SI). The paper also uses linear interference alignment (IA) techniques, which are commonly used in wireless communication and signal processing (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the DoF of G-cell MIMO-IBC, which is a type of cellular network, making it relevant to computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
