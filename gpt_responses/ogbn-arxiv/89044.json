The paper also compares the code constructions with classical error correction coding schemes, which is related to the sub-category of computer communications (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper discusses the trade-offs between performance and decoding complexity, which is related to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
