The paper specifically focuses on mixture-of-experts layers, which are a key component of gated networks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions numerical experiments involving computer vision and natural language processing tasks, suggesting that cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
