The use of probability and stochastic optimization techniques suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The mention of sensor footprint and coordination of multiple robots suggests a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
