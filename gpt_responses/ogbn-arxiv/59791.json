The paper also mentions the complexity theory and the P vs NP problem, which are topics that fall under the categories of information theory (cs.IT), computational complexity (cs.CC), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of experiments to verify academic conclusions, which is a topic that falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG).
