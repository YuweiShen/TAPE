The paper also proposes a novel method for pruning with limited data, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of residual connections is also a key aspect of the paper, which is a popular technique in neural networks (cs.NE) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
