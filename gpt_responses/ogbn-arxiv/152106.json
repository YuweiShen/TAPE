Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves a subjective quality assessment study, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of crowdsourcing for data collection suggests a possible category of cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also proposes a new full-reference quality assessment method, which could fall under the category of information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the use of Thurstone's model for reconstructing absolute quality scale values suggests a possible category of graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
