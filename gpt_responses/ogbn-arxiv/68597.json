The use of sphere decoding and the LLL reduction algorithm are also common techniques in these fields. Additionally, the paper involves analyzing the computational complexity of these algorithms, which is a topic studied in computer science theory (cs.DM) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the success probability of the Babai point, which is a statistical measure and could be relevant to the statistical inference (cs.SI) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
