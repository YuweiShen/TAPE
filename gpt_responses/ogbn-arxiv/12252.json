The paper proposes a novel poisoning method that attacks several machine learning algorithms used in IDSs, which involves the application of machine learning techniques such as pattern detection and classification, indicating the relevance of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on synthetic and real network datasets, which suggests the relevance of data mining and information retrieval (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
