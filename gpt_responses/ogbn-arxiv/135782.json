The cipher is software-oriented, which suggests that it may also be relevant to computer engineering (cs.CE) and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also mentions the efficiency of the cipher, which could relate to information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses the security of the cipher, which could be relevant to cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
