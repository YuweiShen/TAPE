The paper's focus on audiovisual-based emotion recognition makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Inception(v2)-LSTM network trained on image-like maps, which are built based on short-term acoustic feature sequences. This suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.CV sub-category.\n- cs.SD (Sound): The paper's focus on audio signals and the use of an SVM classifier trained on holistic acoustic feature vectors and one LSTM network trained on short-term feature sequences extracted from segmented audio clips makes it a likely candidate for the cs.SD sub-category.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with emotion recognition, which is a natural language processing (NLP) task. While the paper does not explicitly mention NLP, the use of RNNs trained on facial images suggests that it could belong to the cs.CL sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses multiple deep models, including CNNs, RNNs, SVM classifiers, and LSTMs, which suggests that it could"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
