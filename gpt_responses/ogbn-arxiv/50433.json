The focus on approximation guarantees suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfields of approximation algorithms (cs.DS) and online algorithms (cs.LG). Finally, the use of Bayesian priors and the study of combinatorial auctions suggest a connection to the subfield of mechanism design (cs.EC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
