The use of probabilistic signal models and the EM algorithm for likelihood maximization suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The mention of space-time outputs and array responses suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of Multimedia (cs.MM) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
