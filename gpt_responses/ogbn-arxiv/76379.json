The proposed method involves using periodic vectors to represent the orientation of objects, which is a technique that falls under machine learning (cs.AI) and statistical learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses a novel IoU calculation method for long objects, which is related to robotics (cs.RO) and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
