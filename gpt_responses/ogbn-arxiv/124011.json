The paper also employs machine learning techniques to learn representations of multiword expressions, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of external knowledge in the form of sememes is also a common approach in information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language understanding (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
