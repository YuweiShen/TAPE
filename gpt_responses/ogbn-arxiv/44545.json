The task of generating outlines for multi-paragraph documents involves understanding the content and structure of the text, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed model is a neural generation model, which falls under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of attention mechanisms and Markov dependencies, which are common techniques in deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
