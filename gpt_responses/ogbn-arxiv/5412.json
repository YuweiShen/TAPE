The paper also discusses algorithmic techniques and their performance, which are relevant to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category. The paper also mentions the decoding of multiple-input multiple-output systems, which falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes practical variants of embedding decoding, which may involve machine learning techniques, and hence may be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
