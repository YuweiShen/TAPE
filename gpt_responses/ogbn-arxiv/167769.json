The paper also discusses the optimality of the algorithm, which is related to lower bounds in computational complexity (cs.DM). The problem of morphing planar graphs is a classic problem in graph drawing (cs.GR), and the paper's focus on improving the upper bound for morphing steps and proving optimality fits within this sub-category. Finally, the paper's use of algorithms and computational techniques to solve a problem in graph drawing and geometry also makes it relevant to the sub-category of computational science (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
