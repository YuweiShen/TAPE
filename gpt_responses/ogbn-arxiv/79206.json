The use of graphical models to represent conditional independences also suggests a possible fit with the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) category. The paper also discusses the construction of a directed expected utility network to support decision making, which could be relevant to the social and information sciences (cs.SI) and computational engineering (cs.CE) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
