The approach involves predicting future obstacle positions and motion, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI). The paper also mentions using computer vision techniques for obstacle detection (cs.CV). The trajectory optimization algorithm mentioned in the paper involves control systems and system engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the paper uses probabilistic methods for collision detection, which is a common topic in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
