This falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also introduces the concept of Voronoi-like diagrams, which are simpler to compute and serve as intermediate structures. This could potentially fall under data structures (cs.DS) or discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the robustness of the Voronoi-like diagrams under insertion operations, which could fall under graph theory (cs.GR) or social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
