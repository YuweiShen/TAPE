Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SC (Symbolic Computation and Computer Algebra). The paper also mentions the reduction of output size and computation time, which suggests that it may belong to cs.CG (Computational Geometry) or cs.GR (Graphics) as well. Additionally, the use of CAD in investigating semi-algebraic sets suggests that it may belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
