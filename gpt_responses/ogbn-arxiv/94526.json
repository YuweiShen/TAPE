The paper also mentions the use of LSTM, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with decision making among multiple agents, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of observations, which could involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
