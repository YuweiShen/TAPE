Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CG (Computational Geometry). Additionally, the paper uses techniques from parameterized complexity, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The problem of finding area-universal rectangular layouts also has connections to graph theory and combinatorics, which could place the paper in cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) or cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
