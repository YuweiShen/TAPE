It also involves training models on large-scale data and evaluating them through online experiments. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as recommender systems are often used in information retrieval applications. \n\nAdditionally, it could be categorized under cs.CL (Computation and Language) as it involves natural language processing for app descriptions and user feedback. \n\nIt may also fall under cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the paper mentions using images as input features for the recommender system. \n\nFinally, it could be classified under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves developing a system that can learn from data and make recommendations based on user behavior."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
