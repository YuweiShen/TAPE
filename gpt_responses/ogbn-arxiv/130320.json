The proposed framework involves active querying for demonstration during training, which suggests a focus on optimization and control. The paper also introduces a novel query strategy that adapts to dynamically-changing distributions, which suggests a focus on machine learning and deep learning. The empirical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods across four different tasks, which suggests a focus on experimental evaluation. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics and Control). The paper also involves computer vision (cs.CV) and systems and control (cs.SY) aspects, which are less prominent but still relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
