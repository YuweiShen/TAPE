Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses video encoding techniques such as scalable video coding (SVC) and dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH), which fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). The use of stochastic geometry to derive tractable expressions for successful transmission probability suggests the involvement of information theory (cs.IT). The optimization problem discussed in the paper involves multiple variables and constraints, which is a typical problem in distributed computing (cs.DC) and systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
