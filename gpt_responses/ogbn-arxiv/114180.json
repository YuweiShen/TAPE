This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category covers research on the design, analysis, and implementation of efficient data structures and algorithms for various computational problems. The paper's focus on designing a parallel algorithm with good scalability and low memory consumption for constructing a compact representation of planar embeddings fits well within this sub-category. \n\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): This sub-category covers research on the development and analysis of algorithms and data structures for solving geometric problems, such as those involving points, lines, curves, surfaces, and volumes. The paper's focus on planar embeddings and compact representations suggests that it may be relevant to this sub-category as well. \n\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): This sub-category covers research on the design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms and systems for distributed, parallel, and cluster computing. The paper's focus on designing a parallel algorithm with good scalability suggests that it may be relevant to this sub-category as well. \n\n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): This sub-category covers research on the mathematical foundations of computer science, including combinator"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
