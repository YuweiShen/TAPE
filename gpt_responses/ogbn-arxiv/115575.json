The algorithmic techniques used in the paper involve space complexity and constructions of equivalent transducers, which are topics in data structures (cs.DS) and logic (cs.LO). The paper also involves complexity analysis, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC), and information theory (cs.IT) is relevant for the study of transductions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
