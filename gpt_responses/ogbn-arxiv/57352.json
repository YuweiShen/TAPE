This is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and logic (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the use of propagators and solvers, which are commonly used in constraint programming (cs.PL) and optimization (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the use of a lazy conflict-driven learning algorithm, which is a common technique in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
