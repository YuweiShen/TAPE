It proposes a method to include cryptographic operations into existing approaches for automated app analysis and provides a computational soundness result for Dalvik bytecode. \n2. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a method to include cryptographic operations into existing app analysis tools using minor changes in their semantics. It also discusses the limitations of existing approaches for understanding an app's behavior. \n3. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses how cryptographic operations can be expressed as symbolic abstractions within the comprehensive Dalvik bytecode language. It also proposes a method to add these abstractions to existing app analysis tools. \n4. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper provides a computational soundness result for Dalvik bytecode, which can be seen as a logical property of the language. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method to analyze the behavior of Android applications that rely on cryptographic operations, which can be seen as a control problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
