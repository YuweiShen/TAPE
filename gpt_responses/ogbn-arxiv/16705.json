Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.GR (Graphics) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves graph matching algorithms, which falls under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper mentions the generation of space filling curves, which is related to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
