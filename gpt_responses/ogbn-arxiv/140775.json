The paper also discusses linear transformations and linear-feedback shift registers, which are topics related to information theory (cs.IT) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also proposes combinations of linear transformations and scramblers that can be implemented efficiently on superscalar processors or directly in hardware, which is a topic related to software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
