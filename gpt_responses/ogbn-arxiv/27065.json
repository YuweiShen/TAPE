The paper also discusses the trade-off between cacheability, overhead, and loss in model accuracy, which is a common concern in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper proposes a cache design that exploits temporal locality in input video streams, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and augmented reality (cs.AR). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the cache on off-the-shelf mobile devices, which is related to system design (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
