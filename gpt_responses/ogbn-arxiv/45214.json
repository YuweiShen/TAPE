The algorithm also involves heuristically guided search, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the scalability and efficiency of the algorithm, which are important topics in programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
