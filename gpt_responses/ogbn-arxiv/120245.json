The use of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and sequence-to-sequence learning also suggests the sub-category of structured inference (cs.SI). The focus on multichannel speech enhancement further narrows down the sub-categories to those related to audio and speech processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
