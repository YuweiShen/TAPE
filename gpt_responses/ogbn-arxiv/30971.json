Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of neural networks, which falls under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and the proposed technique involves multi-task learning, which is related to cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
