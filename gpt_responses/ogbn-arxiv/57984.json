The use of time series pooling to capture short-term/long-term changes in feature descriptor elements suggests a possible connection to machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also experiments with different feature representations, indicating a possible connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
