This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper deals with multi-user massive MIMO systems, which can be considered as a type of multi-agent system. The use of TR-MRC and CFO estimation techniques also involves coordination among multiple agents (base station antennas).\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the performance of a receiver in a wireless communication system, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n4. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper proposes a new CFO estimation technique based on the spatially averaged periodogram, which involves signal processing techniques.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with a wireless communication system that can transmit multimedia data, which falls under the scope of multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
