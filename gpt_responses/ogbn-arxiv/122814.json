The paper discusses the formulation of model interpretation as approximating a target classifier using a simpler interpretable model, such as rule models like a decision set/list/tree. This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of synthetic instances and active learning for model interpretation, which could fall under natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV) as these fields often use active learning for data labeling. Finally, the paper discusses the technical contribution of an algorithm for learning a decision set, which could fall under cryptography and security (cs.CR) as decision sets are often used in security applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
