It also involves networking (NI) as IoT systems connect devices over a network. The paper also discusses the use of Fog and Cloud computing (DC) for testing IoT systems. The testing methods also involve system analysis and prediction (SY) based on usage profiles. Finally, the paper proposes a framework for testing IoT layers, which involves data structures and algorithms (DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
