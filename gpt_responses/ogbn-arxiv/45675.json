The paper also discusses applications such as graph visualization, link prediction, and anomaly detection, which are related to \"cs.SI\" (Social and Information Networks) and \"cs.SD\" (Software Engineering). The paper deals with the problem of handling growing dynamic graphs, which is a topic in \"cs.DS\" (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper uses experimental results to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which is a common practice in \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
