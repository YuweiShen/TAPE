The paper also discusses the use of deep learning models, which falls under the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The paper proposes a novel approach to integrating deep learning models with compositional models, which involves clustering and mixtures of models, which are topics that fall under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-categories.
