This suggests that the paper could belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) or machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the representation of root structures as points in a tree-shape space, which suggests that it could also belong to the graph theory (cs.GR) or computational geometry (cs.CG) sub-categories.
