This topic is closely related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, which are covered by the cs.LG and cs.AI sub-categories. Additionally, the use of SOMs suggests a neural network approach, which falls under the cs.NE sub-category. The paper also mentions the high number of dimensions in the datasets, which is a common issue in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
