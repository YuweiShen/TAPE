This problem is relevant to several practical applications, such as reachability analyses, geomarketing, and visualizing the cruising range of a vehicle. The paper presents several speedup techniques for computing isochrones on large, realistic inputs, which are based on previous approaches for one-to-many shortest path computation and similar scenarios. These techniques involve Multilevel Dijkstra techniques, graph partitions, and PHAST. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.DB (Databases), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
