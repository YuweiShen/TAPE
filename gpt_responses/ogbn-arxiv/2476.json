This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of surveillance videos to evaluate the models, which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as another possible sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the movement of multiple agents, which could fall under robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper mentions the use of diverse training data to improve model performance, which could fall under social and information sciences (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
