The paper also involves machine learning techniques for user tracking, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.LG). Finally, the proposed defenses involve signal obfuscation and geo-fencing, which could fall under social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
