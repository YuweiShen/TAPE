Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the transmission, processing, and utilization of information. The paper also discusses the use of deep learning algorithms, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) a likely category as well. Additionally, the paper involves network infrastructure and communication systems, which could fall under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper specifically mentions millimeter wave systems, which could also place it under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
