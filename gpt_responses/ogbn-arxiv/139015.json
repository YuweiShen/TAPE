This falls under the domain of programming languages. \n2. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper gives semantic and axiomatic characterizations of isomorphic session types, which involves a non-standard notion of equivalence between processes. This is related to the domain of logic in computer science. \n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the use of behavioral types for searching component libraries, which is a software engineering problem. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper mentions the order of messages and branching points in component types, which is related to the design of data structures and algorithms for communication protocols. \n5. cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper discusses the axiomatization of isomorphic session types, which is related to the domain of formal languages and automata theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
