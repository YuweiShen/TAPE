Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the computation of minimal bases for interpolation modules, which is a topic in algebraic geometry and algebraic coding theory, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also mentions the comparison of the algorithm's complexity with other decoding methods, which falls under cs.SI (Systems and Control) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
