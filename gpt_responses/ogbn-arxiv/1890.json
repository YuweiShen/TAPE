The regularizer is based on the evidence of a network prediction defined as the firing of neurons in specific paths. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computational linguistics (cs.CL). However, since the paper focuses on image and video recognition benchmarks, the first three sub-categories are more likely to be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
