It also discusses potential games and Hamiltonian games, which are subtopics of game theory (cs.GT). The paper proposes a new algorithm for finding stable fixed points in general games, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses conservation laws, which is a topic in control theory (cs.SY).
