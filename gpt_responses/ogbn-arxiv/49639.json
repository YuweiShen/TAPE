This suggests that the paper could fall under the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) category. Additionally, the tool uses computer vision techniques to analyze video data, which could place it under the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) category. The paper also mentions the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze the data, which could place it under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. Finally, the paper discusses the potential for large-scale studies, which could place it under the Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
