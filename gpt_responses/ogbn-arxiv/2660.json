It also involves compression of correlated sources, which is a common problem in multimedia applications (cs.MM). The use of real-number codes and the focus on low-delay communications suggest a possible fit with signal processing and communication systems (cs.SI). The paper also describes encoding and decoding procedures, which are typical of coding theory (cs.DC). Finally, the use of mean-squared reconstruction error (MSE) as a performance metric is related to machine learning and statistical inference (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
