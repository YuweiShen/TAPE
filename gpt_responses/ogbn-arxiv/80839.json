The paper also discusses optimization techniques and finite element methods, which are relevant to the systems and control (SY) subfield. The paper uses mathematical models and algorithms to plan comfortable and customizable motion, which is related to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (LG). Finally, the paper mentions the use of computer vision (CV) for obstacle detection and avoidance, which is another relevant subfield."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
