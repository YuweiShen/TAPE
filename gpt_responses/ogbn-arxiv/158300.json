It may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves developing a framework for an integrated relation extraction system. Additionally, it may fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) as the paper discusses the use of word embeddings and training data expansion to improve the relation extraction systems.
