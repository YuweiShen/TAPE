This makes cs.CR the most likely category for this paper.\n2. cs.DB (Databases): The paper deals with location data collected by various service providers and proposes solutions for sharing this data without compromising privacy. This makes cs.DB a likely category for this paper.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the impact of achieving differential privacy on the utility of the proposed protocols. This makes cs.LG a possible category for this paper.\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper addresses privacy and legal concerns related to sharing location data and proposes solutions that protect user privacy. This makes cs.CY a possible category for this paper.\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with location data collected by various service providers and proposes solutions for sharing this data without compromising privacy.
