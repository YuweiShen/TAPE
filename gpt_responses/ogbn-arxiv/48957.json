The authors also mention the need for memory-efficient models, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper proposes a new framework for optimizing neural network performance, which could fall under the category of neural engineering (cs.NE) or computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
