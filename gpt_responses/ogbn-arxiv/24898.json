This suggests that the paper could belong to the computational geometry (cs.CG) or discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the computational complexity of finding an optimum sequence of shifts, which falls under the computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-category. The paper also mentions bounds on the obfuscation complexity of planar graphs, which could be of interest to researchers in the graph theory (cs.DS) and graph algorithms (cs.GT) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
