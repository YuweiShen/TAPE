The focus is on rectification-based methods, which involve transforming the image to a canonical form before recognition. This involves techniques such as perspective correction, which is a common topic in image processing (cs.IR). The paper also discusses various tricks and techniques for improving the performance of the recognition system, which could fall under the categories of natural language processing (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
