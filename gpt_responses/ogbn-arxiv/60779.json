The algorithm is based on the observation of contact deformation patterns of hyperelastic materials, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The proposed method uses the Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition (HHD) algorithm, which is a mathematical technique commonly used in machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the algorithm is integrated into a closed-loop adaptive grasp force control framework, which involves control systems and robotics (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
