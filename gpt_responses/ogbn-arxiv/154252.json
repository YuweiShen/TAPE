Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel deep learning architecture, which involves multi-scale features and geometry context, indicating that it may belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as well. Additionally, the application of disparity prediction is relevant to robotics and autonomous driving, suggesting that it may also belong to cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
