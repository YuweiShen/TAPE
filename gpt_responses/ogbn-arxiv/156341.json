This is a networking problem. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper considers the problem of minimizing the total power at the relay subject to individual SINR constraints using linear and non-linear precoding strategies. This is a control problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses beamforming strategies for broadcasting data in a multi-user network, which is relevant to multimedia applications. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper uses numerical simulations to illustrate the results, which involves computational methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
