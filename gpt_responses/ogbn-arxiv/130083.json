Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with the intersection of computer science and linguistics. The paper also uses external sources from the web, which suggests a possible fit with cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The use of deep neural networks and LSTM text encoding suggests a possible fit with cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the evaluation of the proposed framework, which suggests a possible fit with cs.CY (Computers and Society) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
