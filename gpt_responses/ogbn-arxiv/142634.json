The paper focuses on optimizing the active and passive beamforming at the access point and the IRS, respectively, to maximize the total received signal power at the user. This problem falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) as it deals with the optimization of the signal transmission and reception. It also falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) as it deals with the design of a wireless network. The paper also involves the optimization of a system with multiple components, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper involves simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
