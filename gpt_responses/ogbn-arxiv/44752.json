This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also leverages recent work on cyclic learning rate schedules, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the experiments involve classification tasks, which falls under the category of natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
