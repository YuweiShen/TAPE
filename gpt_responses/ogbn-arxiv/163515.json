Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the construction of codebooks with small inner-product correlation, which is a topic related to cryptography and security, making cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) another likely category. The paper also mentions compressed sensing, which falls under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Signal and Image Processing). Finally, the paper discusses optimal codebooks, which is a topic related to coding theory, making cs.CC (Computational Complexity) a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
