The paper also discusses the use of unitary matrix representations of Clifford Algebra to obtain weight matrices for the STBC, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the ergodic capacity of the proposed design, which is a topic in network information theory (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the complexity of maximum likelihood (ML) decoding, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper presents simulation results, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
