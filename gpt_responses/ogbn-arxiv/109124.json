This involves techniques from artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and residual learning. The paper also evaluates the proposed method on a series of datasets constructed from real-world KGs, which involves techniques from databases (DB) and information retrieval (IR). Additionally, the paper compares the proposed method to state-of-the-art embedding-based EA methods, which involves techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics (CL). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.DB, cs.CL, and cs.IR, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
