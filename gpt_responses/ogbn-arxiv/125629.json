The paper specifically focuses on image classification (cs.CV) and object detection (also cs.CV). The proposed method involves a selection procedure and adaptive precision levels, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper also mentions the computational efficiency of the method, which is a topic that falls under data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
