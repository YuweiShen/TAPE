These topics are typically covered in the Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), and Signal Processing (cs.SP) sub-categories of arXiv CS. Additionally, the paper mentions applications such as Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings, randomized sketches, and blind demodulation, which are also commonly studied in these sub-categories. Therefore, it is likely that the paper belongs to one or more of these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
