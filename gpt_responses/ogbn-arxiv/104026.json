This is a key problem in networking and internet architecture, making cs.NI the most likely category. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the use of advanced receivers at the base-station, which promise further gains in spectral efficiency. This involves the use of coding and decoding techniques, which are central to information theory. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with scheduling multiple users over a shared wireless channel, which is a problem that arises in social and information networks. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the use of transmit antenna selection in the LTE uplink, which can improve the quality of multimedia transmissions. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes several algorithms for resource allocation and user pre-selection, making cs.DS a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
