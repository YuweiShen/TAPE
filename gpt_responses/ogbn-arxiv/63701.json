The paper discusses DXNN's architecture, mutation operators, and its built-in feature selection method that allows for the evolved systems to expand and incorporate new sensors and actuators. The paper also compares DXNN to other state of the art TWEANNs on the standard double pole balancing benchmark and demonstrates its superior ability to evolve highly compact solutions faster than its competitors. Additionally, the paper demonstrates the platform's ability to create NN populations with exceptionally high diversity profiles and its applicability to the domain of robotics, artificial life, and coevolution. Based on these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
