The techniques used in the paper involve matrix analysis and union bounds, which are common tools in theoretical computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). The paper also involves numerical analysis and optimization, which suggest the sub-categories cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
