This involves incorporating semantic information into visual representations, which is a common theme in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of deep learning models for zero-shot learning and inferencing also falls under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper involves the use of a new dataset, which could potentially fall under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
