The use of orthonormal bases and finite harmonic analysis suggests a connection to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the application of the results to the Heisenberg dictionary of chirp like functions suggests a possible connection to statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
