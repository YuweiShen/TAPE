Specifically, it focuses on the 3SUM problem and its variants, which are classic problems in computational geometry and have been extensively studied in the literature. The paper presents new deterministic and randomized algorithms for these problems, which are based on advanced techniques from data structures, algebraic geometry, and probabilistic analysis. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
