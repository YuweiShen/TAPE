The use of cyclic codes is a common technique in coding theory, which is a subfield of cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also involves the study of minimum distances and code lengths, which are topics in discrete mathematics (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper specifically mentions the construction of optimal codes, which is a topic in coding theory and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
