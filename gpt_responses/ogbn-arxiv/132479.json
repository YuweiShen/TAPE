Additionally, the paper introduces higher-order features to the original port-graph syntax, which is related to programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the implementation of the matching algorithm, which is a key aspect of software engineering (cs.SE). Furthermore, the paper deals with the dynamics of systems modelling, which is related to the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with proof-net reduction systems, which is a topic that falls under the category of symbolic computation (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
