The paper also discusses the impact of hybrid beam-forming on the sum DoF of interference channels, which is a topic related to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper presents an achievable scheme optimized for the hybrid beam-forming structure, which is a topic related to computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
