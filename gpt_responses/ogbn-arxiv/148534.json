The paper also discusses MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems, which are a key area of research in communication engineering. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.COMM (Communication), and cs.SI (Signal Processing). Additionally, the paper mentions lattice designs and system models, which are relevant to the fields of computer science and data science, leading to the inclusion of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
