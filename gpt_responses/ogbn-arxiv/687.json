This involves using pre-trained object detectors and focusing on regions that are important/relevant to the conditioned actor. Given this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) are also possible categories given the focus on video analysis and feature extraction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
