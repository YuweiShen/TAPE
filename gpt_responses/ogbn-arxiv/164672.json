The focus on space complexity suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Data Mining (cs.DM) sub-category. The use of the Massive Parallel Computation (MPC) model and the mention of classic PRAM algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category.
