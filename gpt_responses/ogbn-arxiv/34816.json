Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with time-varying channels, which is a characteristic of wireless networks, making cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) another likely category. The use of deep reinforcement learning also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper proposes a scheme for optimizing the IA user selection policy, which can be considered as a control problem, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) another possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
