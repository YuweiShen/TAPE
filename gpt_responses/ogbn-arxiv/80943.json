The concept of physical layer security also falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of OFDMA technology and power allocation strategies are related to multimedia systems (cs.MM). Finally, the optimization problem and algorithms used in the paper fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
