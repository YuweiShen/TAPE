Based on the abstract, the paper focuses on the sample complexity of estimating the policy gradient for nearly deterministic dynamical systems. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG), robotics (cs.RO), control systems (cs.SY), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
