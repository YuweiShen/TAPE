Therefore, cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of heuristics and automation, which are topics that fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also applies the prover to formalization projects in mathematics and computer science, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper mentions the implementation of the prover in Isabelle/HOL, which is a proof assistant, and proof assistants fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
