The paper also discusses probabilistic criteria of efficiency, which is related to probability theory and statistics (cs.ST). Additionally, the paper mentions label-conditional conformal prediction, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses an idealized setting, which could be related to theoretical computer science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
