The paper also discusses runtime errors and divergence, which could fall under type theory (cs.TL) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the properties of gradual languages, which could fall under formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
