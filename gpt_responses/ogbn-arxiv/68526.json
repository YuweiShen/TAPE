The paper also discusses the use of a cost function, which is a common topic in computational complexity (cs.CC) and data mining (cs.DM). Finally, the paper presents a new data structure, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG) who are interested in efficient data structures for processing large datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
