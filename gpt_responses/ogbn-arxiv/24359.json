The use of AI to bypass the need for expert labeling also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). The application of this technology to medical imaging and the use of OCTA and motion artifacts suggest a potential fit for the medical imaging (cs.MED) and robotics (cs.ROB) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
