The paper proposes a method for obtaining deformation factors with local support, which is a novel approach. The method involves matrix factorization with sparsity and graph-based regularization terms. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper deals with shape-based interpolation and segmentation, which are common problems in computer vision. \n- cs.GR (Graphics): The paper deals with 3D shape deformations, which is a common problem in computer graphics. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a method for matrix factorization with sparsity and graph-based regularization terms, which is a machine learning problem. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel approach for representing 3D shape deformations, which is an AI problem. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper does not explicitly mention neural networks or evolutionary algorithms, but the proposed method involves matrix factorization, which is a common technique in neural networks and evolutionary algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
