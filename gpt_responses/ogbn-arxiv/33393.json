The paper also focuses on the use of commercial off-the-shelf processors, which falls under the category of computer systems and networking (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the development of new techniques for using reduced precision to improve the quality of computed results, which could be considered a topic in scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
