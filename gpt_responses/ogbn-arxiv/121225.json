The approach involves the use of a deep convolutional network (DCN), which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The scoring mechanism for facial parts responses is carefully formulated, which involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI). The proposed method achieves outstanding performance on various face detection benchmarks, which are commonly used in multimedia research (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the practical runtime speed of the proposed method, which is an important consideration in neural network optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
