The paper proposes a stochastic approximation algorithm based on the cross entropy method to solve the modified control problem. The paper also provides experimental results to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. The paper's focus on reinforcement learning, optimization, and control suggests that the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
