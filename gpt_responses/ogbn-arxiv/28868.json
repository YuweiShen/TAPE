The paper proposes a new probabilistic generative model framework for reinforcement learning and develops a new probabilistic graphical model for Markov decision processes. These topics are closely related to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
