The specific problem of top-$k$ dominating queries involves ranking points based on a multi-criteria decision making system, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or information retrieval (cs.IR). However, the paper's focus on designing algorithms for semi-dynamic and fully dynamic scenarios suggests a strong emphasis on data structures (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB). Additionally, the use of asymptotic guarantees implies a theoretical computer science (cs.CC) component."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
