The use of message passing algorithms is also a common technique in both sub-categories. The paper also mentions the applicability of the algorithm to settings where sensors distort measurements in ways other than multiplication by a gain, which falls under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Signal Processing (cs.SP) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses numerical simulations, which is a common technique in the Statistical Learning (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
