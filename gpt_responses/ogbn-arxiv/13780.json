The authors propose a method for constructing a coarsened abstraction of a given market, which is a common technique in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). They also use techniques from matrix completion, which is a subfield of machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The paper involves analyzing and bounding important quantities such as regret, envy, Nash social welfare, Pareto optimality, and maximin share, which are topics in decision theory and optimization (cs.DS). Finally, the paper is concerned with market design and optimization, which is a subfield of economics and computer science (cs.EC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
