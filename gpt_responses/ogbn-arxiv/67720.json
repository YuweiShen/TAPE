The paper also introduces and discusses the class of computational problems denoted by $\\exists\\mathbb{R}$, which involves solving systems of polynomial inequalities over the reals, and the paper establishes $\\exists\\mathbb{R}$-completeness of several problems, which falls under the categories of algorithms and complexity (cs.DS, cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also presents a decision algorithm for the first-order theory of the reals, which is related to logic and foundations of mathematics (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
