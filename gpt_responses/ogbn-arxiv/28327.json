Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the impact of speech recognition errors on machine comprehension, which falls under the category of machine learning (ML). Therefore, cs.SD (Sound) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories.
