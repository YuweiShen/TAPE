The paper proposes an unsupervised approach to paraphrasing, which involves learning from an unlabeled monolingual corpus only, making it relevant to sub-categories such as Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). The paper also evaluates its approach on tasks such as paraphrase identification and generation, which are relevant to Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
