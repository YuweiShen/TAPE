Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the implications of the main result on the design of CSIT feedback schemes for multi-carrier multi-antenna wireless networks, which falls under the scope of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper uses techniques from signal processing and optimization, which are relevant to cs.SI (Signal Processing) and cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) region, which is a fundamental concept in communication theory, and the Minkowski sum, which is a geometric operation, both of which are relevant to cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
