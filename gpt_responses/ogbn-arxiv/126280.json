The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for entity resolution, which involves feature engineering and training data creation, indicating the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The paper also discusses the use of distributed representation-based approaches, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL).
