The paper specifically mentions text-based search and visualisation of all papers in arXiv, which suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper mentions enhanced search and ranking facilities, which could be related to deep learning (cs.DL) and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques. Finally, the exploration of arXiv papers through a novel user interface could also involve machine learning (cs.LG) methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
