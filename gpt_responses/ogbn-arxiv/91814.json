The paper presents distributed algorithms for computing local mixing time, which is a useful parameter for designing efficient algorithms for partial information spreading, gossip, etc. This makes the paper relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). Among these, cs.DS and cs.SI are the most likely categories, as the paper deals with graph algorithms and network analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
