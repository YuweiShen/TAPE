The paper also discusses the tractability of probability computation, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of decision diagrams and circuit treewidth is also related to the study of graph algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and circuit complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
