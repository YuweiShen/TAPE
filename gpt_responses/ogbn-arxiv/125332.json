The paper also discusses the success of residual networks, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks such as image classification. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper discusses the expressivity of residual networks, which falls under the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper also experiments with convolutional layers, which is a common technique in natural language processing, falling under the sub-category of cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
