Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also presents a library-based solution for app developers, which suggests it could also fit into cs.SE (Software Engineering). The implementation of mandatory access control and the evaluation of performance could place it in cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.PL (Programming Languages). Finally, the use of open source apps for evaluation could also suggest cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
