The paper specifically focuses on low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, which are a type of error correction code commonly used in classical computing (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of entangled states (ebits) in quantum error correction, which is a topic in quantum information theory (cs.QUANT) and quantum computing (cs.ET). Finally, the paper studies the spectrum of attainable code parameters, which is a topic in systems theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
