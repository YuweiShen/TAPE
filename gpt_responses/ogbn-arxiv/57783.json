The approach involves combining two physics models to generate a hybrid model, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also uses a model-predictive-control framework based on trajectory optimization, which is a topic related to control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper presents experiments in simulation and on a real robotic setup, which are topics related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
