This involves techniques for processing communications as observations, predicting future observations during execution, and representing only certain useful monitoring hypotheses to allow for scalability. These techniques are evaluated empirically in monitoring a deployed team of agents engaged in complex, dynamic task execution. Given the focus on multi-agent systems, plan recognition, and monitoring, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI and cs.MA. However, the paper also addresses issues of scalability and human-computer interaction, which suggest additional possible sub-categories of cs.HC, cs.LG, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
