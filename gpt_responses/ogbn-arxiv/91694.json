The use of computer vision techniques for object following suggests that the paper may also fall under computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed approach involves Bayesian fusion, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of local statistics and global voting suggests that the paper may also fall under systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the use of machine learning techniques for fusion suggests that the paper may also fall under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
