The paper proposes a model to analyze the number of citations of a publication, which is relevant to the sub-categories of digital libraries (cs.DL), information retrieval (cs.IR), and social and information networks (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the random factors that affect the number of citations, which is relevant to the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR) and cybernetics (cs.CY).
