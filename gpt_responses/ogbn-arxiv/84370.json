This involves learning the probability distribution underlying the latent representations through an autoregressive procedure. The paper also discusses the use of a maximum likelihood objective to minimize the differential entropy of the distribution spanned by latent vectors. Given these aspects, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a framework that involves training a deep autoencoder and a density estimator to detect novelties. This is a machine learning problem, and hence, the paper is likely to belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper discusses the use of the proposed framework for video anomaly detection, which is a computer vision problem. Hence, the paper is likely to belong to this sub-category as well. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a framework that involves learning the probability distribution underlying the latent representations through an autoregressive procedure. This is a common technique used in artificial intelligence, and hence, the paper is likely to belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper involves training a deep autoencoder, which is a neural network architecture. Hence, the paper is likely to belong to this sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
