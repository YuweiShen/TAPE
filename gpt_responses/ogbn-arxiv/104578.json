The authors also discuss the implications of their work for Wikipedia administrators and the broader community. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper uses machine learning approaches to classify users as vandals or non-vandals based on their editing patterns and other features. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper analyzes the behavior of Wikipedia users and identifies specific patterns that distinguish between vandals and non-vandals. The authors also discuss the role of social networks in detecting and preventing vandalism. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper uses natural language processing techniques to extract features from Wikipedia user profiles and edit histories. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper addresses the problem of detecting vandals on Wikipedia, which is a security issue for the platform and its users. The authors also discuss the limitations of existing vandalism detection systems and propose a new approach that outperforms them."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
