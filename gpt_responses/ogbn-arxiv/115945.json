Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new mechanism called Inverted Attention, which involves modifying the attention mechanism in the detector network. This suggests that the paper could also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper mentions that the proposed approach requires no extra training or testing overheads, which could be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
