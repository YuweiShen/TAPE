This involves translating labeled images from a source to a target domain in an unsupervised manner and learning a re-ID model using the translated images. The paper proposes a similarity preserving generative adversarial network (SPGAN) and its end-to-end trainable version (eSPGAN) to preserve the underlying human identity information after image translation. This work involves computer vision (CV) techniques such as image translation and re-ID model learning, and machine learning (ML) techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and end-to-end training. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper deals with large-scale person re-ID datasets, it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
