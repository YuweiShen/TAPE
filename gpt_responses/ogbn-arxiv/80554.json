The paper also establishes the problems' complexity classes, which are important in complexity theory. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The paper also involves the study of Boolean formulas, which are related to data structures (cs.DS) and logic (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper deals with the complexity of decision problems, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
