The development of an annotation scheme for high-level narrative structures also involves the use of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to identify patterns and extract information. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of computational approaches to support complex communication with humans, which could fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
