Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques such as TF/IDF, TextRank, and Glove Vectors, which are commonly used in information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (LG). Hence, cs.IR and cs.LG are also likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of pre-trained vectors and weighing techniques, which are common in artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks (NE). Therefore, cs.AI and cs.NE are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
