The paper also introduces a new way of measuring the quality of spanners using the $\\ell_p$-norm of their degree vector. This makes the paper relevant to several subfields of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), computational geometry (cs.CG), numerical analysis (cs.NA), social and information networks (cs.SI), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Among these, cs.DS and cs.CG are the most likely categories, as the paper deals with the design and analysis of algorithms for graph spanners."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
