It proposes a method for explaining decisions and determining feature importance for invertible networks. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
