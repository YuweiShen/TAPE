The proposed method involves a pattern set-based approach, which suggests the use of data structures and algorithms commonly used in data science and machine learning, such as data structures for efficient pattern matching (cs.DS), databases for storing and querying transaction data (cs.DB), and artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques for identifying patterns and anomalies (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments, which suggests the use of statistical and machine learning techniques for evaluating the performance of the method (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
