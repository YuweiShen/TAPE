Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also utilizes object detection and instance center prediction, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The method involves processing images in real-time, which could fall under robotics (cs.RO) or multimedia (cs.MM) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
