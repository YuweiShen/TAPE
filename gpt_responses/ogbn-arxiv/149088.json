Therefore, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions using 2-stream motion and appearance based segmentation networks, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
