The use of local search to approximately maximize the PAV score suggests a focus on algorithmic techniques, which is also a common theme in cs.AI and cs.DS. The concept of cohesive groups of voters is relevant to both cs.LG (learning theory) and cs.SI (social and information networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
