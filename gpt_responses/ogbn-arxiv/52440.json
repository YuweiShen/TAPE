The paper proposes a new approach for NMT that uses a language-independent representor to replace the language-specific encoder and decoder. This approach involves weight sharing and multi-task learning, which are common techniques used in machine learning and deep learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper involves neural networks, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a possible sub-category. Finally, since the paper evaluates its approach on translation tasks, which involve image captioning, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
