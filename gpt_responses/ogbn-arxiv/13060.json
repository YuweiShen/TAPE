The paper focuses on the expressivity and efficiency of the proposed model and demonstrates its performance on several tabular datasets. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
