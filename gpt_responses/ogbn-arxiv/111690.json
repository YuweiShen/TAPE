This involves the use of novel ordered trends in voltage magnitude fluctuations at node groups, which suggests a focus on system identification and control (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with the computational complexity of the designed algorithms, which suggests a focus on networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper validates the performance of the algorithms using both linearized and non-linear ac power flow samples in test distribution grids, which suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
