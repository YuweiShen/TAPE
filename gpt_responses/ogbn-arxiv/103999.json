The use of natural language processing to generate these explanations also falls under the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper specifically focuses on image classification tasks, which is a sub-field of computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed method involves analyzing missing evidence in an image, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning for feature selection and dimensionality reduction (cs.LG). Finally, the paper also proposes automatic metrics for evaluating the generated explanations, which falls under the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
