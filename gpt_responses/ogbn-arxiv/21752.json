Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of deep learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL) methods. Additionally, the paper evaluates the framework with an empirical study on human perception (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
