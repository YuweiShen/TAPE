The paper also mentions insights from Kolmogorov's complexity theory, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed paradigm involves separate system parts, which could be related to neural networks (cs.NE) or machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper cites evidence from human attention vision studies, which is a topic related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
