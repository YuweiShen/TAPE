The proposed method involves modeling relational context and paths, which are common techniques in graph-based machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also uses knowledge graphs as its main data source, which is a topic related to databases (cs.DB). The method involves message passing, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL) and graph-based machine learning (cs.LG).
