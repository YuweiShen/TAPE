It also involves learning a safety threshold for a risk metric, which is a common topic in machine learning. Additionally, the paper may also fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Robotics (cs.RO) categories as it deals with autonomous driving tasks and learning from human experts. Computer Vision (cs.CV) may also be a relevant category as the paper involves processing visual input from the driving task. Finally, Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) may be a possible category as the paper discusses the challenges of using human experts in interactive imitation learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
