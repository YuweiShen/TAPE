The use of forward error correction to reduce in-order delivery delay is a technique commonly used in multimedia systems (cs.MM) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the need to ensure delay constraints are met is a concern in systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
