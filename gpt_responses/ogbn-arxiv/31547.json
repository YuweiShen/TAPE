This task involves understanding the internal structure of tables, which is a key step in making machines understand tables. The paper also introduces a new dataset for evaluating the task, which contains 15,000 tables from scientific papers. Given these factors, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by information retrieval (cs.IR), natural language processing (cs.CL), deep learning (cs.DL), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
