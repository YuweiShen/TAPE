The paper also discusses methods for visual-semantic embedding and domain adaptation, which are topics commonly studied in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions self-paced learning, which is a technique used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM).
