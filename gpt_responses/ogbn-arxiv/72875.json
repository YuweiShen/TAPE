Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category as it deals with natural language processing. The paper also discusses question answering and browsing, which are related to information retrieval, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another likely sub-category. The use of knowledge graphs and background knowledge suggests cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DB (Databases) as possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach for complex question answering, which involves machine learning, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
