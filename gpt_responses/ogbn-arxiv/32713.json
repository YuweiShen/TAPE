The paper also discusses the ethical and responsible application of machine learning, which is a common theme in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The study involves human-computer interaction and user performance, which is relevant to the human-computer interaction (cs.HCI) sub-category. The paper also proposes a method for evaluating the effectiveness of interpretation, which is related to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category.
