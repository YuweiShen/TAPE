This problem is closely related to data structures and algorithms for efficient processing of large datasets, which falls under the category of \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS). The paper also involves information theory and probability, as it deals with approximating quantiles with a certain level of error and probability, which falls under \"Information Theory\" (cs.IT). The paper proposes a novel representation and modification of a widely used construction, which involves analyzing the space complexity of the resulting sketch, and this falls under \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG) and \"Databases\" (cs.DB). Finally, the paper involves analyzing the lower bound of the sketch size, which falls under \"Computational Complexity\" (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
