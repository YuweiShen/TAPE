The use of language priors from semantic word embeddings suggests a connection to natural language processing (cs.CL). The proposed model also involves training visual models for objects and predicates individually, which could fall under machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG). Finally, the paper mentions improving content-based image retrieval, which could relate to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
