The paper provides bounds on the error rate of a learner with access to a history of independent samples labeled according to a target concept that can change on each round. This problem is closely related to the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, information theory, and statistics. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
