Specifically, the paper focuses on the worst-case optimality of submodular extensions for various models, which suggests a focus on optimization and theoretical analysis. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
