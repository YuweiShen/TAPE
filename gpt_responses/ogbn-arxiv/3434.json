Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also involves probabilistic validation and robust optimization, which are topics related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. Additionally, the paper deals with sample complexity and sequential algorithms, which are topics related to data structures and algorithms, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a possible sub-category.
