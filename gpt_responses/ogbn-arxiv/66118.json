The paper also presents algorithms for computing minimal absent words in trees, which involves computational complexity (cs.CC). The concept of minimal absent words is related to formal languages and automata, which falls under the category of formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). The paper also involves combinatorial analysis of trees, which is a topic in graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper presents bounds on the cardinality of the set of minimal absent words, which involves probabilistic and statistical analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
