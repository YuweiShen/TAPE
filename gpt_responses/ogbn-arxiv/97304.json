The paper proposes a novel framework to address the challenges of practical zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval, which involves machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. The paper also introduces a new dataset for this task, which falls under the category of multimedia (MM) research. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.IR, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
