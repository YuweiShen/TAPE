The proposed method involves graph regularization and discrete optimization, which are also relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper uses a supervised learning approach, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
