The paper also discusses deep learning, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of gradient-based encoding of local hand-crafted features is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also experiments with similarity computation, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the benefits of transferring representations over ConvNet layers, which is a common topic in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
