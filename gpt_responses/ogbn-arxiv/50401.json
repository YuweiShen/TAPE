The paper discusses the physical resource blocks (PRBs) orchestrated for bursty URLLC traffic in the time-frequency plane and formulates the problem of slicing a RAN enabling coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmissions for multicast eMBB and bursty URLLC service multiplexing as a multi-timescale optimization problem. These topics are closely related to networking and internet architecture. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the problem of slicing a RAN for serving two 5G use cases, i.e., enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC), and formulates the problem as a multi-timescale optimization problem. These topics are closely related to information theory. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the problem of slicing a RAN for serving two 5G use cases, i.e., enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC), and formulates the problem as a multi-timescale optimization problem.
