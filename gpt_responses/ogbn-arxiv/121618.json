This task falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and deep learning (cs.DL) sub-categories, as the authors use a Single Shot Detector (SSD) to locate formulas at multiple scales using sliding windows. Additionally, the paper involves information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques, as the authors train their model on a dataset and evaluate its performance using various metrics. Finally, the paper also touches on natural language processing (cs.CL) as it deals with detecting formulas embedded in textlines."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
