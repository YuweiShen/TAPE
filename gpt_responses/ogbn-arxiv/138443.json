It discusses the trade-offs between reduce side joins and map side joins and proposes a technique to make runtime decisions between the two options on a per key basis. The paper also considers load balancing taking into account the CPU, network and I/O costs as well as the load on compute and storage nodes. Given these considerations, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DB (database), cs.DC (distributed, parallel, and cluster computing), cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), cs.SY (systems and control), and cs.CR (cryptography and security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
