The problem of phase retrieval is also relevant to Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Signal Processing (cs.SP), as it involves recovering an unknown signal from its Fourier transform. The paper also mentions the use of masks and structured illuminations, which are techniques commonly used in the sub-category of Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the potential implications of its findings, which could be relevant to Multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
