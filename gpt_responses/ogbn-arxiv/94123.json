This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with the practical realization of large MIMO systems, which could fall under the Networked and Distributed Systems (cs.NI) or Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the complexity of the MIMO detector, which could be relevant to the Computer Engineering (cs.CE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed detector, which could be relevant to the Communications (cs.COM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
