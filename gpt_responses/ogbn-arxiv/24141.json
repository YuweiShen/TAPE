This is a control system design problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of mmWave frequencies for enhancing system throughput, which is relevant to multimedia applications that require high data rates. \n5. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper discusses the use of uniform planar array (UPA) antennas, which effectively place more antennas on a two-dimensional grid, for mmWave systems. This is a hardware architecture design problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
