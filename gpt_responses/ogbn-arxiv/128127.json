The use of coded side information is a common technique in information theory, and the paper focuses on its role in PIR. The paper also deals with privacy requirements, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). The problem of PIR involves accessing a database, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS). The paper presents capacity-achieving protocols, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper deals with the use of linear combinations, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
