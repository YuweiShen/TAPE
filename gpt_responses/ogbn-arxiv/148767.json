It could also belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category as MANETs are a type of distributed system. Additionally, the paper presents a proposed version of AODVv2 that improves performance, which could fall under the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) or Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. Finally, the paper could also be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category if the proposed version of AODVv2 uses machine learning techniques to improve performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
