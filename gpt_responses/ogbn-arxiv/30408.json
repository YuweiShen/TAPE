The use of Gaussian random matrices is a common technique in compressed sensing (cs.DS) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The study of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and the restricted isometry property also suggests a potential fit for signal processing (cs.SP). Finally, the mention of phaseless compressed sensing may indicate a connection to the subfield of inverse problems (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
