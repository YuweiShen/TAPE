This involves the use of time-delay selectivity to remove inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) caused by a cyclic prefix (CP) that is shorter than the maximum delay spread of the channel. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category deals with the study of communication systems and networks, including the design of coding and modulation schemes, channel capacity, and error control coding. The paper's focus on the design of a MIMO precoding method for OFDM transmission with insufficient CP is closely related to the research topics in this sub-category.\n- cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture): This sub-category deals with the design, analysis, and optimization of communication networks and protocols, including wireless networks, cellular networks, and the Internet. The paper's focus on the design of a MIMO precoding method for OFDM transmission is relevant to the research topics in this sub-category, particularly in the context of wireless communication systems.\n- cs.SI (Signal Processing): This sub-category deals with the analysis, processing, and interpretation of signals, including audio, image, and video signals, as well"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
