The proposed method involves optimizing a binary classifier for pairwise similarity prediction and through this process learns a multi-class classifier as a submodule. This work involves the use of neural network-based models and probabilistic graphical models, which are commonly used in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The application of this method is demonstrated in the supervised, unsupervised cross-task, and semi-supervised settings, which are all subcategories of machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.CL, and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
