Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of neural network models, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper investigates the positional effects of context words, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions biomedical domain datasets, which could indicate that it belongs to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
