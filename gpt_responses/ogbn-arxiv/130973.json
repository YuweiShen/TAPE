The approach is more analytically oriented and allows for the assessment of observed versus expected numbers of excellent papers for a city. While the paper does not explicitly mention computer science, the methodology and data analysis techniques used are relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, such as digital libraries (cs.DL), information retrieval (cs.IR), social and information networks (cs.SI), cybernetics (cs.CY), and software engineering (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
