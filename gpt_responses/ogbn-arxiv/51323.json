This falls under the sub-category of Speech and Dialogue (cs.SD). The paper also uses Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for the mapping, which is a common technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), making cs.CL and cs.LG likely sub-categories as well. The paper also involves predicting continuous pitch values, which is a signal processing task, making cs.SI a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for predicting vocoder parameters, which is a common technique in Neural Networks (NN) and Deep Learning (DL), making cs.NE a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
