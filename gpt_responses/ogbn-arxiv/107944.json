This involves learning to perturb the latent features of training examples in an input-dependent manner. This topic is closely related to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
