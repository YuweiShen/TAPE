The paper also mentions the use of hidden Markov models (HMM), which are commonly used in speech recognition. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SD (Sound), which deals with audio and speech processing. The paper also involves supervised and unsupervised learning, which are topics covered in cs.SI (Machine Learning), and the use of Bayesian methods, which are covered in cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves natural language processing, which is covered in cs.CL (Computation and Language).
