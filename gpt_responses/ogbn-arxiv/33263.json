The paper also discusses the suitability of these calculi for proof search, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the presence of structural rules, which are relevant to proof theory (cs.PL). The use of nested sequents is a technique commonly used in proof theory and logic (cs.DS), and the paper also discusses the subformula property, which is relevant to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
