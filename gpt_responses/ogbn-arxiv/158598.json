It may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as it deals with image processing. The use of deep neural networks suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves learning-to-rank, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and may also involve artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
