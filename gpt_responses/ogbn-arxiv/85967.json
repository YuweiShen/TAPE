The application of the proposed method is in the field of Multi Document Summarization, which involves information retrieval and natural language processing, hence it can also be categorized under Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also proposes a novel measure for ranking, which can be considered as a statistical learning problem falling under the scope of Machine Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with handling inconsistent and missing data, which can be categorized under Signal Processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
