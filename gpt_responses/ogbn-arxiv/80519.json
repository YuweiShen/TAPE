This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the evaluation of outage probability, level crossing rate, and average fade duration, which are common metrics in the field of wireless communication. This could potentially place the paper under the sub-categories of game theory (cs.GT) or modeling and simulation (cs.MS). Finally, the paper also presents closed-form expressions for probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions, which could be of interest to researchers in statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
