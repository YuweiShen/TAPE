Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses the use of long-range, low-power networks, which falls under the category of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the cyber-physical attack surface, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses the use of modulation types in the protocol, which falls under the category of cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper discusses the use of commodity hardware to conduct attacks, which falls under the category of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
