The use of FEC codes and the study of error exponents also suggest the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The study of theoretic limits and achievable rates may also fall under the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the use of mismatched FEC decoders may also relate to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
