The focus on sparse connectivity is also a popular area of research in neural networks, as it can lead to more efficient and interpretable models. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of score functions, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
