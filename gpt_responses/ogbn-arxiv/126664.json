The proposed method uses multi-task learning and metric learning, which are common machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The paper also discusses experiments on real-world data, which involves graphics (GR) techniques. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV. The other likely sub-categories are cs.RO, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.GR, in decreasing order of likelihood."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
