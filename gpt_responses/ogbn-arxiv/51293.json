This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of sparse movement primitive parameters, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper presents real robot experiments, which can be considered as a system and control (cs.SY) problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
