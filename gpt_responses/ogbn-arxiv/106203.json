It may also belong to Multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with learning human perceptions of images. Information Retrieval (cs.IR) is another likely sub-category as the paper discusses collecting and embedding qualitative measures. Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) are also possible sub-categories as the paper involves optimization algorithms and clustering queries."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
