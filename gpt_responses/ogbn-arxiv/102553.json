It also involves the study of vectorial functions and their properties, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also presents results on the boomerang connectivity table and its relation to the zeros of the second-order derivative of the permutation, which can be seen as a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
