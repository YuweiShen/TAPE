The paper discusses the benefits and problems of stateful forwarding in CCN and proposes a new stateless architecture for CCN. Therefore, cs.NI is the most likely category for this paper. \n\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper discusses the susceptibility of CCN to router state exhaustion attacks and interest flooding attacks, which are security concerns. Therefore, cs.CR is a likely category for this paper. \n\n3. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) - The paper briefly mentions the resource requirements of the proposed stateless architecture for CCN. Therefore, cs.AR is a possible category for this paper. \n\n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper discusses the efficiency of stateful forwarding in CCN and proposes a new architecture that provides nearly all functionality of the stateful design without its headaches. Therefore, cs.DC is a possible category for this paper. \n\n5. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the paradigm shift from host-centric to content-centric networking and the use of named and addressable content in ICN. Therefore, cs.IT is a possible category for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
