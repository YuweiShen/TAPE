The paper proposes a parameterized analysis of the computational complexity of these problems, which is a common approach in the field of theoretical computer science. The paper also discusses the use of indexing to refine the recurrence formulas underlying the dynamic programming solutions, which is a technique commonly used in data structures and algorithms. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category covers research on the design, analysis, and implementation of efficient algorithms and data structures for solving computational problems. The paper's focus on dynamic programming and indexing techniques makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): This sub-category covers research on mathematical structures and techniques that are relevant to computer science. The paper's use of parameterized analysis and recurrence formulas makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): This sub-category covers research on the classification and analysis of computational problems based on their inherent difficulty. The paper's focus on worst-case and intermediate-case analysis of the Edit Distance and Longest Common Sub Sequence makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n- cs.IT ("}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
