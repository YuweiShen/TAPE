The paper also focuses on improving the performance of deep networks through the use of this activation function, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of benchmarks such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, MNIST, and ImageNet, which are commonly used in the field of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
