The use of empirical risk minimization and the mention of neural networks suggest that the paper may fall under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The mention of Euclidean space and experimental results suggest that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). The use of ordinal embedding and the mention of human-friendly data collection suggest that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
