The paper proposes a novel network architecture to address the information imbalance problem in object detection, which involves combining spatial and semantic information in different layers of the network. This is a problem that requires a combination of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The paper also involves designing a fusing module to combine features from different parts of the network, which is a topic related to neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
