The paper also proposes the use of optimization techniques to optimize the parameter space and investigate the use of self-adaptive differential evolution (DE) to ameliorate the difficulties of finding appropriate input parameters for the DE technique. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also uses a neuromorphic dynamic vision sensor (DVS) and incorporates computer vision techniques, which suggests the sub-category cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) as the third likely category. The paper also deals with control and optimization, which suggests the sub-categories cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.LG (Learning) as the fourth and fifth likely categories, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
