The problem involves finding a mapping from the letters of a pattern to non-empty substrings of a text, with the goal of minimizing the number of wildcards used. This problem is closely related to several areas of computer science, including data structures, computational complexity, discrete mathematics, computational geometry, and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
