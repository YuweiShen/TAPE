The proposed channel estimation and precoding techniques involve signal processing and optimization, which could also be categorized under systems and control (cs.SY). The use of Fourier/Laplace series and geometric modeling suggests a mathematical approach, which could be classified under multimedia (cs.MM) and mathematical analysis (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
