The paper also discusses the algebraic structure of codes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). The use of Abelian groups in the codes suggests a connection to algebraic coding theory and group theory, which are topics in computer science (cs.DS) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the input alphabet size of the channel, which is a topic in network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
