The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the problem and its equivalence to the $(\\min, +)$ convolution problem, which suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. The paper proposes algorithms with near-linear running times, which could be of interest to researchers in computational geometry (cs.CG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
