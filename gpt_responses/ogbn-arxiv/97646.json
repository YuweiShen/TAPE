The use of Bayesian decision-making and the consideration of Bayes risk suggest that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT). The study of how earlier-acting agents can be informative to later-acting agents suggests that the paper may also be relevant to social networks and social media (cs.SI). Finally, the consideration of trade-offs in decision-making suggests that the paper may also be relevant to game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
