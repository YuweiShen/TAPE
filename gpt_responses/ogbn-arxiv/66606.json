The approach used is via solving a regularized M-estimator, which is a popular method in these fields. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Statistics (cs.ST), Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), and Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
