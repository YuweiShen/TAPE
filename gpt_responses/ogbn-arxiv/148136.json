The use of a segmentation approach and a weighted average rule also suggests the paper could be categorized under machine learning (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The end-to-end training of the network and the use of a regression-based fusion function suggest the paper could also be categorized under deep learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
