The authors propose a moment-based estimator with optimal convergence rate and provide upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity of the problem. This is a classic problem in machine learning and falls under the purview of cs.LG.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses information-theoretic arguments to derive lower bounds on the sample complexity of the problem. Specifically, they use Fano's inequality to show that a certain amount of information is required to estimate the parameters of the mixture, and then use this to derive lower bounds on the sample complexity. This is a standard technique in information theory and suggests that the paper could be classified under cs.IT.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a novel dimensionality reduction technique that reduces the sample complexity of the problem up to a logarithmic factor in the dimension. This technique involves projecting the data onto a random subspace and then applying the moment-based estimator to the projected data. This is a technique commonly used in data structures and algorithms, and suggests that the paper could be classified under cs.DS.\n- cs.ST (Statistics): The paper is concerned with the problem of statistical estimation of the parameters of a mixture of two Gaussians.
