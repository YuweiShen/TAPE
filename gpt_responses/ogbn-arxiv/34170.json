This topic is closely related to computational linguistics (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG), as the paper discusses techniques for integrating typological features into multilingual models. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of cross-lingual transfer and multilingual joint models, which are common in natural language processing (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of databases and automatic feature extraction, which are relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) and data mining (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
