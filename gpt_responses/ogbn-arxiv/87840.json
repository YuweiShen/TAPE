This falls under the domain of social networks and information networks.\n2. cs.SD (Software Engineering) - The paper proposes a new model for analyzing dynamic networks, which can be useful in software engineering for developing better algorithms for network analysis.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper uses variational inference and regularized spectral clustering to fit the proposed model to real network data sets. This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper uses a stochastic block model for static networks as inspiration for the proposed block point process model for dynamic networks. This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a new model for analyzing dynamic networks and develops efficient local search and variational inference procedures.
