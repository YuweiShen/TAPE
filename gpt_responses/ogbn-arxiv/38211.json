This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The proposed framework also involves graph convolutional networks (GCN) for feature learning, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses benchmark datasets for evaluation, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
