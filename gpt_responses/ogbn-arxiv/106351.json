This involves the integration of various entities in the automotive ecosystem, such as auto manufacturers, software providers, service technicians, and vehicle owners. The paper also discusses the use of sensors and vehicular communications to gather data for liability attribution, as well as the potential for attacks from interacting entities. These topics are relevant to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SE (Software Engineering), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
