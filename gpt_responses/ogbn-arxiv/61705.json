This involves solving an integer program to obtain a consistent representation of the unsafe set. The paper also provides theoretical analysis on what subset of the constraint can be learnable from safe demonstrations. Given these factors, the most likely sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
