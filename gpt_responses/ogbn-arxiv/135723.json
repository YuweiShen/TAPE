This falls under the domain of game theory, making cs.GT the most likely category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes practical and robust strategies for the bidders to increase their utility in the auction. This involves decision-making and optimization, which are key areas of AI research.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The exploration phase of the auction involves learning the value distributions of the bidders, which can be seen as a machine learning problem. The paper may use techniques from this field to address this problem.\n4. cs.EC (Economics and Computation): The paper deals with auction mechanisms and revenue maximization, which are topics at the intersection of economics and computation.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper may use algorithms and data structures to efficiently compute the optimal bidding strategies for the bidders."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
