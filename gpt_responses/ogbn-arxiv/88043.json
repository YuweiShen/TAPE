The paper also discusses the behavior of the total variation distance, which is a common metric in multimedia (MM) and networking and internet architecture (NI) research. Additionally, the paper's focus on practical covert communication suggests that it may also fall under the security and privacy (SI) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
