The paper proposes a novel hierarchical multi-task learning framework for jointly predicting rumor stance and veracity on Twitter, which involves modeling the structural property based on a graph convolutional network and exploiting the temporal dynamics of stance evolution. Therefore, the sub-categories of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) and Sound and Music Computing (cs.SD) are also relevant. Additionally, the paper involves machine learning techniques, which are related to the sub-categories of Cybersecurity (cs.CY) and Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
