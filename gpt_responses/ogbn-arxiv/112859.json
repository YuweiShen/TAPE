Additionally, the paper involves training and evaluating a deep learning model, which falls under machine learning (cs.MM) and machine learning algorithms (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of a large dataset and the analysis of image features, which could be categorized under information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper proposes a web-based application that could be used in real-life applications, which could be considered under human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
