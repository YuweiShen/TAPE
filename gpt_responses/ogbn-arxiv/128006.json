This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The paper also discusses embedding policy annotations in C's type system via a source-to-source translation, which falls under programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also discusses achieving high performance and scalability, which falls under systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses formal connections between the policy annotations and an information flow type system, which falls under logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
