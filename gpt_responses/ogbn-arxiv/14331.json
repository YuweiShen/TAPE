This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM), as well as signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper discusses the physical properties of the channel, which could fall under the category of physics (cs.PH)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
