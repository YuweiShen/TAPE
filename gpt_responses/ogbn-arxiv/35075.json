The approach involves training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) regressor using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and fully-connected layers. As such, this paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): This paper deals with the use of machine learning techniques for improving the design of Integrated Circuits (ICs) and System-on-Chip (SoC), which is an emerging area of research. \n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): This paper deals with the design and optimization of hardware architectures for ICs and SoCs, which is a relevant topic in this paper. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This paper involves the use of machine learning techniques for predicting the QoR of synthesis flows, which is a subfield of AI. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This paper deals with the design and optimization of control systems for ICs and SoCs, which is a relevant topic in this paper. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): This paper involves the development of a software tool for estimating the QoR of synthesis flows, which is a relevant topic in software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
