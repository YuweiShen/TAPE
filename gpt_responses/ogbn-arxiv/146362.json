MDL is a concept from information theory. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): NMF is a popular technique in artificial intelligence for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): NMF has been used in social network analysis for community detection and link prediction. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on heterogeneous data-sets which could include social network data. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): NMF is a matrix factorization technique which can be seen as a type of algorithm for data analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
