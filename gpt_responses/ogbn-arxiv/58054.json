The paper proposes a new module for learning feature pyramids in DCNNs, which involves designing a multi-branch network and weight initialization, both of which are topics in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also evaluates its method on two standard benchmarks for human pose estimation, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a new method for weight initialization in multi-branch networks, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
