This involves information theory concepts such as channel gains and data streams. \n2. cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses modulation schemes for frequency-selective channels, which is a common topic in communication networks. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new modulation scheme that involves optimizing the subcarrier-group mapping to maximize the achievable sum-rate, which can be seen as a control problem. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses modulation schemes for wireless communication, which is a common topic in networking and internet architecture. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses modulation schemes that can improve the rate-PAPR trade-off over conventional OFDM and SC-FDE, which can be relevant for multimedia applications that require high data rates."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
