This involves solving a novel minimax optimization problem and learning two convex functions. The paper also builds upon recent advances in the field of input convex neural networks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves optimization and numerical experiments, which makes cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) another likely sub-category. The paper also deals with learning the optimal transport map, which is a problem in optimization and artificial intelligence, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. The paper also involves image processing and computer vision, making cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper also involves control systems and optimization, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) another likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
