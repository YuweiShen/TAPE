The paper proposes an indexing technique specifically designed for processing reachability and time-based path queries in a temporal graph. This work involves data structures and algorithms for efficient query processing, which are typically studied in the areas of database systems (cs.DB) and data structures (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper deals with information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) problems related to temporal graphs. Finally, the paper proposes a scalable method for processing queries, which is a topic of interest in the field of scalable systems (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
