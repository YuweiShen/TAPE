The proposed scheme uses compressive sensing to identify the strong users and estimate their channel state information, which is a technique commonly used in information theory. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a scheme for relay-aided multiuser networks, which is a topic of interest in networking and internet architecture. The proposed scheme reduces the feedback overhead by identifying the strong users and estimating their channel state information using compressive sensing. \n\n3. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper uses compressive sensing to identify the strong users and estimate their channel state information, which is a signal processing technique. The paper also introduces a back-off strategy to minimize the effect of noise on the estimated CSI. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the problem of feedback reduction in multiuser networks, which is relevant to multimedia applications that require high data rates and low latency. The proposed scheme achieves a rate close to that obtained by scheduling schemes that require dedicated error-free feedback from all the network users. \n\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper uses compressive sensing to identify the strong users and estimate their channel state information, which is a computational technique."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
