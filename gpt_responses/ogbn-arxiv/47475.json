The study explores how automation contributes to spiritual experience and how participants orient to the use of automation as a religious custom. This aligns with the research area of Human-Computer Interaction, which studies the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use.\n\n2. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses the relationship of home automation to family life and draws design implications for the broader population. This aligns with the research area of Computers and Society, which studies the social and ethical impacts of computing technologies on individuals, organizations, and society.\n\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The study involves 20 American Orthodox Jewish families, which can be seen as a social network. The paper discusses how automation was seen by participants to contribute to spiritual experience, which can be seen as a form of social interaction. This aligns with the research area of Social and Information Networks, which studies the analysis and modeling of social and information networks.\n\n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - This paper does not involve any computational complexity analysis or algorithms. However, it is possible that some aspects of the home automation technologies used by the participants involve computational complexity. Therefore, this research area"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
