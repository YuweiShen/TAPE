The paper also discusses the combination of controllers for multiple objectives, which can be considered as a system control problem (cs.SY). The use of Riemannian Motion Policies (RMPs) for describing controllers on manifolds suggests a focus on mathematical optimization and control (cs.MA). The paper also mentions the use of algorithms for combining controllers, which can be considered as an artificial intelligence problem (cs.AI). Finally, the validation of the proposed algorithms through both simulated tasks and robotic implementations suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
