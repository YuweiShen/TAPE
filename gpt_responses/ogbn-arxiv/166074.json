The use of bandit feedback also suggests a connection to reinforcement learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of kernel Perceptron, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper's focus on linear separability and mistake bounds suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG) and theoretical computer science (cs.TH)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
