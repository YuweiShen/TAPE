The paper also considers confidentiality of messages, which is a key aspect of cryptography (cs.CR). The use of cognizant messages and the concept of indirect decoding suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the fields of signal processing and machine learning (cs.SI, cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with the capabilities of different receivers in the channel, which could be relevant to the field of networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
