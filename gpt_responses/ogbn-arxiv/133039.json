The paper also explores ways to achieve comparable results with less compute, which is a common problem in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of edge devices is also a key aspect of the paper, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of different architectures and testing procedures, which could also fall under neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
