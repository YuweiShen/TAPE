The paper proposes a novel architecture for improving the performance of U-Net like networks by incorporating parallel decoders for contour prediction and distance map estimation. This involves learning auxiliary tasks, which could also fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also uses publicly available datasets, which could fall under the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a new joint loss function, which could also fall under the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
