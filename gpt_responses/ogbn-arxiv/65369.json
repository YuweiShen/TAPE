It is also likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories because the corpus is used for training and evaluating systems for sarcasm detection. Additionally, the paper provides user and conversation context, which suggests that it may also belong to the social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-category.
