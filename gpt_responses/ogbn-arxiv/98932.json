The use of deep neural networks for predicting taxi trip time and spatio-temporal mining also suggests that the paper could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI). The development of a simulation environment for RL training and the focus on transportation efficiency and traffic congestion suggest that the paper could also be categorized under computer engineering (cs.CE) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
