It may also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category as it discusses the demands of users on servers and their ability to service tasks. The paper also touches upon system and control theory (cs.SY) as it proposes a new fair allocation mechanism. Additionally, it may belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category as it discusses the shortcomings of existing allocation mechanisms. Finally, it may belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category as it evaluates the performance of the proposed mechanism through simulations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
