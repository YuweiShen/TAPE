This topic falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper proposes methods for mitigating these risks, which involve randomizing inputs and optimizing decoding performance. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of human-computer interaction (cs.HC), software engineering (cs.SE), information theory (cs.IT), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
