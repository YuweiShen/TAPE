The paper also discusses the impacts of imperfect channel state information (CSI) and applies the proposed framework to multiuser access scenarios, which are topics related to signal processing (cs.SI) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed architecture in terms of energy consumption, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
