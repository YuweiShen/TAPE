This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions security options and scalability constraints, which are relevant to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of a central server and the experiences with developing, maintaining, and deploying a P2P VPN, which are relevant to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) and Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates the reference implementation by comparing it quantitatively to other VPN technologies focusing on latency, bandwidth, and memory usage, which suggests that the paper is also relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
