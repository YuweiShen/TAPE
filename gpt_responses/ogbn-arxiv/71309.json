It discusses the use of Interest messages and Data objects, which are key components of the NDN protocol. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper focuses on the delivery of scalable video, which is a multimedia application. It proposes a rate allocation algorithm that maximizes the average quality of the video delivered to the client population. \n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the use of network coding, which is a technique from information theory that can improve the efficiency of data transmission in networks. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly discuss security, but the use of Bloom filters to store additional information about Interest messages and Data objects could have implications for security and privacy. \n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a network coding enabled NDN architecture, which involves distributed processing and coordination of forwarding decisions among intermediate nodes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
