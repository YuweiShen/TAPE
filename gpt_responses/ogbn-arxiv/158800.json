The proposed technique is applicable to a variety of DNN architectures, which suggests a broader scope and potential relevance to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural engineering (cs.NE). The paper also mentions experiments on RNNs, indicating potential relevance to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
