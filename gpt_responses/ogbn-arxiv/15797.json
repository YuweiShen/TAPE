The paper also involves numerical methods for generating samples of the small-scale fading, which could be categorized under numerical analysis (cs.NA). The use of Fourier transform and plane-wave spectral representation suggests a connection to signal processing and imaging (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the potential benefits of holographic MIMO in terms of energy and spectral efficiency, which could be related to multimedia systems (cs.MM). Finally, the physical model of the scalar Helmholtz equation suggests a connection to electromagnetics (cs.EM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
