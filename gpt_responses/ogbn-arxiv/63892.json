The paper also proposes a new metric for errors and provides upper and lower bounds on network capacity, which falls under the category of theoretical computer science (cs.THE). The paper also discusses a computationally-efficient concatenation scheme, which involves algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper discusses the end-to-end nature of the design, which involves communication and information theory (cs.CC) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
