The paper proposes three sets of features, depending on whether they are related to the speech or the glottal signal, or to prosody. The paper also assesses the relevancy of these features through mutual information-based measures. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SD (Sound), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SI (Signal Processing), and cs.SDQ (Speech and Audio Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
