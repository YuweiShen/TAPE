The paper proposes a method for verifying masked arithmetic programs, which involves analyzing the program's code and its potential vulnerabilities to side-channel attacks. This suggests that the paper could also be classified under programming languages (cs.PL) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of their proposed method in a tool, which could fall under software engineering (cs.SE) or systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
