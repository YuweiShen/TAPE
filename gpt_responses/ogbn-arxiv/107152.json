The paper proposes a novel transmission scheme exploiting channel reciprocity for joint downlink beamformed information data communication and uplink channel estimation through training data transmission. The paper also presents a unified optimization framework for all involved FD MIMO design parameters. The paper's content is related to Information Theory (cs.IT) as it deals with channel estimation and data transmission. It is also related to Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) as it deals with MIMO radios for communication. The paper's content is also related to Systems and Control (cs.SY) as it deals with control information exchange. The paper's content is also related to Multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with data transmission. Finally, the paper's content is related to Architecture (cs.AR) as it deals with the design of FD MIMO radios."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
