Additionally, the paper may also belong to the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL) because it evaluates the performance of different recurrent networks on learning Tomita grammars, which are commonly used in natural language processing. The paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) because it deals with the interpretation and verification of neural networks. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR) because rule extraction can be used to analyze the behavior of black-box models, which is important for security applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
