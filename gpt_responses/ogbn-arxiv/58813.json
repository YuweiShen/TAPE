The paper also proposes a hybrid classifier that combines statistical paradigms with networked models, which is a topic that falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses authorship attribution and translationese identification, which are tasks related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and social network analysis (cs.SI).
