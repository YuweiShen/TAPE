The paper also involves manifold learning (cs.MM) and Gestalt psychology theory (cs.HC) to solve the incompatibility problem between image descriptor and ranking. The paper proposes a new holistic descriptor called Perceptual Uniform Descriptor (PUD) and uses manifold ranking to realize image retrieval, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
