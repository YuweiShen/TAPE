The use of fused lasso penalty is a popular technique in this area, and the paper proposes a new formulation for this problem. The motivating example of analyzing brain networks using neuroimaging data suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The use of neuroimaging data also suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the use of a second-order method and a screening rule suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
