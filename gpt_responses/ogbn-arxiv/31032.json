The authors also mention using weak image-level labels to train convolutional neural networks, which falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper specifically focuses on histopathology images, which could also place it under the sub-categories of multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
