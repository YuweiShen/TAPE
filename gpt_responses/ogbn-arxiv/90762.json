This approach falls under the category of unsupervised or self-supervised learning, which is typically associated with the sub-categories of cs.SD (Sound) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper involves the use of neural networks and optimization techniques, which are common in the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks).
