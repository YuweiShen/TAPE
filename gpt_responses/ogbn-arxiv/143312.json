The use of multi-task learning and convolutional neural networks also suggests a potential fit for the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of crowdsourcing to obtain demographic attributes, which could potentially fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The use of deep learning and machine learning techniques also suggests a potential fit for the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.
