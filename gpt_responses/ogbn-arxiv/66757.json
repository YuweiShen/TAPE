The use of MLPs to extract these relations also falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the importance of understanding how the network learns and represents spatial relations, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of natural language to describe spatial relations, which falls under the category of natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper uses the sun09 dataset, which is a dataset commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
