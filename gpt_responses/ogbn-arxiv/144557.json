The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short term memory models (LSTMs) also suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-category of computer vision (cs.CV). However, the use of LSTMs also suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-category of natural language processing (NLP) (cs.CL). The use of deep learning models also suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of recognizing text in unconstrained environments, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
