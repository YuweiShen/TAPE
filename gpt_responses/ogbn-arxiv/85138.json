The formulation of the problem as a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) suggests that it belongs to the sub-category of cs.AI. The use of structural results and threshold curves to characterize the optimal multiple stopping policy is a common approach in optimization and control theory, which suggests that it also belongs to the sub-category of cs.DS. The application of the framework to interactive advertising in social media suggests that it belongs to the sub-category of cs.SI. Finally, the use of copositive ordering and stochastic gradient algorithms suggests that it also belongs to the sub-categories of cs.IT and cs.LG, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
