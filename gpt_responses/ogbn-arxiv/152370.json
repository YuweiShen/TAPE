This topic falls under the area of logic in computer science (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of matrices and linear equation systems, which are common topics in computational complexity (cs.CC), data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
