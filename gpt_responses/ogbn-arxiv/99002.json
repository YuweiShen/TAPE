Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper specifically mentions experiments on image datasets such as MNIST and Cifar-10, indicating a focus on computer vision, which falls under cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the quality of labels, which is a common issue in artificial intelligence, suggesting a possible fit for cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the size of datasets, which is a common topic in data science, suggesting a possible fit for cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of data quality on model accuracy, which is a common topic in information retrieval, suggesting a possible fit for cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
