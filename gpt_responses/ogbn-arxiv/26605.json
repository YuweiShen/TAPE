The paper also introduces a new contest model and analyzes the equilibrium strategies of the users. \n2. cs.CY (Computational Geometry): Although not directly related to geometry, the paper involves optimization and design of a mechanism, which can be considered as a computational problem. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an intelligent mechanism to motivate users to participate in crowd sourcing campaigns. The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the mechanism. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper involves the design of an optimal contest mechanism, which can be considered as an algorithmic problem. The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the mechanism. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper involves the analysis of user behavior in a crowd sourcing campaign, which can be considered as a social network problem. The paper also discusses the impact of the mechanism on the revenue of the crowdsourcer."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
