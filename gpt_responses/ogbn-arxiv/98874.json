The proposed approach involves learning a domain-invariant classifier with structural risk minimization, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of deep methods, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the experiments involve image and video datasets, which are commonly used in multimedia research (cs.MM). Finally, the paper mentions the use of neural networks, which is a common technique in neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
