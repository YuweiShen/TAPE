The use of Haar wavelet sparsity prior suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.IT (information theory) or cs.SP (signal processing) categories. The mention of computational imaging applications and single-pixel imaging suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.CV (computer vision) or cs.MM (multimedia) categories. Finally, the use of numerical simulations and sample-complexity bounds suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.LG (machine learning) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
