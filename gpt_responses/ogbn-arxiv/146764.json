The paper also involves the use of numerical methods (cs.NA) to determine density thresholds. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the constructed hypergraphs in information retrieval (cs.IT) and their usefulness in reducing memory usage (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
