The approach involves feedback and crowdsourcing that enables highlighting of the specific location on the page where the lookup word is found, annotation, digitization, and fielded searching. This paper is likely to belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category as it deals with indexing and searching of raster images. It could also belong to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category as it deals with language dictionaries and word indexes. The paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques for digitization, which could place it in the Deep Learning (cs.DL) sub-category. The paper also discusses the usability and accessibility of the proposed approach, which could place it in the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with complex script languages, which could place it in the Computational Complexity (cs.CY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
