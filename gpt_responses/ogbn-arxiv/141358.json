The paper proposes a new objective function for embedding learning, which involves optimizing both intra- and inter-class objectives separately. This is a machine learning (cs.LG) problem, as it involves optimizing a loss function. The paper also proposes two sampling-based variants to reduce computation cost, which involves algorithmic development and optimization, falling under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. The experiments involve face verification, which is a multimedia (cs.MM) application. Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency of the proposed method, which involves optimization and training, falling under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
