The paper relies on spatio-temporal modeling and event detection in IR image sequences, which suggests that it belongs to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of deep networks for spatio-temporal modeling further supports the inclusion of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as a likely sub-category. The paper also involves tracking and classification of cars, which suggests that robotics (cs.RO) could be another relevant sub-category. Finally, the use of infrared imaging as a sensing modality suggests that the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR) could also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
