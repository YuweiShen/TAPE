The paper discusses the use of virtualization to host all middlebox functions on each server node, which changes the optimization problem to a multi-commodity flow problem. This topic falls under the category of computer networks (cs.NI) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the allocation of resources to maximize processed flow, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses design problems related to processing and routing demands, which falls under the category of performance (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
