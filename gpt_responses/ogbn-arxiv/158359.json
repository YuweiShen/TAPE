The use of optimization techniques and prediction models also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The study involves the use of a building thermal simulator, which could be classified under computer engineering (cs.CE) or software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
