These topics are typically covered in the sub-categories of cs.SI (Signal and Image Processing), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.SP (Speech Processing). The paper also proposes algorithms that adaptively learn the number of sources and estimate their locations, which falls under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper uses the relationship between the source localization problem and the problem of computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) for polynomials, which is a topic in numerical analysis and falls under the sub-category of cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SI, cs.IT, and cs.SP, followed by cs.LG and cs.NA."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
