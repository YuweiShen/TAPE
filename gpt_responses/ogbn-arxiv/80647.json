The use of Massive MIMO technology and the consideration of both co-located and Cell-Free architectures suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the Signal Processing (cs.SY) and Multimedia (cs.MM) categories. Finally, the use of Lyapunov optimization techniques and the focus on stability and performance optimization suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DS) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
