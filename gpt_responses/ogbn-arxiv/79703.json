The paper presents new upper and lower bounds for (A)LSH-based algorithms, which are commonly used in data mining and machine learning. This suggests that the paper could be categorized under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), or cs.DB (Databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
