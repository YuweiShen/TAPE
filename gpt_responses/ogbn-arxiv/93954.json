This falls under the domain of algorithms and data structures, making cs.DS the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper establishes the NP-completeness of the Tatamibari puzzle, which is a classic problem in computational complexity. Hence, cs.CC is also a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper involves partitioning a grid into rectangles, which is a problem in computational geometry. Hence, cs.CG is a possible sub-category.\n4. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper deals with a puzzle game, which involves game theory concepts such as strategy and complexity. Hence, cs.GT is also a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves solving a puzzle game, which is a problem in artificial intelligence.
