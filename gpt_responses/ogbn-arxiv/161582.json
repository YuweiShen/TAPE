This is a well-studied problem in the information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SP) communities. The paper proposes an anti-uncertainty constraint to deal with the MMU, which involves a mixed L2 and L1 norm. This is a common approach in the machine learning (cs.LG) community for promoting sparsity. The paper also models the MMU as a bounded additive error, which is a common assumption in the numerical analysis (cs.NA) community. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT and cs.SP, followed by cs.LG, cs.MM, and cs.NA."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
