This involves techniques such as tf-idf and near-synonym weighting. These techniques are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also evaluates the performance of the system using precision and accuracy metrics, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the system is designed to match college events and groups to students, which could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI) or cyber-physical systems (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
