The paper specifically focuses on modeling US postal addresses, which involves structured data and could fall under \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI), \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\" (cs.CV), or \"Computation and Language\" (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the challenges of training VAEs, such as posterior collapse and difficulty in mapping generated samples to the latent space, which could fall under \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
