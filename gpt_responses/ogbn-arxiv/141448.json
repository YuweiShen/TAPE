This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with the practical use of third-party DNN IP cores, which could fall under the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The proposed method involves selecting samples from the DNN training set and applying a gradient-based method, which suggests that the paper could also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the functionality of DNN IPs, which could fall under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
