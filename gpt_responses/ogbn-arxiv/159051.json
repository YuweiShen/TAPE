The use of a stochastic first order oracle also suggests a machine learning context. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the rate of growth of a function, which is a concept commonly used in information theory. The use of a Tsybakov-like noise condition also suggests an information theoretic approach. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper deals with optimization, which is a fundamental problem in algorithms. The use of a stochastic first order oracle also suggests an algorithmic approach. \n4. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper deals with optimization of a convex function, which is a common problem in neural networks. The use of a stochastic first order oracle also suggests a neural network context. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with optimization, which is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence.
