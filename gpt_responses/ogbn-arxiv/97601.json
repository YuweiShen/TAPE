The paper specifically focuses on the case where the signal has a sparse representation in a specified dictionary, which is a common assumption in compressive sensing. The paper proposes a method for subsampling a fixed orthogonal matrix in such a way that the $D$-RIP will hold, provided this basis is sufficiently incoherent with the sparsifying dictionary $D$. This is a significant contribution to the theory of compressive sensing, as it allows for compressive sensing recovery guarantees for structured measurements and redundant dictionaries, opening the door to a wide array of practical applications. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SP (Signal Processing), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves numerical simulations, which suggests that it may also be relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
