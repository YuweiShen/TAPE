The use of planar graphs and planar duality suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.CG (Computational Geometry) sub-category. The mention of linear programming relaxations and integrality gap suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) sub-categories. The focus on approximation algorithms suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
