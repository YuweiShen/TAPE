The paper also introduces a new method called expectation-linear dropout neural networks, which is a modification of the standard dropout technique. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
