The paper focuses on improving the scalability of mutation analysis, which is a common problem in software testing. The paper proposes a new approach called AccMut, which automatically detects equivalence modulo states among a statement and its mutations, groups the statements into equivalence classes modulo states, and uses only one process to represent each class. This approach can significantly reduce the number of split processes and accelerate mutation analysis. The paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new approach to improve the scalability of mutation analysis, which is a software testing technique. The paper is likely to be relevant to the software engineering community. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper proposes a new approach to detect equivalence modulo states among statements and mutations. The paper is likely to be relevant to the programming languages community. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new approach to improve the scalability of mutation analysis. The paper is likely to be relevant to the systems and control community. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new approach to reduce redundant execution in mutation analysis. The paper is likely to be relevant to the machine learning community, which often deals with large datasets and needs to optimize the execution time. \n- cs.SE ("}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
