The paper also proposes a new protocol for aggregation that is more efficient and has lower communication and error costs, which relates to topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). The use of mixnets and shuffling techniques also suggests a potential connection to information theory (cs.IT) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
