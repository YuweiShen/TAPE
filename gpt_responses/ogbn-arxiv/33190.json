The use of short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and semidefinite relaxation-based algorithm (STliFT) suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Sound and Music Computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
