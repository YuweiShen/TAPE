Therefore, cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses a goal-directed proof procedure that interprets logical symbols as search directives, which is a topic in artificial intelligence and automated reasoning, making cs.AI a likely sub-category as well. The paper also introduces a modified set of assumptions and derived rules, which are topics in programming languages and formal methods, making cs.PL a possible sub-category. The paper also discusses the handling of disjunctive information and hypotheticals, which are topics in data structures and software engineering, making cs.DS and cs.SE possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
