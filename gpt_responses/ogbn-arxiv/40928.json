The use of videos and temporal information suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM). The paper proposes a new method for weakly supervised learning, which involves training a neural network with limited or noisy labels, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of proxy ground-truth and aggregation techniques suggests a possible connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves information retrieval, as it deals with finding relevant information in web videos, which is a topic in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
