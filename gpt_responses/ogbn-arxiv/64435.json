The feedback control approach used in the paper is also a common technique in robotics. \n- cs.ME (Mechanical Engineering): The paper deals with the manufacturing of a cantilever beam with precise structural requirements, which is a typical problem in mechanical engineering. The paper also uses a simple structural mechanics model to describe the printing process. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents a finite-horizon discrete control problem to optimize the printing process of the cantilever beam. The feedback control approach used in the paper is also a common technique in systems and control. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper uses a model linking the widths of the different layers of the printed part to its final stiffness, which can be seen as a computational engineering problem. The paper also uses optimization techniques to solve the control problem. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper does not directly deal with multimedia, but it presents a method to manufacture cantilever beams with various final shapes, which can be used in multimedia applications such as micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
