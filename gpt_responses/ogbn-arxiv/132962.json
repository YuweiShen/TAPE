The use of sphere-like structures suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG), while the mention of submodularity and Lipschitz continuity suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the mention of problems in computer vision suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
