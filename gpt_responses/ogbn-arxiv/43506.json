The paper proposes a deep robust regression model for safe exploration, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also integrates the robust regression approach with model-based control methods, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper discusses generalization bounds under domain shifts for learning, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and statistical learning (cs.SD). Overall, the paper covers a broad range of topics in computer science, but the most likely categories are those that are directly related to the proposed approach and its applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
