The paper also mentions the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for applications such as face recognition and object detection, which are commonly associated with computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of hardware specialized for DNN inferences, which falls under the category of embedded systems (cs.ET). The paper also mentions the optimization of energy and latency constraints, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY).
