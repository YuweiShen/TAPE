The focus is on enhancing the quality of experience (QoE) via enhanced contrast. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), which deals with the interaction between humans and computers. The paper also uses machine learning techniques to classify the physiological signals, which suggests that it could belong to cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.CV (Computer Vision), or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper deals with image and video processing, which could place it in the cs.SD (Sound and Image Processing) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
