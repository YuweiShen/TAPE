This involves observing the state of the system through imprecise sensors that provide correct information about the current state with a fixed probability. This model is closely related to partial-observation stochastic games, which are a well-studied topic in game theory and computer science. Therefore, the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.GT (Game Theory), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Additionally, the paper deals with the complexity of the new class of games, which suggests that it could also be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
