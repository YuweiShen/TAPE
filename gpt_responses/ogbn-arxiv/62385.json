The use of automata and efficient implementation suggest a focus on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The application of the automaton to similarity search suggests information retrieval (cs.IR) and data mining (cs.DM) as likely sub-categories. The study of properties of the automaton and experimental results suggest theoretical computer science (cs.CC) and machine learning (cs.LG) as possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
