The paper proposes a new method for on-policy learning that improves the handling of sparse reward signals by using past reward statistics. This method involves learning value functions with multi-critics supervision and a novel exploration mechanism called \"hot-wiring\". Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, since the paper applies the proposed method to Atari games and MuJoCo environments, it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
