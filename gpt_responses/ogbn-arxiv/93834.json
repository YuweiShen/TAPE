This topic falls under the field of game theory, which is typically categorized under cs.GT (Game Theory and Economics) on arXiv. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of regret minimization, which is a common technique in machine learning and optimization, suggesting that the paper could also be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the use of convexity-preserving operations, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
