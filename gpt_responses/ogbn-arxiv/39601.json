These problems are typically studied in the context of data structures and graph theory, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry) sub-categories. Moreover, the paper involves combinatorial techniques for solving these problems, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with the analysis of running times for deterministic algorithms, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
