The use of MMSE decision-feedback detection is a signal processing technique (cs.MM) commonly used in wireless communication systems. The paper also discusses the optimization of mutual information, which is a measure of the amount of information transmitted (cs.SI). The paper involves the design of a communication system, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents a closed-form solution for the optimization problem, which involves mathematical analysis and optimization techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
