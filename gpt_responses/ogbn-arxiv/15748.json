The paper also discusses the effectiveness of heuristics in decision making, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The behavioral experiment conducted in the paper involves analyzing data, which falls under the category of data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper examines how the structure of the voting environment affects the performance of heuristics, which is a topic of interest in social informatics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
