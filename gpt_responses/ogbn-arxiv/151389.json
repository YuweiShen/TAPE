This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The iterative refinement approach used in the proposed network also suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The use of publicly available databases and evaluation on a private dataset indicates the involvement of multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the high segmentation quality achieved without increasing the volume of datasets suggests the involvement of neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
