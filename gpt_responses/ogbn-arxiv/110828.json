The use of a likelihood function and innovations in initialization suggest that this paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The mention of motion of the observer and complex background geometry suggest that this paper may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category.
