The paper proposes a subgradient descent algorithm for learning orthogonal dictionaries, which is a popular approach in the literature. The paper also develops tools for characterizing landscapes of nonsmooth functions, which is relevant to the optimization of deep networks with nonsmooth activations. Based on these factors, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
