The paper focuses on the use of adversarial forgetting mechanism to induce amnesia to unwanted factors of data, which is a technique commonly used in deep learning. The paper also shows empirical results on a diverse collection of datasets and tasks, which suggests that the proposed framework is applicable to a wide range of problems. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
