The focus is on improving the quality of experience (QoE) of mobile clients, which involves video content caching and bitrate selection, falling under multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also deals with optimization and trade-offs between QoE and traffic reduction, which falls under distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents an optimization model and a low complexity algorithm, which involves information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
