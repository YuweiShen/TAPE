This involves developing rich state representations that combine supervised and unsupervised environment data, and using a cross-modal architecture to learn a joint low-dimensional embedding via Variational Auto Encoders. The paper also discusses the use of imitation learning with expert trajectories in a simulator to train the control policy. Based on these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is Robotics (cs.RO), followed by Computer Vision (cs.CV), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
