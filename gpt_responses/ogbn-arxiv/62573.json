Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SP (Signal Processing) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes low-complexity algorithms based on thresholding, which falls under the category of machine learning and optimization, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a likely sub-category as well. The paper also discusses the presence of group-structure in the target signal, which is a topic of interest in data science and network analysis, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
