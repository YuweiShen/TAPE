Therefore, it is likely to belong to the cs.AR (Architecture) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-categories. The paper also evaluates the impact on in-memory graph processing workloads, which suggests a possible fit for the cs.DB (Databases) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses NUMA-related performance characteristics, which could place it in the cs.OS (Operating Systems) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes fine-grained allocation policies to optimize traffic distribution between DRAM and NVM, which could be relevant to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
