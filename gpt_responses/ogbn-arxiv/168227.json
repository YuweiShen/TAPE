This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the automorphism group of these codes, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC). The explicit determination of the dual and minimum distance of these codes involves combinatorial methods (cs.DM). The study of Grassmann codes and their relatives is also related to computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
