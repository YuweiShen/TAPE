This problem is closely related to information retrieval (IR) and computer vision (CV), which are both sub-categories of arXiv CS. The paper also proposes a comparison of eleven popular hashing algorithms, which involves machine learning (LG), data structures (DS), and databases (DB). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IR, cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.DS, and cs.DB."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
