The paper also proposes a new method for exploiting shape information, which involves masking convolutional features, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves classification tasks, which is a common topic in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper demonstrates state-of-the-art results on benchmarks, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
