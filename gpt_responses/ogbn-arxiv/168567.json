This suggests that the paper may belong to the Game Theory sub-category.\n2. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper deals with a market where agents interact with each other, and the focus is on maximizing resource utilization. This aligns with the Multi-Agent Systems sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a Mean Field Game approach to model the market system, which involves learning and optimization. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Machine Learning sub-category.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with a market where agents interact with each other, and the goal is to maximize efficiency. This aligns with the Artificial Intelligence sub-category.\n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper mentions a case study on a proposed photovoltaic market, which involves distributed computing.
