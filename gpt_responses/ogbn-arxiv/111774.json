Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The use of block motion vectors (BMV) and bi-directional warping also suggests that this paper could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia), as well as cs.GR (Graphics) due to the use of image warping techniques. The paper also proposes a new scheme for feature propagation, which could be relevant to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and optimization techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
