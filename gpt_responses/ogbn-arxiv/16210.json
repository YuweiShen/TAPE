This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed method involves using an equation to relate the storage level to previous states and realized surplus/deficit of electricity. This can be seen as a form of machine learning or AI.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Similar to cs.AI, the proposed method involves using an equation to learn and predict future storage needs based on past data.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper deals with the management of energy storage in electricity grids, which is a topic that falls under the scope of computational engineering and science.\n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The use of energy storage in electricity grids is an emerging technology, and the proposed method can be seen as a contribution to this field."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
