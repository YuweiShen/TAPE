The use of proof rules to reduce variable domains suggests a connection to logic and proof theory, which are covered in cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The study of benchmarks and comparison of approaches is related to algorithm design and analysis, which falls under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the use of integer intervals and arithmetic constraints suggests a connection to discrete mathematics, which is covered in cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
