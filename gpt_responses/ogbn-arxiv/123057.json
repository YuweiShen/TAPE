It also involves formal definitions and complexity analysis, which are typical of logic (cs.LO). The use of rules and constraints suggests a connection with databases (cs.DB), while the analysis of natural language semantics is relevant to computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the use of graph homomorphism and the study of complexity classes are related to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
