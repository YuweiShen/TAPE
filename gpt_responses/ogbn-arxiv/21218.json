The paper also proposes a novel channel-gain monitoring scheme that leverages recent advances in compressive sensing (cs.SI) and interference processing in wireless communication (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the overhead of channel gain monitoring, which is related to distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
