The paper proposes a novel approach to improving the quality of generated text by using multiple discriminative models to guide the decoding process. This approach involves training a mixture of discriminative models, which could fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions using image features to improve the quality of generated text, which could fall under the category of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
