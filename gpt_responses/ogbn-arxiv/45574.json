Therefore, cs.MM (Multimedia) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves computer vision techniques for categorizing the video based on its features, which suggests cs.CV (Computer Vision) as another likely sub-category. The paper also deals with the practical constraints of encoding ladders, which suggests cs.GR (Graphics) as a possible sub-category.
