The authors propose a general framework for proving polynomial sample complexity bounds, which involves analyzing the structure of allocation rules and revenue functions, and this technique is relevant to both artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper is concerned with auctions and revenue maximization, which are topics in computational economics (cs.EC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
