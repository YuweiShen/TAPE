This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also involves matrix algebra and optimization techniques, which are relevant to the fields of numerical analysis (cs.NI) and mathematical optimization (cs.MA). Finally, the paper presents analytical results and validation through simulations, which are relevant to the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
