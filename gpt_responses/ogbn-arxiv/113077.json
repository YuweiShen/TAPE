The paper also discusses the moral assumptions underlying different notions of fairness, which could fall under the sub-category of cyber ethics (cs.CY). Additionally, the paper discusses fairness impossibility results, which could fall under the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a new family of measures for algorithmic fairness, which could fall under the sub-category of emerging technologies (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
