The proposed method involves the use of 3D convolutional neural networks, which is a popular technique in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of facial landmark points, which is a common technique in multimedia analysis (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses the evaluation of the proposed method using publicly available databases, which is a common practice in human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
