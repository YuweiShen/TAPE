This is a problem in communication systems and signal processing, which falls under the categories of information theory (cs.IT), communication (cs.COMM), and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of scattered pilot subcarriers for phase noise estimation, which is a technique commonly used in wireless networks (cs.NI). Finally, the paper proposes an optimization problem and a heuristic scheme for phase noise estimation, which involves mathematical modeling and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
