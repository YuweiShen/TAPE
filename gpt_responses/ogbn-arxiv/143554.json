The use of Thompson sampling, a popular algorithm for multi-armed bandit problems, suggests that this paper belongs to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The analysis of regret and optimization oracle also suggests that this paper could belong to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) or information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the use of probabilistically triggered arms and the semi-bandit feedback setting suggests that this paper could also belong to the sub-category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
