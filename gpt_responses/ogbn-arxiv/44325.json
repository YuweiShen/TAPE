Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper also proposes an explicit reasoning layer on top of neural network architectures, which involves probabilistic reasoning and knowledge representation, indicating that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the paper uses background ontological knowledge from word2vec and ConceptNet, suggesting that it may also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
