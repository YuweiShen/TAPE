The paper proposes a novel deep neural net for untangling identity and view features, which involves learning discriminative features (cs.LG) and encoding 3D face models from 2D images (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of multi-view images (cs.MM) and interpolation/prediction of unobserved viewpoints (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
