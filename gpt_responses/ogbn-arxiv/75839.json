These problems are commonly studied in computer science subfields such as data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational geometry (cs.CG), numerical analysis (cs.NA), and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper's focus on fast computation and parallelization further supports these subfields as likely categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
