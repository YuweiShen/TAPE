This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper deals with the analysis of educational data to predict students' performance, which can be considered as a form of computational science. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves the collection and preprocessing of data from multiple sources, which can be seen as a form of information retrieval. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper involves the preprocessing of data, which includes filling up missing values, transforming values, and attribute/variable selection. This falls under the domain of databases. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves the development of a predictive model using decision trees, which can be considered as a form of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
