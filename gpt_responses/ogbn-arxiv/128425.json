The paper specifically focuses on the noncoherent setting, which is a common scenario in wireless communication, and presents tools for high-SNR capacity analysis. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT and cs.COMM, followed by cs.NI, cs.SY, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
