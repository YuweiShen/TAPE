The proposed method, Deep Descriptor Transforming (DDT), is used for unsupervised object discovery and co-localization in images. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a new method for evaluating correlations of descriptors, which falls under the scope of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves multimedia analysis, which makes cs.MM (Multimedia) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of DDT for harvesting web images, which falls under the scope of cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
