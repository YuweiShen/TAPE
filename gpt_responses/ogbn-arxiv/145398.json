The proposed method involves using a segmentation-based network with a scale predictor to estimate the coarse location and scale of text instances in an image. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the use of a neural network for segmentation and prediction suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as text segmentation, which suggests that it may belong to the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves information retrieval (IR) techniques, such as text detection and localization, which suggests that it may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
