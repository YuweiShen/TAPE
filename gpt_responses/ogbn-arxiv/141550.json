Hence, cs.IR is another likely category for this paper.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes methods for summarization, which involves the use of machine learning and other AI techniques. Therefore, cs.AI is another possible category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed methods involve the combination of single-document summaries using a hierarchical approach, which can be seen as a machine learning task. Hence, cs.LG is another possible category.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a method for combining single-document summaries hierarchically, which involves the use of algorithms and data structures. Therefore, cs.DS is another possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
