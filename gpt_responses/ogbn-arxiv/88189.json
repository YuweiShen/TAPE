This falls under the category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR) as it deals with improving the effectiveness and efficiency of web search. Additionally, the use of ontology and intelligent agents suggests a focus on Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Database (cs.DB) technologies. The paper also mentions the analysis of snippets, which is a common technique in Natural Language Processing (cs.CL). Finally, the proposed support for image and news search suggests a potential focus on Cybersecurity (cs.CY) as these types of searches may involve sensitive or private information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
