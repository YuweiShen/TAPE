The paper also introduces an Attention Partial Module (APM) operator and a differentiable auto-data augmentation method, which are related to attention mechanisms (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of parallel pyramid structures and computational complexity also suggests a potential fit for multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
