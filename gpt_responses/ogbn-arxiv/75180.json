This falls under the broad category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also mentions the use of external knowledge bases such as WordNet and Wikidata, which are commonly used in natural language processing and machine learning tasks, indicating a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and database systems (cs.DB). Finally, the paper discusses the application of the proposed system in spacecraft development, which suggests a possible connection to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
