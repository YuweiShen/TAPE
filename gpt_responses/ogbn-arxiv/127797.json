The paper also provides characterizations of these graphs, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The study of canonical orders of maximally planar graphs is also a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper discusses the conversion of contact systems of L's to equivalent ones with equilateral L's, which is a topic in discrete structures (cs.DS). The paper also draws connections to Schnyder realizers and homothetic triangle contact representations of maximally planar graphs, which are topics in graph theory (cs.GT) and computational geometry (cs.CG), respectively. Finally, the paper discusses the potential for efficient algorithms, which is a topic in computational complexity and algorithms (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
