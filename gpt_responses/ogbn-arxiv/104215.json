The paper also proposes a novel attention module, which is a common technique used in machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also discusses the use of neural networks for image harmonization, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper includes experiments and evaluations of the proposed method, which involves visual comparisons and metrics, which are common in graphics (cs.GR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
