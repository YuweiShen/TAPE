The paper proposes a novel approach using tensor-based robust principal component analysis (TenRPCA) with total variation regularization to enhance spatio-temporal continuity of foregrounds and model spatio-temporal correlations of video background. This approach is motivated by compressive imaging and has applications in video surveillance, teleconferencing, and 3D modeling. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
