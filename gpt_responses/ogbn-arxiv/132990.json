The experiments are conducted on image datasets, such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN, which are commonly used in computer vision research. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses the architecture choice and training strategies, which are relevant to cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
