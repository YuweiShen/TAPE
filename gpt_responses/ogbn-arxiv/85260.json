The method involves developing a stochastic variational inference method for Gaussian process (GP) preference learning. The paper also discusses how the Bayesian approach enables more effective active learning, thereby reducing the amount of data required to identify convincing arguments for new users and domains. The paper's focus on Bayesian methods, preference learning, and active learning suggests that it could belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
