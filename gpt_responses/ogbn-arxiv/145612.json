While the paper is primarily about numerical optimization, it could potentially be classified under cs.OH due to its broad scope. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper mentions support for constrained optimization, which is relevant to the field of control systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
