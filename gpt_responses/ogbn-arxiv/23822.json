This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel deep learning framework, which involves training a convolutional neural network (cs.LG) and using fuzzy filtering techniques (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the limitations of unimodal biometric systems and the need for multimodal systems, which involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper addresses issues such as spoofing and noise, which are relevant to the computer security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
