The paper also discusses the use of deformable convolutions, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Additionally, the paper deals with motion blur and occlusion, which are common challenges in multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper discusses the use of a simpler design for video object detection, which could be relevant to robotics (cs.RO) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
