The use of linear programming and dual solutions is a common technique in information theory (cs.IT) and optimization (cs.DS). The paper also involves the construction of explicit polynomials, which is a topic in algebraic geometry and representation theory (cs.SC). Finally, the paper re-proves several Markov-type inequalities, which are important in approximation theory and have applications throughout theoretical computer science (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
