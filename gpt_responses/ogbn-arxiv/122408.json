This falls under the domain of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed scheme is applicable to wireless networks where energy harvesting is possible, and involves the use of artificial noise to enhance security. This makes it relevant to the networking and internet architecture sub-category. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper involves the design and optimization of a hybrid time-switching/power-splitting scheme for OFDM systems, which can be viewed as a control problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): OFDM is a widely used modulation technique in multimedia communication systems, and the proposed scheme can potentially enhance the security and energy efficiency of such systems. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper proposes a scheme for secure transmission of data using artificial noise, which falls under the domain of cryptography and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
