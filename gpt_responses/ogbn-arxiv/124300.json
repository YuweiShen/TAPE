The use of noisy mirror descent and the focus on achieving optimal rates suggest that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.IT (Information Theory). The mention of Lipschitz continuity and the use of first-order stochastic oracle suggest that the paper may also be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the mention of anytime utility and privacy guarantees suggests that the paper may also be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
