The use of deformable kernels involves learning the sampling locations and kernel weights, which is a machine learning task and falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of trilinear sampling and regularization, which are graphics-related techniques and fall under the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
