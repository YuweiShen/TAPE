This work falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) as it deals with the development of a tool for understanding and debugging machine learning models. Additionally, it involves the use of sequential data (audio) which falls under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SD) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the need for transparency and interpretability in deep learning models, which falls under the sub-category of natural language processing (cs.CL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
