The theory of D numbers is a generalization of Dempster-Shafer theory, which is a well-known theory in the field of decision making and information fusion (cs.DS). The proposed total uncertainty measure is based on belief intervals, which are related to interval analysis and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper also discusses some basic properties of the proposed measure, which are related to set theory and information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
