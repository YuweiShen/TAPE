It specifically focuses on no-signaling provers, which are related to quantum information (cs.QI) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also uses algorithms and computational geometry techniques (cs.CG) to construct a fast parallel algorithm. Finally, the paper involves approximation algorithms, which are related to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
