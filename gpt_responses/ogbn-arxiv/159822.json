The paper also discusses the impact of non-uniform hardware on different workloads, which falls under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR). Additionally, the paper examines the efficiency of different database deployment strategies, which is related to operating systems (cs.OS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper argues in favor of shared-nothing deployments that take advantage of fast on-chip communication, which is related to parallel and distributed computing (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
