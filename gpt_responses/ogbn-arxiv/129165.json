The paper also discusses aggregation functions and their efficiency, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of matrix power normalization and its connection to prior work on minimizing interference is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the use of sketching to compute low dimensional space, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
