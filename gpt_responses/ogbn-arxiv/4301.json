The use of atomic norm balls to describe the set of loss vectors is a common technique in optimization and signal processing, which suggests the paper may also be relevant to the information theory and signal processing communities. The paper also discusses structured settings such as low-rank and sparse vectors, which are topics of interest in data science and optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SI (Signal Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
