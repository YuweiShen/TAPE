The proposed approach involves a low-rank approach to recover the original information, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the use of quotient manifold geometry and Riemannian trust-region algorithm, which are topics related to computational geometry and numerical analysis (cs.SI, cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
