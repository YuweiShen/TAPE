It also analyzes the effectiveness of known defenses against Spectre attacks. Therefore, cs.CR is the most likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n2. cs.AR (Architecture) - The paper discusses the use of speculative execution, a feature of modern microprocessors, and how it can be exploited to exfiltrate sensitive data across protection boundaries. This makes cs.AR a likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper discusses the construction of proof of concept attacks and analyzes additional types of attacks on the kernel or across address spaces. This makes cs.SE a possible sub-category for this paper.\n\n4. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper discusses the use of the return stack buffer (RSB), a common predictor structure in modern CPUs used to predict return addresses. This makes cs.PL a possible sub-category for this paper.\n\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the vulnerability of modern microprocessors to Spectre-class attacks and the need for future system developers to consider this vulnerability in developing defenses against speculation attacks. This makes cs.SY a possible sub-category for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
