This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) or Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions that the proposed filter can be applied to other types of signals defined on mesh surfaces, such as texture colors, which suggests that it may also belong to the Computer Graphics (cs.CG), Multimedia (cs.MM), or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
