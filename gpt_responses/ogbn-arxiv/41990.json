This could be relevant to programming languages that deal with random number generation. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new type of pseudorandom number generator and a parameter-set generator, which could be relevant to software engineering for applications that require efficient and high-quality random number generation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
