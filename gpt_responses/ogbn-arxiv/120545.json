Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses statistical channel models and capacity studies, which are related to information theory, making cs.IT (Information Theory) another likely category. The use of millimeter-wave frequencies and multielement antenna arrays also suggests cs.MM (Multimedia), while the discussion of beamforming and spatial multiplexing suggests cs.AR (Hardware Architecture). Finally, the paper discusses various technologies that can be leveraged in the millimeter-wave context, which suggests cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
