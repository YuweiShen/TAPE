This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method involves the use of a neural network, which is a common tool in the field of neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the feasibility of the proposed method across various appliances, which suggests a systems and control perspective (cs.SY). Finally, the paper compares the performance of the proposed method with two benchmark methods, which indicates a signal processing perspective (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
