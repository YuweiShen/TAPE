It could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as the evaluation of automatic summaries is a key task in this field. Additionally, the use of keyphrases and their lemma form in the matching process suggests a possible connection to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the application of the system to evaluate different summaries of Arabic multi-document data set presented at TAC2011 suggests a possible connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
