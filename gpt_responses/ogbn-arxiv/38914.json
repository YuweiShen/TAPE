This involves the use of multi-antenna techniques and beam scanning to maximize outage sum rates. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the use of NOMA transmission, which is a topic of interest in information theory. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the use of drones as base stations for communication networks, which is a topic of interest in networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the use of multi-antenna techniques and beam scanning to maximize outage sum rates, which are topics of interest in systems and control. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the use of drones as base stations for communication networks, which can involve multimedia applications. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly deal with cryptography and security, but the use of drones as base stations for communication networks can raise security concerns, making this a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
