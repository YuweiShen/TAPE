This falls under the purview of data structures and algorithms. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of tensor decomposition and eigenvector-based techniques for hotspot detection can be considered as an application of artificial intelligence. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Tensor decomposition and eigenvector-based techniques are commonly used in machine learning, and the proposed algorithm can be seen as a machine learning approach to hotspot detection. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Hotspot detection is a common problem in social and information networks, and the proposed algorithm can be applied in this context. \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory): The use of tensor decomposition and eigenvector-based techniques can be seen as an application of information theory in the analysis of spatiotemporal data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
