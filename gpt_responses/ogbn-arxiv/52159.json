This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.MM) as it involves compression and estimation. The paper also discusses the distortion measures used in the problem, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI). The use of achievable schemes and single-letter expressions suggests a focus on algorithms and complexity (cs.DS). Finally, the paper derives closed-form expressions for specific cases, which is related to statistics and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
