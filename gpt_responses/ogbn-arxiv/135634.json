This makes it likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method, which suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The real applications in biomedical and medical image registration indicate that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the low computational cost of the proposed method, which suggests that it could belong to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
