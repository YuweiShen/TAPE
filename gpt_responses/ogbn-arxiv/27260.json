Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the complexity of the construction method, which could fall under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The analysis of the block error probability could be considered under cs.SI (Signal Processing) or cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
