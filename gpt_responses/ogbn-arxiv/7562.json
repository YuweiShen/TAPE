The paper proposes a new approach to mitigate the issue of unstable learning dynamics, which is a common problem in reinforcement learning, and this approach is model-agnostic and can be applied to various tasks, indicating that it falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on a suite of challenging benchmark tasks involving continuous control of simulated robots, which suggests that it may also fall under the category of computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
