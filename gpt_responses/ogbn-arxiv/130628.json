The paper presents an automated fact-checking platform that retrieves relevant textual evidence from a document collection and predicts whether each piece of evidence supports or refutes the claim. This involves techniques such as natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), followed by cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
