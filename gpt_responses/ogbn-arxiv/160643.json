The paper specifically focuses on pre-processing textual information, which involves language features and character tri-grams, indicating that it could also belong to the cs.CL (Computation and Language) category. The paper also mentions classification and regression techniques, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG).
