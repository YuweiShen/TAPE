The concept of edge unfoldings is related to graph theory and discrete mathematics (cs.DS, cs.DM). The paper also discusses the fraction of edge unfoldings that avoid overlap, which can be seen as a combinatorial optimization problem (cs.GT). Finally, the paper may be relevant to the study of computational complexity (cs.CC) as it shows that the problem of finding nonoverlapping edge unfoldings becomes increasingly difficult as the number of vertices increases."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
