Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper proposes a lightweight network for SISR, which involves designing novel local fusion blocks and adaptive weighted multi-scale modules. This suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on commonly used datasets, which indicates that it may also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
