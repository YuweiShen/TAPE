This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning sub-category.\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper mentions Web crawling as an example of synchronization bandits, which is a common task in Information Retrieval. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Retrieval sub-category.\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new variant of the multi-armed bandit problem, which requires the development of new algorithms. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms sub-category.\n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions an adversarial regret bound for the proposed algorithm, which is a measure of its robustness against attacks. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Cryptography and Security sub-category.\n5. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper involves the study of discrete structures such as multi-armed bandits and synchronization bandits, which are common topics in Discrete Mathematics.
