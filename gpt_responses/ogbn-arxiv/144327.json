The use of variational Bayesian inference techniques is also a common approach in these fields. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also deals with missing link prediction, which is a common problem in network analysis, suggesting cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as likely sub-categories.
