This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the sample efficiency of these methods, which is a common concern in reinforcement learning and optimization, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also mentions stability, which is a concern in robotics and control, suggesting that it could belong to cs.RO (Robotics) or cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
