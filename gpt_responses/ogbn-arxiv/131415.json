The paper specifically focuses on policy-gradient approaches, which are commonly used in reinforcement learning, and proposes a new method that eliminates the need for warm-start training and sample variance reduction. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.LG and cs.AI, followed by cs.CL, cs.CV, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
