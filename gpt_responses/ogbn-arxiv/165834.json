The paper also proposes axioms that risk metrics in robotics applications should satisfy, which involves concepts of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the importance of ensuring safety for robots operating under uncertainty, which is a key concern in the field of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the pitfalls of commonly used risk metrics in robotics, which involves concepts of computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
