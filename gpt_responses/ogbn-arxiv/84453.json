The system relies on a taxonomy of keywords to describe papers and reviewers' competences, which suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) or Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-categories. The paper also mentions automatic conflict of interest detection based on institutional affiliation, co-authorship, and previous co-authorship, which suggests that it may also belong to the Databases (cs.DB) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of similarity measures to calculate how semantically close non-matching keywords are, which suggests that it may belong to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions load balancing among reviewers, which suggests that it may also belong to the Digital Libraries (cs.DL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
