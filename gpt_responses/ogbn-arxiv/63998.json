This makes cs.CV the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves retrieving information about cloud coverage and movement from sky images, which could fall under cs.IR.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper may involve the use of machine learning algorithms for accurate rainfall nowcast.\n4. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper may involve the use of graphics techniques for visualizing the sky images and the detected rainfall onset.\n5. cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper may involve the development of software for processing and analyzing the sky images."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
