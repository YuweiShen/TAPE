The paper also introduces a new type of ESN with a reservoir of product nodes, which is a novel approach to neural network architecture and could be of interest to researchers in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the performance of the product ESN on standard benchmarks for chaotic prediction tasks, which is a topic commonly studied in the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category.
