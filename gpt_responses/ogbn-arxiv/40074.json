It proposes an algorithm to decouple the human reporting bias from the correct visually grounded labels. The paper focuses on image classification and image captioning, which are subfields of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The algorithm proposed in the paper involves modeling the noise in the annotations, which is a machine learning task (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of large datasets such as MS COCO and Yahoo Flickr 100M, which are commonly used in multimedia retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia analysis (cs.MM). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.IR, and cs.MM, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
