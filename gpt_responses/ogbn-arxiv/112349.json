This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including:\n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category covers natural language processing and computational linguistics, which are relevant to the text analysis component of the proposed model.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category covers search and retrieval of information, which is relevant to the patent querying and dataset creation process.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers various aspects of machine learning, which is the overarching methodology used in the proposed model.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers a broad range of topics related to AI, including natural language processing and machine learning, which are relevant to the proposed model.\n- cs.DL (Deep Learning): This sub-category specifically focuses on deep learning, which is the main technique used in the proposed model."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
