The proposed method is also applicable to signal recovery problems, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the practical application of the algorithm in MIMO detection, which is a topic in machine learning and pattern recognition (cs.LG). The algorithm can be applied to a wide range of signal recovery problems, including deconvolution, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper also discusses the convergence rate of the algorithm, which is a topic in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
