The paper also introduces a new method for learning to detect objects, which involves optimizing over all sub-windows, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of linear models such as HOG and bag-of-visual-word models, which are common in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the performance gains achieved on publicly available datasets, which is relevant to computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
