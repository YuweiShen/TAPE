The paper specifically focuses on fine-tuning a pre-trained artifact removal network, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG). The compression objective used in the paper is related to information theory (cs.IT), and the use of pruning and quantization is relevant to neural network compression (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
