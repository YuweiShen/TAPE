The problem is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem and solved using the Lyapunov optimization framework. The paper also leverages a Gaussian process regression-based channel prediction method to learn and track the wireless channel. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel approach to improve the accuracy of federated learning, which is a machine learning technique. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the problem of resource allocation and scheduling in wireless networks, which is a topic of interest in information theory. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on improving the performance of federated learning over wireless networks, which is a topic of interest in networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper formulates the problem as a stochastic optimization problem and solves it using the Lyapunov optimization framework, which are techniques commonly used in systems and control. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel approach to improve the accuracy of federated learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
