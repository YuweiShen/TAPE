The paper also discusses the concept of full abstraction, which is related to logic and semantics (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of formal semantics as a guide for software development tools, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE). The paper specifically focuses on the family of modern functional logic languages, which could fall under the sub-category of functional programming (cs.FL). Finally, the paper discusses the properties of the CRWL semantic framework, which could be related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
