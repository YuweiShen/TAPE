The classification of the different types of sources and the algorithms for extracting randomness involve computational complexity theory (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the error rates and the limitations of extraction, which are related to cryptography (cs.CR) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
