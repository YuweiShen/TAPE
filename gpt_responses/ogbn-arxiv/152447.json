This topic is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG), as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the reduction of computational cost and number of parameters, which is related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
