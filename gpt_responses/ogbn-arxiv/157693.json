This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The paper also mentions the Shannon entropy, which is a concept from information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper discusses the speed of transmission of hidden information, which could be related to multimedia (cs.MM) or computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper mentions computational limitations on steganography, which could be related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
