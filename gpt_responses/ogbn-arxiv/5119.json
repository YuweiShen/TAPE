This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to the Game Theory sub-category.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents an algorithm for finding the necessary and sufficient initial ratio for guaranteeing a certain outcome with probability 1, and also shows a simple FPTAS for DAGs. These are algorithmic contributions that suggest the paper could also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses strategies for maximizing expected outcomes, which is a common theme in AI research. Additionally, the paper's focus on modeling settings where effort needs to be invested in an ongoing and stateful manner is also relevant to AI research.\n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with combinatorial games on graphs, which is a topic that falls under Discrete Mathematics.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper presents an FPTAS for DAGs, which is a complexity result that could be of interest to the Computational Complexity sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
