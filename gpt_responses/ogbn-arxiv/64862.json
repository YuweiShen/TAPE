The paper also discusses deep learning-based classification models, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions loss re-weighting and data re-sampling, which are common techniques in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses benchmarks like ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist, which are datasets commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
