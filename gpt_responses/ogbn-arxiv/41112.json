Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper proposes novel methods for normalization and geometry-aware self-attention, which are relevant to natural language processing and machine learning, indicating that it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
