The paper also discusses consensus and marginal swarm stability, which are topics related to multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The Laplacian spectrum is used to analyze the network topology, which is a common tool in the graph theory (cs.DS) sub-category. The paper also presents numerical instances to verify the theoretical results, which is related to the numerical analysis (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the interactive dynamics of nearest neighbouring vertices, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
