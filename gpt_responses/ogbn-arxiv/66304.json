The proposed approach involves using a variant of Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which is a popular technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the challenges of extrapolating implicit requirements to data points beyond the training set, which is a common problem in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper proposes a novel framework for testing, which can be considered a software engineering problem (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
