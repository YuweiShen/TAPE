The use of neural networks and polynomial fitting also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also involves experimentation and analysis of results, which could fall under the categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
