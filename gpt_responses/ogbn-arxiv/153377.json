The paper also discusses the use of model checking, which is a technique commonly used in computer security (cs.CR) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper proposes a new tool called Plankton, which is a software tool (cs.PL) that uses symbolic partitioning and model checking to verify network configurations. Finally, the paper discusses various optimization techniques used in Plankton, which is a topic related to logic and verification (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
