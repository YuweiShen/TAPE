This category is the most likely fit for the paper.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper is based on linear logic, an expressive logical system where logical facts can be consumed. The paper also discusses the integration of classical and linear logic in LM. This category is also a likely fit.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper focuses on programming graph-based algorithms in a declarative fashion, and discusses the use of a graph data structure in LM. This category is a possible fit.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper mentions that LM programs are naturally concurrent because facts are partitioned by nodes of a graph data structure, and computation is performed at the node level while communication happens between connected nodes. This category is a possible fit.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of LM for programming graph-based algorithms, which are commonly used in AI applications such as knowledge representation and reasoning, planning, and natural language processing. This category is a possible fit."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
