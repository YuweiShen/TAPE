The focus is on developing a sample-efficient algorithm that can learn policies quickly and transfer well to hardware. This topic is closely related to robotics (cs.RO), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), control systems (cs.SY), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
