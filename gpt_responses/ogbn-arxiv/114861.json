Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.PL (Programming Languages). However, the paper also discusses the practical application development of knowledge-based systems, which falls under cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions experimental results, which could be related to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
