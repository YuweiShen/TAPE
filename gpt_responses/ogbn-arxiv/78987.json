This falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms. \n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - Degree distribution is a fundamental property of real-world graphs, and the paper deals with approximating it for streaming graphs. This is a relevant topic in the field of social and information networks. \n3. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper introduces a new estimator of infrequent degrees using truncated geometric random variables and a new notion of Relative Hausdorff distance between tailed histograms. These concepts are related to information theory. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper uses a new estimator and a new distance measure, which are both related to statistical learning. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper deals with approximating the degree distribution of a large streaming graph with small storage, which is a relevant problem in computational science and engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
