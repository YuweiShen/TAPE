The paper also discusses the use of signal processing techniques, which could fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. The problem of signature verification also involves aspects of security and cryptography, which could fall under the cryptography (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning techniques for feature learning is a popular area of research in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
