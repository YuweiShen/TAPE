The use of compressive whisk-broom hyperspectral imagers suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (MM) and information theory (IT). The paper discusses the use of distinct measurement matrices for different pixels, which suggests that it may be relevant to machine learning (LG) and information retrieval (IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
