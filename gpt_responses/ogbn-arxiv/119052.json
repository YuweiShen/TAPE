This topic is closely related to mathematical logic (cs.LO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as many-valued logic is used in fuzzy logic and uncertainty reasoning. The paper also discusses the semantics of the new calculus, which falls under the category of proof theory (cs.PL) and logic in computer science (cs.LG). Finally, the paper presents a new set of sequent axioms for many-valued logic connectives, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC) as it deals with the complexity of logical systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
