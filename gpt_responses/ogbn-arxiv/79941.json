Therefore, it is likely to belong to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a new technique to mitigate CSRF attacks, which involves software engineering and system implementation, making cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) also likely sub-categories. The paper may also fall under cs.CY (Computers and Society) as it discusses the security of widely used online services.
