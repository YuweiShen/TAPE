Object detection is a subfield of computer vision (cs.CV) and the toolbox includes training and inference codes, which suggests machine learning (cs.LG) is also relevant. The paper also mentions benchmarking different methods and hyper-parameters, which is a common practice in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The toolbox is developed by MMLab, which is known for their work in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper mentions the project being under active development, which suggests natural language processing (cs.CL) may also be relevant in the future."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
