This is a core topic in data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Expanders are important in the study of social and information networks, as they capture the notion of connectivity and robustness. The paper's focus on finding the largest induced expander in a graph is relevant to this sub-category.\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): Expanders have connections to geometric embeddings and spectral graph theory, which are topics in computational geometry. The paper's use of spectral expansion and semidefinite programming relaxation may be of interest to researchers in this sub-category.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper's use of spectral expansion and semidefinite programming relaxation may also be of interest to researchers in information theory, as these techniques have applications in coding theory and communication networks.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper's use of semidefinite programming relaxation is a common technique in machine learning, particularly in the area of convex optimization. The paper's focus on finding the largest induced expander in a graph may also have applications in machine learning, such as in clustering and community detection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
