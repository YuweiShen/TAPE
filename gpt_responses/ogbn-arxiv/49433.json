The approach leverages cost-efficient, paper printable artificial landmarks, which involves computer vision techniques and fiducial detection, placing it under computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The system is used for control, motion planning, navigation, interaction with the environment, or verification, which falls under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also discusses the fusion of visual and inertial data, which involves machine learning techniques, placing it under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper provides an open-source implementation and various datasets, which involves artificial intelligence techniques, placing it under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
