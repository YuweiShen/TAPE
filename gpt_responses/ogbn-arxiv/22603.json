This is a core topic in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a new network access scheme that combines PNC and MUD to improve network throughput. This is a networking topic. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a low-complexity symbol-level NCMA decoder that, together with MIMO, can substantially alleviate the performance degradation induced by relative phase offset. This is a control systems topic. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of high-order modulations up to 16-QAM, which is commonly used in multimedia applications. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not directly discuss cryptography or security, but the proposed NCMA system could have implications for secure communication in wireless networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
