The paper proposes a new approach called riffled independence, which addresses these challenges and allows for efficient inference with partial ranking data. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
