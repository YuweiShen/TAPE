This involves combining distributional information about how the classes are used in software with corpus statistics on the distribution of contexts in which the classes appear in text. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Software Engineering (cs.SE), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
