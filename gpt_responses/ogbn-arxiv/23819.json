This falls under the category of natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also proposes a novel framework that uses neural networks to generate executable logical forms from NL explanations, which involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves the use of semantic parsing, which is a subfield of natural language processing and artificial intelligence. The experiments conducted in the paper involve training and evaluating models, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
