The proposed method involves evolving the architecture of the network, which falls under the category of neural evolution (cs.NE) and evolutionary computation (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of shortcut connections is a technique commonly used in deep reinforcement learning (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
