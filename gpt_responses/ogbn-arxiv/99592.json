This falls under the scope of cryptography and security.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper proposes a framework for publishing perturbed datasets while maintaining high data utility. This involves database management and falls under the scope of databases.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with social media data and proposes a mechanism to protect user privacy while publishing social media data. This falls under the scope of social and information networks.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with text-based user-linkage attack and proposes a novel notion of $\\epsilon$-text indistinguishability to thwart the attack. This falls under the scope of information retrieval.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper deals with user privacy in social media data publishing, which is a topic related to the intersection of computers and society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
