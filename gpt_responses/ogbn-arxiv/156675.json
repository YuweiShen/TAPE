This makes cs.RO the most likely category for this paper.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an active sampling scheme to compute a probabilistic upper bound on the distance between the closed-loop actual system and the learned model. This involves the use of machine learning techniques, making cs.LG a likely category for this paper.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the validation of a learned model against the actual physical system, which involves the use of control theory concepts. This makes cs.SY a likely category for this paper.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a framework for validating data-driven models, which involves the use of probabilistic reasoning and active sampling. This makes cs.AI a likely category for this paper.\n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a methodology for validating data-driven models before deploying them to design a controller for the actual system. This involves the development of software tools and techniques, making cs.SE a possible category for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
