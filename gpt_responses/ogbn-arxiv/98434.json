This involves machine-machine communication and the use of a sequence-to-sequence question reformulation model. The paper focuses on the language learned by the agent and how it adapts to increase the quality of the answers returned. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the arXiv CS sub-categories of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
