The paper also discusses transfer learning and the use of a novel explanation method, which are both relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the importance of understanding the nature of features in the base model, which relates to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on a dataset of facial expressions, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
