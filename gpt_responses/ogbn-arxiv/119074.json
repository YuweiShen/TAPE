The use of probabilistic methods and uncertainty handling also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). The problem of making decisions with incomplete information is relevant to control systems (cs.SY) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the mention of leg nets suggests a connection to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
