The paper also discusses the impact of spatial node distributions on network performance, which falls under the category of spatial information (cs.SI). The use of MMSE receivers is a technique related to signal processing (cs.SP) and the paper also discusses the convergence of the SIR, which is a topic related to probability and statistics (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
