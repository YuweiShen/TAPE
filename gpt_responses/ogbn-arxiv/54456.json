The paper also proposes a novel approach to crafting physical-world adversarial examples, which involves transferring large perturbations into customized styles, a technique that falls under the umbrella of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed approach using image classifiers, which is a common task in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
