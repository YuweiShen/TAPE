This is a problem that falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves training a network to predict future frames. The use of convolutional kernels also suggests that the paper may fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper's focus on developing a robust approach suggests that it may also fall under neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
