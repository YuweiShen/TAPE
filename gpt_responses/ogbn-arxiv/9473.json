The experiments conducted in the paper are primarily focused on image and document classification datasets, which are typically associated with computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) subfields. Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of network architecture and regularization techniques on calibration, which are relevant topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) subfields. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CL, and cs.NE, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
