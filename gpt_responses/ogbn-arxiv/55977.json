This involves formulating candidates for impossibility theorems in propositional logic and searching for them using a SAT solver. This approach involves elements of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), logic (cs.LO), game theory (cs.GT), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
