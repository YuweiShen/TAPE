The method also aims to improve interpretability, which is a concern in the field of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The proposed method involves attention mechanisms, which are commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV), but can also be applied to healthcare data. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on real-world datasets, which involves data management and analysis (cs.DB) and clinical informatics (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
