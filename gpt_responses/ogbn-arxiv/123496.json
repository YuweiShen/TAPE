This falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and security and privacy (cs.CR) in computer science. The method involves image processing techniques such as discrete Fourier transform (DFT), discrete cosine transform (DCT), and Arnold transform (AT), which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV), information retrieval (cs.IR), and machine learning (cs.LG). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.MM and cs.CR, followed by cs.CV, cs.IR, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
