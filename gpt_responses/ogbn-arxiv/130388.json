The proposed method involves clustering malware based on their attacking capabilities reflected in their network traffic, which involves the use of machine learning techniques such as sequential feature modeling and visualization-based cluster evaluation. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the use of network traffic data implies that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper proposes a whitebox method for malware analysis, which involves the use of visualization-based cluster evaluation, suggesting that it may also be relevant to the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
