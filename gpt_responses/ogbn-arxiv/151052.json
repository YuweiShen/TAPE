The paper also mentions interactive systems such as cameras, robots, and instant opinion polls, which are often studied in the field of HCI.\n2. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses the cost and performance trade-offs of realtime crowdsourcing, which is a topic that is relevant to the societal impact of computer systems.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper discusses the management of a small, fast-reacting worker pool, which can be seen as a social network of workers. The paper also proposes techniques such as shared retainer pools, which involve sharing resources among workers, and push notifications, which involve disseminating information through a network.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes an algorithm for minimizing cost subject to performance requirements, which is a topic that falls under the domain of algorithms and data structures.\n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper discusses the management of a worker pool, which can be seen as a distributed system. The paper also proposes techniques such as shared retainer pools, which involve distributing resources among workers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
