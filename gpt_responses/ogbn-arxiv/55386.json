The paper focuses on improving the efficiency and noise-tolerance of RL algorithms, which are key concerns in the field of machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses control problems, which suggests that it may belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
