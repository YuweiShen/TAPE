The use of computational and economic results suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The paper discusses the design of combinatorial auctions, which involves decision-making and optimization, making it relevant to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also discusses social welfare maximization, which is a topic in the cs.EC (Economics and Computation) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of algorithms and oracle access, which are topics in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
