The paper also proposes a novel approach to designing residual connections, which is a common technique in deep learning and could be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper evaluates its approach on multiple datasets, which could also make it relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
