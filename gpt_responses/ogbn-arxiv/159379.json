The paper also discusses the evaluation of state-of-the-art approaches, which suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of motion capture systems and synchronization of sensors suggests a potential focus on control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
