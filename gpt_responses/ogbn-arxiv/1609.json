The use of secrecy metrics and the focus on quasi-static fading channels suggest that the paper is likely to be categorized under Information Theory (cs.IT), Cryptography and Security (cs.CR), or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). The mention of designing secure communication systems suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) subfield. Finally, the mention of error probabilities suggests that the paper may also be relevant to Multimedia (cs.MM) subfield, which deals with the transmission and processing of multimedia data over networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
