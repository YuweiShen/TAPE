The use of metadata and user feedback to improve the dataset and classification results suggests a potential overlap with multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. The evaluation of different techniques for improving classification results, such as transfer learning and PCA compression, indicates a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the fact that the application is designed for smartphones and involves user interaction suggests a potential link to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
