The paper also discusses the potential of exploiting internal symmetries to improve solution finding, which is relevant to algorithms and complexity (cs.CC) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the two benchmark domains used in the paper, Van der Waerden numbers and graceful graphs, are both topics in discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
