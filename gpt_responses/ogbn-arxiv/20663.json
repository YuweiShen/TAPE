It also involves combinatorial aspects such as characterizing optimal graphs and developing inclusion relationships with other graph classes, which are typical of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.GT). The paper also presents upper bounds on the edge density of planar graphs, which is related to the study of sparse graphs and their properties (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the regular structure of optimal planar graphs, which is relevant to the study of symmetry and regularity in graphs and networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
