The paper also discusses applications in multiband communications, finite rate of innovation signals, and sparse harmonic tones, which are relevant to the Multidimensional Signal Processing (cs.MM) and Sampling Theory (cs.SI) categories. Finally, the paper emphasizes a hardware-oriented viewpoint, which could also make it relevant to the Embedded Systems (cs.EM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
