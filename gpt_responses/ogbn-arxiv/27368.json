The use of end-to-end learning and the incorporation of 2D pose information also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The focus on joint positions and relative positions also suggests that it could belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the use of image features and the evaluation on a dataset suggests that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
