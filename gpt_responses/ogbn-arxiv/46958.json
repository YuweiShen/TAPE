Therefore, cs.SE (Software Engineering) is the most likely category. The paper also uses techniques from information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP) to detect near duplicates, so cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) are also likely categories. Additionally, the paper deals with managing and analyzing large amounts of data, which could fall under cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.DL (Digital Libraries)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
