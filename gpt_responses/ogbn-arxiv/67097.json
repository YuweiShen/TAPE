The paper also explores the challenges and trade-offs in terms of application design and programming frameworks, which is related to Software Engineering (cs.SE). The inclusion of IoT applications for coordination control of UAV swarms suggests a focus on Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) and Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the performance predictability of microservices in real deployments, which is related to Programming Languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
