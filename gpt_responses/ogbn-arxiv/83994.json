The proposed method, PEARL, uses reinforcement learning and feature engineering, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the adaptation for rejection of stochastic disturbances, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the experiments involve multi-agent systems and aerial cargo delivery, which are topics in multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
