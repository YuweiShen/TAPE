This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.LG: The paper discusses training a model from scratch, which involves learning a policy through trial and error. This falls under the scope of machine learning. \n- cs.CV: The paper discusses using partial observations of the environment from an egocentric perspective, which involves processing visual information. This falls under the scope of computer vision. \n- cs.RO: The paper discusses navigation and obstacle avoidance in a simulated environment, which involves robotics and control. This falls under the scope of robotics. \n- cs.GR: The paper discusses the use of graphics and visualization to analyze the learned policy and agent behavior. This falls under the scope of computer graphics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
