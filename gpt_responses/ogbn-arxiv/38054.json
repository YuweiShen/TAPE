It also involves the use of shared randomness and interactive protocols. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). It could also belong to cs.CC (Computational Complexity) as it involves the study of protocols and communication complexity. The use of rounds and expected communication also suggests a possible fit for cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also involves probability and statistics, which could make it relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
