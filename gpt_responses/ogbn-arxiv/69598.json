The attacks involve algebraic techniques and the use of metrics such as the rank and Hamming metrics, which are also relevant to coding theory (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper discusses the security of the schemes in terms of their parameters, which could be considered a topic in cybersecurity (cs.CY) or security and privacy (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
