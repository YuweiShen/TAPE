The proposed method uses deep neural networks (LG) to estimate optical flow and camera motion, and to fuse depth information from multiple target frames. The paper also introduces tools to generate photorealistic datasets for training and evaluation, which involves artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Finally, the paper demonstrates the generalization ability of the proposed method using real-world images and Google Earth, which involves graphics (GR) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
