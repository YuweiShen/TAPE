The algorithm proposed in the paper involves using diversification, a technique for making all coefficients of the unknown polynomial distinguishable, which is a concept related to data structures (cs.DS) and scientific computing (cs.SC). Finally, the paper also discusses the implementation and experimental results of the algorithm, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
