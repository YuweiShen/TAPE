Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves preprocessing and output-sensitive parameters, which are common topics in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The use of logarithmic time and space complexities suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The problem of computing weak visibility polygons can also be related to cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
