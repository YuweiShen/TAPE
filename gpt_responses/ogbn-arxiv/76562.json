It may also belong to Information Retrieval (cs.IR) because the approach involves collecting messages from different documents and using them to determine the summary content. Machine Learning (cs.LG) is another likely sub-category because the approach involves instantiating cross-document relations. Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) is also a possibility because the approach involves summarization, which is a task often associated with AI. Finally, Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) is a possible sub-category because the approach involves analyzing multiple sources of information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
