Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves the use of neural networks, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of machine learning algorithms for classification puts it under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves the use of Building Information Model (BIM) software, which falls under cs.AR (Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality). Finally, the paper deals with the construction industry, which could fall under cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
