The use of weakly supervised learning and texture features also suggests a focus on CV. The paper also discusses the use of transfer learning, which is a common topic in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). The release of feature datasets further supports the focus on ML. The use of multiple centers and scanners suggests a focus on medical imaging (MS) and multimedia (MM). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.MS, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
