This makes it likely that the paper could be classified under computational geometry. \n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the complexity of decoding algorithms for linear codes, which is a topic that falls under the scope of computational complexity. \n5. cs.SD (Sound) - This is a less likely category, but the paper mentions the use of differentials, which is a concept that is used in sound processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
