The most relevant sub-category is likely cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as the paper discusses a specific algorithm for game-solving. The paper also mentions game theory (cs.GT) and machine learning (cs.LG) as related fields. Additionally, the algorithm involves pruning actions, which is a technique commonly used in data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the convergence of the algorithm, which is a topic that falls under control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
