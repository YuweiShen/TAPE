This involves analyzing video data to extract information about heart rate variability (HRV) and pulse peaks. Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) due to the use of deep networks. The paper also discusses potential medical applications, suggesting human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and neuroscience (cs.NE) as additional possible categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
