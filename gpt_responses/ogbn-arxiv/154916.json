These are all problems related to computational geometry, which suggests that cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The algorithms proposed in the paper also involve space-efficient data structures and algorithms, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also mentions the use of O(sqrt(n)) extra space, which suggests that it could be related to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The paper also involves the use of graphs and paths, which could fall under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.GR (Graph Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
