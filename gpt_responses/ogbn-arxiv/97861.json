The use of partial Fourier matrices and $\\ell_1$ minimization is common in compressed sensing, which also suggests cs.NA (numerical analysis) as a possible sub-category. The paper also uses tools from decoupling, which is a technique in mathematics and computer science used in various fields such as probability theory, harmonic analysis, and computational geometry. This suggests cs.MM (mathematical methods) and cs.CG (computational geometry) as possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
