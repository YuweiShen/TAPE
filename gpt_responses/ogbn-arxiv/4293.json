It also discusses techniques for efficient mapping of the calculations to many-node parallel systems. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the computational challenges posed by the growing sizes of genomic datasets and the quadratic, cubic or higher scaling characteristics of the relevant algorithms. It proposes a solution for performing vector similarity metrics calculations that can handle these challenges. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper mentions Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Phenome Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), which involve large datasets and require efficient algorithms for data processing and analysis. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of genomic data for determining genetic causes of observed individual traits, which is a problem that can be addressed using machine learning techniques. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): Although not explicitly mentioned in the paper, the use of GPUs and Intel Xeon Phi processors for parallel computing is a common technique in the field of neural and evolutionary computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
