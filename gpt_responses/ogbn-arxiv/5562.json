The paper also mentions the use of optimization techniques (cs.NA) and machine learning (cs.LG) for sparse signal reconstruction. Additionally, the paper discusses the reconstruction of signals in the discrete Fourier domain (DFT), which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
