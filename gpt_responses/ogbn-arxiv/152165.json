The paper also mentions the use of universal linear decoders for compound channels, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). The iterative decoder proposed in the paper involves optimization and iterative algorithms, which are part of the field of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the experimental work involves performance evaluation and comparison with previous state-of-the-art decoders, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
