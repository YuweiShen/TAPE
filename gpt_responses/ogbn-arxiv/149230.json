The paper also discusses polynomial time complexity, which is a topic studied in theoretical computer science (cs.TH) and specifically in the subfield of computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of proof nets and paths in the proof nets suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of programming languages (cs.PL) and the subfield of graph theory and algorithms (cs.DS, cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
