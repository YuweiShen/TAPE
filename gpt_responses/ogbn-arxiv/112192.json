This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the programming languages (cs.PL) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves computations of convex hulls, which suggests that it may also belong to the computational geometry (cs.CG) sub-category. The use of linear constraint solving machinery suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
