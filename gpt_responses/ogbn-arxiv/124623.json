This is a core topic in programming languages research.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper focuses on information flow security and presents a formal noninterference guarantee. This is a core topic in cryptography and security research.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a new approach to enforcing information flow policies that reduces the policy burden on programmers. This is a core topic in software engineering research.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper presents a formal encoding of information flow security in terms of decidable refinement types. This is a core topic in logic in computer science research.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents a program repair algorithm that localizes unsafe accesses to sensitive data and replaces them with provably secure alternatives. This is a core topic in systems and control research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
