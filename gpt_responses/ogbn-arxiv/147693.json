Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also introduces a new supervision method based on optimal transport, which can be understood as a Wasserstein gradient flow. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, since the proposed approach is applied to image captioning, the paper may also be relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
