The use of geometric stopping time and the development of upper and lower bounds simultaneously suggest that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of probability matching algorithm and the analysis of the optimal adversary suggest that the paper may also belong to the Game Theory (cs.GT) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the general framework for designing the optimal algorithm and adversary for an arbitrary number of experts suggests that the paper may also belong to the Data Structures (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
