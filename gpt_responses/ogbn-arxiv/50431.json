The paper focuses on the optimization of the harvested power for an RMA scenario, which involves reliable symbol detection and prediction. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the study of communication systems and their information processing capabilities. Other likely sub-categories include cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.PE (Performance)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
