This involves channel estimation, quantization, and detection, which are all topics related to information theory (cs.IT). The use of massive MIMO also involves network infrastructure (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also proposes a novel channel estimator and approximation method, which falls under the category of mathematical methods in computer science (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the robustness of the system against power imbalances, which is related to communication networks (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
