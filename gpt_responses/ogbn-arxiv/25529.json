The use of Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) for selecting diverse neurons is a technique that is commonly used in machine learning and falls under the category of probabilistic models. The paper also discusses the use of this technique for network compression, which is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The focus on regularization and auto-tuning of network architecture suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the sub-fields of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper's compatibility with other procedures for reducing memory footprints suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
