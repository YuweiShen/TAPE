Hence, the most likely sub-category is cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) as CNNs are widely used in computer vision applications. The paper also discusses energy efficiency, which suggests a possible fit for cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The use of systolic arrays and dataflow optimization may also suggest a fit for cs.SY (Systems and Control), and the ASIC design flow may suggest a fit for cs.ET (Emerging Technologies)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
