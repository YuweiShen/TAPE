The proposed LV-Net is based on the shape of network architecture and consists of two key modules. The first module extracts complementary information hierarchically using a two-stream pyramid structure, which is beneficial to perceiving the diverse scales and local details of salient objects. The second module gradually integrates encoder detail features with decoder semantic features through nested connections, which aims at suppressing the cluttered backgrounds and highlighting the salient objects. This paper involves computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), and information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
