The proposed methodology involves setting latent values in Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The paper also mentions using an heuristic to estimate gesture complexity, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the task of recognizing human gestures is often associated with human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
