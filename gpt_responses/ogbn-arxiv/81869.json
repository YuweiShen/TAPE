Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a simpler approach using pre-trained CNNs and attention mechanisms, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of temporal softmax pooling suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) category. Additionally, the paper deals with human emotions, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
