This involves natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques, which are typically covered in the cs.CL and cs.CV sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions training baseline systems and evaluating their performance using both qualitative and quantitative metrics, which suggests the involvement of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, covered in the cs.AI and cs.LG sub-categories.
