The paper also incorporates machine learning and neural network uncertainty, which suggests it could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper's feature selection strategy involves Bayesian neural networks, which could place it in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper's use of the KITTI odometry dataset suggests it could also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
