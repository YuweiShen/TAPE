The paper proposes two novel trackers that use deep reinforcement learning and an expert demonstrator to improve tracking performance. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also mentions the use of reinforcement learning, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with tracking in videos, which could fall under cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
