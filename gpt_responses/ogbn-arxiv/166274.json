The paper also involves a systematic exploration of the perturbation space, which could be related to programming languages (cs.PL). The use of perfect oracles to determine the correctness of the output could be related to cryptography and security (cs.CR). The study of software stability could also be related to control systems (cs.SY) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
