This topic is closely related to multimedia analysis and computer vision (cs.MM, cs.CV), as well as information retrieval (cs.IR) and computer security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper proposes a two-tiered approach to searching for related images, which involves filtering a large pool of objects, a task that is often tackled using data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
