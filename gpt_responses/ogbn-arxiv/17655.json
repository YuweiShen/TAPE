The use of soft decision forward error correction (SD-FEC) and bit interleaving suggests a focus on error correction and coding theory (cs.DS). The study of prediction accuracy for post-FEC bit error rate may also involve networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
