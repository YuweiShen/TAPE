The use of pilot-aided channel estimates and beamforming techniques suggests a focus on networking and communications (cs.NI), while the consideration of transmitter/receiver dynamic-range limitations and the derivation of upper and lower bounds on achievable rates suggests a systems and control perspective (cs.SY). The use of MIMO technology and the study of the behavior of the sum-rate as a function of various parameters suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and computer networks (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
