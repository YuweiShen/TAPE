The proposed method involves using an adversarial network to generate examples with occlusions and deformations, which is a technique commonly used in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of data-driven strategies and the long-tail distribution of occlusions and deformations, which are topics related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The joint learning of the original detector and adversary also involves optimization and training of neural networks, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper presents experimental results and comparisons with other object detection pipelines, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
