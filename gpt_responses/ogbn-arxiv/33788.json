This involves optimization of gradients subject to integrability, parallel integration of optimized gradients, and a parallel Gauss-Seidel solver for the diffusion step. These techniques are relevant to computer graphics (cs.CG) and geometric modeling (cs.GR), as well as numerical analysis (cs.NA) and computational geometry (cs.CG). Additionally, the paper mentions using the approach for image processing (cs.CV), which is another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
