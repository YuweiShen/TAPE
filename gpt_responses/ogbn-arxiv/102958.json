This falls under the broad category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with the challenge of detecting concurrent faults, which requires a system-level approach and falls under the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY). The use of sensory data and signal processing techniques also suggests the category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). Finally, the experimental validation of the proposed method on diverse fault conditions such as unbalance and misalignment suggests the category of Software Engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
