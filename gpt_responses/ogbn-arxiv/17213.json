The paper also discusses the use of optical sensors for joint-angle estimation, which is a topic related to computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed controller takes into account the physical and sensing limitations of the vehicle, which is a topic related to control systems (cs.SY). The paper also uses model predictive control, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
