Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of stereo cameras and LiDAR as adaptive plug-in sensors to refine the 3D box localization performance. The paper also mentions the use of instance vector representation to model the local geometry of observed elements, which is a common technique used in computer vision. The other likely sub-categories are robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) as the paper discusses the use of multiple sensors and proposes a framework for multi-sensor refinement. The paper may also belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category as it uses technical language and terminology commonly used in computer vision and machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
