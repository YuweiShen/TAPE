The codes are subcodes of extended BCH codes, which are commonly used in error-correcting codes (cs.CC). The proposed decoding algorithm involves directed search in a code tree, which is a common technique in search algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of estimates of channel error probabilities, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
