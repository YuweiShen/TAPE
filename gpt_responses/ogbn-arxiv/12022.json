The paper also discusses the cycle structure of the set of sequences produced by a specific LFSR, which is related to combinatorics (cs.DM). The paper proposes an efficient algorithm to find all conjugate pairs between any two cycles, which involves numerical analysis (cs.NA) and graph theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
