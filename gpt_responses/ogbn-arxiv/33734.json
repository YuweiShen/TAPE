This involves the use of dynamic multi-armed bandits, which is a simplified view of Markov decision processes. This work is closely related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, specifically in the areas of optimization and decision making. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper involves the use of heuristics and optimization techniques, which are related to the sub-categories cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
