Additionally, the paper proposes a deep-network-based hashing method, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of multi-index hashing (MIH) also suggests that the paper may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on several benchmark datasets, indicating that it may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
