The use of rigid graphs to define the inter-agent distance conditions suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of robotics (cs.RO). The paper proposes a class of graphs and control laws for which all stable equilibria are target configurations, which involves mathematical analysis and optimization (cs.MA). The problem of designing control laws whose stable equilibria are all target configurations is a challenging problem in the field of dynamical systems (cs.DS). Finally, the use of decentralized control laws suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
