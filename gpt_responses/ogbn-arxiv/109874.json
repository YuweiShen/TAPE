The use of contextual blocks is a novel approach to providing contextual information to the classifier, which is a machine learning technique, making it likely to also fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The application of this technique is for autonomous navigation systems, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the computational efficiency of the proposed methodology, which could be relevant to the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with road detection, which could also fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR) as it is relevant to the security of autonomous vehicles."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
