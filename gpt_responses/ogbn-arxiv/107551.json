The proposed solution involves developing metrics to measure the fairness of users, the reliability of ratings, and the goodness of products. These metrics are formulated using a mutually recursive definition and incorporate behavioral properties of users and products. The paper also presents an iterative algorithm, FairJudge, to predict the values of these metrics. Given the focus on social media and e-commerce, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves algorithmic and computational aspects, which suggest the sub-categories cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
