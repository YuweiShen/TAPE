The paper specifically focuses on randomized smoothing, which is a technique used to improve the statistical robustness of neural networks. Given this focus, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper deals with security and adversarial attacks, it could also be categorized under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
