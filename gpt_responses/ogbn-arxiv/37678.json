This involves mapping user-annotated tags to locations' taste keywords and predicting the contextual relevance of locations. The paper also investigates different approaches to address the data sparsity problem and incorporates new information from the mapping into a POI recommendation approach using learning to rank techniques. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is Information Retrieval (cs.IR) as the paper deals with personalized recommendation and ranking of POIs. Other likely sub-categories include Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Software Engineering (cs.SD), Computation and Language (cs.CL), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) as the paper involves contextual appropriateness, data sparsity, and probabilistic modeling."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
