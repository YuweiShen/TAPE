The iterative nature of the proposed framework also involves recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and stacked neural networks, which are commonly used in deep learning (cs.DL). The paper also discusses the use of global and local thresholding, which is a common technique in image processing (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves the use of public benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
