The paper proposes a method for learning to master multiple sequential-decision tasks at once, which falls under the category of multi-task learning. The paper also uses the Atari game environment and the DeepMind Lab environment, which are commonly used in the field of reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
