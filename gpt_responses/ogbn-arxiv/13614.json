The study of graph homomorphisms is also closely related to computational complexity (cs.CC) and graph theory (cs.GT). The paper also involves the study of structural properties of graphs, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the use of modular arithmetic, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
