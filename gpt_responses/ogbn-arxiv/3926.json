It also discusses the performance of fixed-rate Slepian-Wolf codes, which is related to channel coding (cs.CC). The paper presents bounds on the reliability function, which involves probability theory and statistics (cs.SI). The use of variable-rate codes also has implications for data storage and compression, which are topics in data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
