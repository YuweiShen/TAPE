The paper discusses the use of multiple learners to improve robustness against such attacks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves image processing (cs.CV) and optimization (cs.DS), which are relevant to the problem at hand."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
