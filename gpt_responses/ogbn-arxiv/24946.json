The algorithms presented in the paper involve data structures (cs.DS) and combinatorics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the partial drawing extension problem and the simultaneous drawing problem, which are related to graph theory (cs.GT) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
