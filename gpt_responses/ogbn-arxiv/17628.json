It also involves the use of algebraic structures such as rings and polynomials, which falls under information theory (cs.IT) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The study of Boolean functions and their approximations is closely related to data structures (cs.DS) and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
