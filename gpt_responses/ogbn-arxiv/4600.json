This problem is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), control systems (cs.SY), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper proposes a novel approach to self-calibration that uses information theoretic metrics to select the most informative parts of a dataset for calibration purposes. This approach is applicable to a wide range of applications and can be used in resource-constrained systems such as mobile phones. Therefore, it is likely that this paper could be classified under any of the above-mentioned sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
