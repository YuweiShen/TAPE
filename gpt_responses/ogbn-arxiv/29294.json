The paper also discusses the use of algorithms to reduce the search complexity of the random vector quantization (RVQ) codebook, which falls under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the paper includes examples of the performance of the proposed method, which could be considered as a machine learning (cs.MM) or learning (cs.LG) problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
