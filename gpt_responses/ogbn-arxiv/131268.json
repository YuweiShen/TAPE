The paper also uses a formal theory of teaching and experiments to analyze the effectiveness of IDS in teaching phonetic categories, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and statistical learning (cs.SD). Additionally, the paper discusses potential pitfalls for experimentalists exploring the role of IDS in language learning, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.SI) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
