The use of convex optimization and sparsity regularization also suggests a potential fit for machine learning (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the computational efficiency aspect of the proposed algorithm may also relate to the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
