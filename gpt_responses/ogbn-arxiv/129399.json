The paper also describes the creation of agents capable of playing these games, which is a key aspect of AI research. \n\n2. cs.GT (Game Theory): The Digital Ludeme Project aims to reconstruct and analyze over 1000 traditional strategy games using modern techniques. Game theory is a natural fit for analyzing and understanding the strategies and outcomes of these games. \n\n3. cs.LG (Learning): The paper discusses the creation of agents capable of playing a wide range of games, which involves learning and adapting to new game environments. \n\n4. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper describes the Ludii game description language, which is used to design and modify games in the Ludii system. This is a programming language specifically designed for game development. \n\n5. cs.SD (Software Development): The paper discusses the advantages of the Ludii system over prior general game software, which is a topic relevant to software development."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
