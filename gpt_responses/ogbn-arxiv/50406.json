This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) categories. The paper also deals with object detection methods applied in the underwater domain, which falls under the robotics (cs.ROB) category. The paper also presents a novel framework for adapting a ROI-based 6D object pose estimation method to work on full fisheye images, which falls under the computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CVPR) category. Finally, the paper contributes a fisheye image dataset, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
