This involves using learnable node embeddings and attention coefficients that depend on Euclidean distance. The resulting GCNs, called permutohedral-GCNs, achieve state-of-the-art performance on several node classification benchmarks. Given the focus on machine learning and neural networks, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). However, the use of attention mechanisms and embeddings suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of Gaussian filtering techniques and the focus on scalability and efficiency suggest that the paper may also be relevant to neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
