This involves joint object detection, curb detection, and safe drivable area detection. Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV) followed by robotics (cs.RO) as the paper deals with autonomous driving. Machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) are also likely categories as the paper discusses the use of neural networks for object detection and scene understanding. Finally, computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) is a possible category as the paper discusses the potential for decreased costs in using camera-based systems for driver assistance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
