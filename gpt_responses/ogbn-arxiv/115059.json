It may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category as text detection is a common task in information retrieval. Additionally, it may belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category as text detection is a fundamental task in natural language processing. The paper also introduces a new loss function, which may make it relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the evaluation of the approach on benchmarks may make it relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
