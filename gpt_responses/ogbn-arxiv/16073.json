It also involves network infrastructure (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY) as it considers the deployment of small cells and the power control policies for both small and macrocell base stations. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of partial differential equations to derive the power control policy, which falls under the category of mathematical modeling (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
