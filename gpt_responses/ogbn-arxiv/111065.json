The paper also discusses the concept of local testing, which is a topic in theoretical computer science and falls under the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) and computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper uses algebraic techniques to study the codes, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
