The paper also discusses the Varshamov\u2013Tenengol\u2019ts\u2013Constantin\u2013Rao codes, which are a class of error-correcting codes (cs.CR). The methods used in the paper involve generalized code concatenation, which is a technique commonly used in coding theory and can be classified under data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the superiority of the constructed codes compared to existing codes, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI) and network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
