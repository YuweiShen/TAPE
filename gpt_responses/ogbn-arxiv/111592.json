Additionally, the paper discusses the use of these networks in autonomous underwater vehicles, which falls under the category of cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also proposes new modules for the neural networks, which could potentially fall under the categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning).
