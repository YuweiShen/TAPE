The main focus is on the joint learning of feature extraction, affinity estimation, and multi-dimensional assignment for robust MOT. Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves a target management scheme and single object tracking, which are related to robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
