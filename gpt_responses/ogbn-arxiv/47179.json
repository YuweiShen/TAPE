The proposed framework includes a region feature alignment module and a region of interest (RoI) jittering training strategy, which are both related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper provides dense, high-quality, and modality-independent color-thermal annotation pairs, which can be useful for multimodal (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
