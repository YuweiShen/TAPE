It is also likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as multi-task learning is a popular area of research in machine learning. Additionally, the paper proposes a new sharing unit, which could fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of neural networks also suggests that it could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on recognition tasks could also place it in the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category, as natural language processing tasks often involve recognition and classification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
