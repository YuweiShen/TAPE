This involves the use of message-passing algorithms and linear programming techniques. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), which deal with optimization problems and probabilistic graphical models. The paper also involves the use of algorithms and data structures, which are covered by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms).
