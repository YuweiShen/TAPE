The paper provides a necessary and sufficient criterion for the variable version of the LLL, and obtains boundaries for two families of event-variable graphs. This suggests that the paper is likely to be classified under cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.GT (Graph Theory), or cs.PR (Probability)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
