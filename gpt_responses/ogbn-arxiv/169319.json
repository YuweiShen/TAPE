This involves the use of Radio Frequency (RF) chains, signal routing, and channel models, which are all related to Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), and Systems and Control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of millimeter wave channel models, which falls under Multimedia (cs.MM) and Architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
