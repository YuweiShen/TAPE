Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the use of edge computing and AI, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), or cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper discusses the use of onboard processing and Cloud computing, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
