The identification of formula blocks/cells and data blocks/cells referenced by those formulas suggests the use of programming languages (cs.PL) and databases (cs.DB). The mention of managing and protecting workbooks suggests the application of computer engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the use of the software for initial watching and subsequent management suggests a potential application in human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
