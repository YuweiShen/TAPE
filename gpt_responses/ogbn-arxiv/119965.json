The paper also addresses malicious failures, which fall under the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of State Machine Replication and benchmarks suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. The hybrid cloud environment discussed in the paper involves communication between private and public clouds, which could be relevant to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a dynamic mode switching technique, which could be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
