The use of metric spaces and preference rankings suggests a connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves analyzing and comparing different voting rules, which is a common theme in algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The use of metrics and optimization techniques may also suggest a connection to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG).
