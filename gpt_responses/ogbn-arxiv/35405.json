Therefore, cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves large-scale data collection and deep learning, which are common in computer vision (cs.CV), information retrieval (cs.IR), and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper uses a neural network to predict tappability, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
