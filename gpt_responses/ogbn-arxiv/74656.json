The use of $\\ell_p$ distance and juntas suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the specific properties of valuation functions that are tested (submodularity, XOS, OXS, unit demand, coverage, and self-bounding) are commonly studied in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
