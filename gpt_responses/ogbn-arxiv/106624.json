The achievable rate region is obtained, which enlarges the capacity region of the vector broadcast channel with vector channel magnitude feedback by means of superposition coding. This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a broadcast setting with two antennas at the transmit side and two single-antenna receiving terminals. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not deal with social networks, but it does deal with information networks, which is a subcategory of cs.SI.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a broadcast setting with two antennas at the transmit side and two single-antenna receiving terminals. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper does not deal with multimedia, but it does deal with communication systems, which is a subcategory of cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
