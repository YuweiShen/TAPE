It discusses the design challenges of providing efficient incremental support for a broad range of programs and argues that first-class names are a critical linguistic feature for efficient incremental computation. This suggests that the paper is likely to be classified under cs.PL.\n\n2. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the benefits of using names for efficient incremental computation and presents Nominal Adapton, a language for incremental computation with names. It also demonstrates how to use Nominal Adapton to efficiently incrementalize several standard programming patterns. This suggests that the paper may also be classified under cs.SE.\n\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents efficient, incremental probabilistic trees and tries built using Nominal Adapton. This suggests that the paper may also be classified under cs.DS.\n\n4. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper formalizes Nominal Adapton as a core calculus and proves it is from-scratch consistent, meaning it always produces the same answer as simply re-running the computation. This suggests that the paper may also be classified under cs.LO.\n\n5. cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): While the paper does not explicitly discuss formal languages and automata theory, the formalization of Nom"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
