The paper also proposes a semi-supervised learning approach, which involves training a model with both labeled and unlabeled data, and this is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of generalization to new and unseen data, which is a topic related to robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
