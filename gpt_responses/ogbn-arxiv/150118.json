The authors also mention the potential applications of self-orthogonal rank metric codes in network coding and distributed storage, which are areas of computer science that fall under cs.CC and cs.DS respectively. The paper involves probabilistic analysis and uses tools from coding theory, which are also relevant to sub-categories such as cs.SI and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
