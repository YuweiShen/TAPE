The paper also proposes a novel framework for building a single stage face detector, which involves training a convolutional neural network, making it likely to also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed detector on several public face detection benchmarks, which could also place it under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new loss function to train the model, which could also place it under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
