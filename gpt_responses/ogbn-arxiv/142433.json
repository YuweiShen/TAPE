It also involves the use of Wyner-Ziv coding, which is a type of distributed source coding commonly used in multimedia applications (cs.MM). The concept of scalability is also a key aspect of the paper, which is relevant to scalable video coding and other related fields (cs.SI). The paper provides inner and outer bounds for general discrete memoryless sources, which is a topic in data compression and coding theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of quadratic Gaussian sources, which is a topic in information theory and signal processing (cs.ITP)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
