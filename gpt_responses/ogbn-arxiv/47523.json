The use of abstract tools and the investigation of normalizing strategies suggest a focus on logic and computation (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL). The study of uniqueness of the result and comparison of different rewrite sequences suggest a connection to theoretical computer science (cs.TCS) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the mention of probabilistic lambda-calculi and non-deterministic evaluation suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
