The paper proposes a new framework that exploits retrieval results to improve the diversity and informativeness of generated responses. This involves using a skeleton-then-response paradigm, which combines information retrieval techniques with a generative model. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related areas. The paper also involves information retrieval techniques, which suggests that it could belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Additionally, the use of a generative model involves machine learning, which could place it in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves experimentation and evaluation, which could suggest it belongs to cs.LG (Learning) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
