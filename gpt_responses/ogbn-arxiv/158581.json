Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely category. The paper also presents a dynamic programming algorithm, which is a common technique in algorithms and data structures, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) another likely category. The problem involves discrete distances between points, which suggests cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) as another possible category. The paper also mentions that there is no subquadratic algorithm known for this problem, which implies that the paper may be of interest to researchers in cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Finally, the paper uses finite automata to encode legal positions of the frogs, which suggests that it may also be relevant to researchers in cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
