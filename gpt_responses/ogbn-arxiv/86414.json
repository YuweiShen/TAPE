The use of synthetic data for training the networks suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) component. Additionally, the development of a new transformation engine using only point locations could be of interest to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) community. Finally, the paper's focus on geometric stability and well-distributed points could be relevant to computer graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
