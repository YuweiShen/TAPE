The consideration of adversarial corruptions at the physical layer of communication suggests a possible connection to cyber-physical systems (cs.CY). The formalization of security and reliability of key agreement protocols may involve system theory (cs.SY). Finally, the use of constructions to achieve the bound on the rate of key agreement may involve multimedia (cs.MM) if the protocols involve audio or video communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
