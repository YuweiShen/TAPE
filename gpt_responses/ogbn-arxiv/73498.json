The paper also mentions optimization-guided trial-and-error, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve large-scale machine learning, which is often associated with distributed computing (cs.DC). The experiments also involve image and video classification, which are common topics in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper mentions re-tuning settings during execution, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
