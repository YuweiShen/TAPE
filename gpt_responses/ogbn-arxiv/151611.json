Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the computation complexity advantage of ResNet, which could also place it in the sub-categories of neural networks (cs.NE) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
