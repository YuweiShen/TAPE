The use of Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA) techniques suggests that the paper is likely to be related to numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the properties of the minimum norm linear estimator, which is a classical model in statistics and machine learning, suggesting that the paper could be related to data science (cs.DS). The paper's focus on the implicit regularization of over-parameterized training samples and the use of ridge-regularized least squares suggests that the paper could be related to information theory (cs.IT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper's use of deep neural networks and its discussion of the double descent phenomenon suggests that the paper is most likely to be classified under the machine learning category (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
