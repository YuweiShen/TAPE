It introduces a new method called residual component analysis (RCA) that decomposes the residual variance into its components through a generalized eigenvalue problem. The paper applies the method to various datasets, including protein-signaling networks, gene expression time-series data, and motion capture 3-D cloud data. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
