Therefore, the most likely category is cs.SE (Software Engineering). The paper also mentions object-oriented programming, which suggests that it could belong to cs.PL (Programming Languages) or cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The use of program proving tools indicates that it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
