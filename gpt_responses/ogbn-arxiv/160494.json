This topic is closely related to several sub-fields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), systems and control (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and computer engineering (cs.CE). Given the focus on wireless communication and signal processing, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely sub-categories. The use of noncoherent modulation and moments-based approach suggests a strong emphasis on mathematical analysis and optimization, which further supports the choice of cs.IT and cs.NI. However, the paper also considers practical issues such as energy conversion efficiency and relay location, which may be relevant to cs.SY and cs.CE. Finally, the Monte Carlo simulation study involves the generation and analysis of large datasets, which is a common theme in cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
