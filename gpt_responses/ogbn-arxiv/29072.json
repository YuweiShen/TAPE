The paper also explores the factors that contribute to the variance in performance, including weight initialization and training data order, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of early stopping to prevent overfitting, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
