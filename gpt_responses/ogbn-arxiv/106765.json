The algorithms presented in the paper use retroactive data structures, which are a type of dynamic data structures that allow for efficient modifications of past operations, and hence, the paper also falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the limits of nearest-neighbor database security, which is related to database systems (cs.DB). The paper presents algorithms for constructing an $\\epsilon$-approximate cloning of $V(S)$, which involves approximation algorithms (cs.DM). Finally, the paper's use of proximity queries and retroactive data structures for constructing Voronoi diagrams has potential applications in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
