This is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research, and the proposed method involves introducing new operators to the CNN architecture, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the proposed method, which is relevant to the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and presents experimental results on several datasets, which is relevant to the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
