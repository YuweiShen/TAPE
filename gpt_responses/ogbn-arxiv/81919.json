The paper also proposes a novel method for achieving this goal, which involves designing generative networks with a common Progressive Rendering Architecture (PRA), which could fall under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or graphics (cs.GR). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of an auxiliary domain to aid in learning disentangled representations, which could also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
