The paper focuses on the use of latent variables to capture hidden parameters that vary across tasks, facilitating transfer across tasks. This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV). Given the focus on RL and transfer learning, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.RO and cs.SY due to the application to robotics, and cs.CV due to the use of MuJoCo tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
