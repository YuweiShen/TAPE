Additionally, the focus on neural pathways and the use of high-resolution imaging data suggests that the paper may also fall under the neural networks (cs.NE) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of deep learning for automation also suggests that the paper may fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.
