The paper proposes an algorithm to find approximate rankings using a limited number of comparisons. This problem is closely related to topics in machine learning such as supervised learning, active learning, and ranking algorithms. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of confidence intervals and statistical analysis, which suggests that it could also be relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
