The use of a specific ring and the discussion of hulls and generators of codes suggest that the paper may also fall under the categories of cryptography (cs.CR) and discrete structures (cs.DS). Additionally, the mention of average dimension and parameters of codes suggests that the paper may also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
