The problem of finding optimal sink locations for flow evacuation can also be seen as a network optimization problem (cs.NE). The use of regret optimization is a common technique in game theory and decision making (cs.GT), and the paper also involves the development of algorithms (cs.DM) and the analysis of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
