Given that the paper focuses on image classification and proposes a method for object localisation, it is most likely to be categorised under cs.CV. However, since the paper also discusses the theoretical implications of using mutual information in classification neural networks, it could also be categorised under cs.LG, cs.IT, cs.AI, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
