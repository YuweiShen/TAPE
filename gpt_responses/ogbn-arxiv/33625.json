The paper also involves simulations with 3GPP-specified radio channel models, which falls under the domain of cs.IT (Information Theory). The use of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for tracking the train position falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). The pursuit of high-accuracy and high-availability positioning technology is also relevant to the sub-categories of cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
