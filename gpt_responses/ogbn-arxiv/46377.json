The focus on CNNs suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as another likely sub-category. The use of dynamic selection and appending of instances to a training dataset suggests a focus on optimization and sampling techniques, which could fall under neural networks (cs.NE) or control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
