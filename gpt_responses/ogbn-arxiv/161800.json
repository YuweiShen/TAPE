The method involves pruning connections in the network, which is a form of network optimization and can also be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of splicing to avoid incorrect pruning, which is a form of network architecture design and can be categorized under neural engineering (cs.NE) or distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
