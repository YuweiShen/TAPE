The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fully connected linear multi-layer networks suggests that the paper may also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of rectified linear units (ReLU) and L1 regularization, which are common techniques in neural network optimization and may indicate that the paper belongs to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. The use of semi-infinite duality and minimum norm regularization suggests that the paper may also belong to the dynamical systems (cs.DS) or systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
