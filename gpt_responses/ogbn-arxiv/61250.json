The proposed solution involves encoding the signal using a random matrix, which is a technique commonly used in compressed sensing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.MM) for signal recovery. The paper also discusses exploiting the sparsity of the channel impulse response, which is a topic in both machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SP)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
