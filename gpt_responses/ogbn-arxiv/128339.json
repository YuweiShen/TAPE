The paper also discusses convergence and stability problems within the framework of integral equation theory, which are typical topics in numerical analysis. \n\n2. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The BKM proposed in the paper is applicable to a wide range of problems in computational engineering and science, such as fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetics. The paper also discusses the formulation of linear modeling equations for nonlinear PDEs with linear boundary conditions, which is relevant to many engineering and scientific applications. \n\n3. cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper proposes a new methodology for constructing efficient radial basis functions (RBFs) in the dual reciprocity and domain-type RBF collocation methods. The paper also discusses the convergence and stability of RBFs within the framework of integral equation theory, which are important topics in mathematical software development. \n\n4. cs.EM (Electromagnetics): The BKM proposed in the paper is particularly suitable for solving electromagnetic problems, as it avoids the artificial boundary in the method of fundamental solution. The paper also discusses the convergence and stability of RBFs in the context"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
