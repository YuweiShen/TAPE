The models are trained using machine learning techniques such as neural networks, which fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The knowledge bases themselves are typically stored in databases (cs.DB), and the task of link prediction can also be seen as a form of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
