The paper also proposes novel stacked hierarchical networks and an end-to-end training strategy, which are techniques commonly used in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the use of 3D models and shapes, which falls under the category of computer graphics (cs.GR). Additionally, the paper involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques such as deep neural networks, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves the use of robotics applications such as 3D reconstruction, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
