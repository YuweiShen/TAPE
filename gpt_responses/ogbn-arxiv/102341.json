This involves optimization of the frequency division multiplexed preambles to minimize the mean square error of channel estimation subject to energy constraints. This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT), communication systems (cs.COMM), signal processing (cs.SI), networked systems (cs.NI), and machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves optimization and performance evaluation of a communication system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
