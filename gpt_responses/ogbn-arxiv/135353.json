Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also uses a neural encoder-decoder model, which falls under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper introduces a new dataset and evaluates its approach against classical mathematical OCR systems, which could fall under the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
