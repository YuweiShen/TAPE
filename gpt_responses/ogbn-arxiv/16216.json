Information theory is closely related to signal processing and the optimization problems presented in the paper involve minimizing information-theoretic quantities such as mutual information. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper presents a new graph-based low-rank decomposition and a general class of convex optimization problems for solving low-rank tensor inverse problems. These techniques are commonly used in machine learning for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper demonstrates applications for a wide variety of real tensor datasets, including surveillance videos and hyperspectral images, which are commonly used in computer vision. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper uses spectral graph theory to analyze multi-dimensional signals on graphs, which is a common technique in social and information networks research. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes a new framework for low-rank tensor analysis that involves solving convex optimization problems. Numerical analysis is closely related to optimization and the techniques presented in the paper involve solving large-scale numerical problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
