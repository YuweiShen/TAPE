The paper also introduces a new architecture that improves the performance of existing models, which is a topic that falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of LSTM units, which are commonly used in robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM) applications.
