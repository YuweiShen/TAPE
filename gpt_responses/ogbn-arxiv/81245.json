This involves optimizing the critical component of the framework, namely global aggregation or allreduce using a novel concept of tensor collectives. The paper also provides empirical evidence using large scale ImageNet 1K data. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
