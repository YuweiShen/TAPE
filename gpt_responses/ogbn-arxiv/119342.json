This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of feedback to adapt the sequence of problems to the instance presented, which is a common technique in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also uses datasets that involve image processing (cs.CV) and information theory (cs.IT), which further support the possibility of these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
