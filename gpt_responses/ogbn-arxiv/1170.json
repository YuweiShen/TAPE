Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. Additionally, the paper involves multi-task learning, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. The system also deals with tracking objects in real-time, which could be related to robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
