GEP is a machine learning technique, which falls under the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of multi-objective optimization algorithms like NSGA II and SPEA 2, which are commonly used in the field of Evolutionary Computation (cs.NE) and Control Engineering (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper involves the use of mathematical equations and modelling techniques, which are relevant to Computational Engineering (cs.CE). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE, cs.SY, and cs.CE, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
