Information theory deals with the fundamental limits of communication systems, and this paper presents a new strategy to achieve higher rates in multirelay networks, which falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with multiple-relay networks and proposes a new relaying strategy. Networking and Internet Architecture is a broad category that covers various aspects of network design, protocols, and architectures, and this paper falls under this category as it proposes a new strategy for relaying in networks.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with relaying in networks, which is a fundamental aspect of social and information networks. The paper proposes a new strategy for relaying in multirelay networks, which can be applied to social and information networks as well.\n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper proposes a new strategy for relaying in multirelay networks, which involves decoding and forwarding of messages. Computational complexity deals with the study of algorithms and their efficiency, and this paper proposes a new algorithm for relaying in networks, which falls under the scope of computational complexity.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
