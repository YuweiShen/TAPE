The proposed method is demonstrated on logistic regression for face image and brain image classification, indicating that it is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
