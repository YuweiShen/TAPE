The introduction of a watchtower committee and the design of incentives for honest behavior also involve game theory and mechanism design, which are relevant to the fields of machine learning (cs.LG) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper's focus on scalability and network congestion may also make it relevant to the field of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
