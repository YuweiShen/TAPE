This falls under the scope of database management, making cs.DB the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The study also focuses on analyzing big data, which involves extracting useful information from it. This falls under the scope of information retrieval, making cs.IR a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.CY (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions security challenges that limit the use of big data, which falls under the scope of cryptography and security, making cs.CY a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper also mentions cost challenges that limit the use of big data, which falls under the scope of cryptography and security, making cs.CR a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the management procedures required to achieve efficient use of big data, which falls under the scope of software engineering, making cs.SE a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
