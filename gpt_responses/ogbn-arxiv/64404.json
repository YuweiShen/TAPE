This involves audiovisual feature-embedding and prediction modules, which are typical of multimedia (cs.MM) and computer vision (cs.CV) research. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel dataset of 360\u00b0 audio-visual videos, which falls under the sub-category of multimedia. The problem of estimating 3D sound-source locations also involves signal processing (cs.SI) and data analysis (cs.SDQ). Finally, the paper proposes evaluation criteria to investigate the performance of the pipeline, which is a common practice in the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
