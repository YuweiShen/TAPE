The use of Shannon entropy suggests that information theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant. The mention of extra space and bounded norm suggests that data structures (cs.DS) may be relevant. The use of condition numbers suggests that numerical analysis (cs.NA) may also be relevant. Finally, the mention of potential functions suggests that control systems (cs.SY) may be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
