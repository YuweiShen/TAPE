The use of Gaussian Process (GP) models for mapping and planning tasks is a common technique in machine learning (cs.AI) and statistical learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions simulations, which suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
