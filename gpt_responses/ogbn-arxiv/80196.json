The use of a novel CNN-based architecture and the focus on end-to-end training suggest that the paper may also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The proposed architecture involves the integration of contextual information, which could be related to natural language processing (cs.CL) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the datasets used in the experiments are related to multimedia (cs.MM), as they involve street-level images and videos."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
