This falls under the purview of information theory. \n2. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper presents a novel low-power VLSI design for the complex K-best decoder, which is a hardware architecture problem. \n3. cs.ET (Embedded Systems): The proposed VLSI architecture is designed for low-power consumption, which is a key requirement for embedded systems. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper uses the Schnorr-Euchner (SE) enumeration algorithm and a new parameter, Rlimit, to reduce the complexity of calculating K-best nodes. This involves the use of data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a hardware architecture for a MIMO decoder, which is a key component in wireless communication systems.
