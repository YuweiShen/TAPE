This problem is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), as it requires the development of novel algorithms and models to address the challenges of recognizing and localizing unseen objects. The paper also proposes a new loss function that utilizes semantic information, which is a common theme in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the experiments involve the use of deep neural networks, which is a common tool in multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
