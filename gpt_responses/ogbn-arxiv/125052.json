The paper also discusses the computational complexity of finding socially optimal matchings, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper proposes quantitative solution concepts for stability, which can be seen as a form of optimization and decision-making (cs.SI). Finally, the paper explores trade-offs between stability and other criteria of societal optimality, which is a topic in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
