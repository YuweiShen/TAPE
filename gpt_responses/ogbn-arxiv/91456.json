This optimization problem can be viewed as an information-theoretic problem, making cs.IT a likely category. \n2. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper deals with direction of arrival estimation, which is a signal processing problem. The proposed algorithms are subspace-based, which is a common approach in signal processing. Hence, cs.SI is a likely category. \n3. cs.SP (Speech Processing): Although the paper does not explicitly mention speech processing, direction of arrival estimation is a common problem in speech processing applications such as speaker localization and speech enhancement. Hence, cs.SP is a possible category. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed algorithms involve iterative optimization and subspace estimation, which are common techniques in machine learning. Hence, cs.LG is a possible category. \n5. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The proposed algorithms involve numerical optimization and subspace estimation, which are numerical analysis techniques. Hence, cs.NA is a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
