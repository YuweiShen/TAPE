The paper proposes a heuristic algorithm to solve the problem, which is a common approach in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-categories. The algorithm is based on a Tabu Search method, which is a popular optimization technique in the Data Structures (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the algorithm on large-sized instances, which is a common practice in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
