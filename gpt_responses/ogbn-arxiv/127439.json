The use of Sum of Squares proofs and SDPs suggests a connection to optimization and information theory. The paper also mentions algorithms based on clustering and spectral methods, which are common in data science and computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SD (Systems and Control), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
