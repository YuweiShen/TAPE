Therefore, the most likely category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The paper also involves robotics, which makes cs.RO (Robotics) a likely category. The use of augmented reality involves computer vision, which makes cs.CV (Computer Vision) a possible category. The paper also involves swarm intelligence, which makes cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) a possible category.
