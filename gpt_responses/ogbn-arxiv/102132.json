The use of random mapping and the derivation of analytic bounds suggest a focus on network information theory (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The simulation-based bounds and the comparison with other coding schemes suggest a focus on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
