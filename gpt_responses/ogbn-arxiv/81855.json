It proposes a heterogeneous approach where OLAP transactions are outsourced to run on separate (virtual) snapshots while OLTP transactions run on the most recent representation of the database. The paper also introduces a custom system call vm_snapshot to overcome the restrictions of the OS and enable fine-granular snapshot creation at very high frequencies. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DB (Database), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.OS (Operating Systems), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
