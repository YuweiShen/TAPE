The use of erasure codes for distributed storage is related to information theory (cs.IT), while the optimization of repair bandwidth and storage overhead is related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The flexibility in repair and the fast encoding properties are also relevant to systems and networking (cs.SI) and network information theory (cs.NI). Therefore, these five sub-categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
