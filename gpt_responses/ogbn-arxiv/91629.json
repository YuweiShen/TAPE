The focus is on normalisation and conditioning of discrete probability distributions, which are topics that are commonly studied in the areas of information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of these concepts in quantitative information flow (cs.AI, cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
