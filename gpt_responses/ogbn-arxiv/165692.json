Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with shape space, which is a geometric concept, suggesting that cs.GR (Graphics) is also a likely sub-category. The use of automated landmark detection methods and training methods also suggests that cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes an effective training method, which involves disturbing the automatically detected landmarks, indicating that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
