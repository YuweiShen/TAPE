The use of large antenna arrays and compressed sensing techniques also suggests a possible fit with signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM) categories. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed approach in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and channel coherence time, which could be relevant to communication and networking (cs.COM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
