This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory sub-category.\n2. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper deals with a communication system using multi-antenna modulation, which is a key area of research in communication and networking.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents low-complexity iterative algorithms for the detection of large-dimensional STIM signals, which is a system-level problem.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a wireless communication system, which is a key area of research in networking and internet architecture.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with a modulation scheme that can be used for transmitting multimedia data, which suggests that it could belong to the Multimedia sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
