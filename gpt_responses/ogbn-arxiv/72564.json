The proposed approach involves integrating gaze information into CNN-based architectures as an attention mechanism, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper focuses on predicting categories and attributes of search targets, which is a problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method, which involves studying the integration of temporal and spatial gaze information, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper proposes an experimental setup and dataset, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM), and discusses the potential for future research in the gaze-based prediction of mental states, which is a topic in human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
