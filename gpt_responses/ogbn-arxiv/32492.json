The paper also uses image sequences, which can be considered as a form of computer graphics (cs.GR). The proposed method involves the use of residual encoding, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also involves building segment voting, which can be considered as a form of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
