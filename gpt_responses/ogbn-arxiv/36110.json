The use of linear least squares to solve the bilinear inverse problem is a technique commonly used in information theory (cs.IT), while the applications in imaging sciences and signal processing suggest a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SP). The paper also discusses the use of algorithms for real-time deployment, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
