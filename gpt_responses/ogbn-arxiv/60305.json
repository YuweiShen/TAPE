This work is related to computational linguistics (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG) as it uses neural networks. Additionally, it involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it uses machine learning techniques to simulate language learning. The paper also touches on the topic of natural language processing (cs.NE) as it deals with inflectional morphology. Finally, the paper discusses the stability of irregularity over time, which can be considered a topic in systems and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
