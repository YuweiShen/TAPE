The method is evaluated on image classification tasks, indicating a likely connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the optimization process and model capacity, suggesting a potential connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories.
