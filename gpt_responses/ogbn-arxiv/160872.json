Additionally, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of information retrieval techniques, which could place it in the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category.
