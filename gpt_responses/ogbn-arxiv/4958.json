Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the use of pre-trained sentence embeddings and gradient boosting model suggests a focus on machine learning, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also mentions the potential use of the model in argument search engines, indicating a possible connection to information retrieval (cs.IR) and computational social science (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
