The paper discusses methods for improving the relevance of generated questions, which falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). Specifically, the paper proposes two methods to address the issue of generic and undiversified questions in neural seq2seq based question generation. These methods involve prioritizing words that are morphologically close to words in the input passage and selecting questions that are preferred by both the QA and QG model. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning), which are all relevant to NLP and ML. The sub-categories cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are also possible, as they involve techniques that are relevant to the proposed methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
