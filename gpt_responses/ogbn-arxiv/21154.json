It proposes a method to generate an image phylogeny tree using basis functions to model the relationship between near-duplicate images. This work involves extensive experiments across different modalities, configurations, and types of transformations. The paper also analyzes the ability of each basis function to model arbitrary transformations and distinguish between original and transformed images. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
