The paper also discusses the challenges of offloading DNNs to the cloud, which suggests a focus on distributed computing (cs.DC). The proposed framework, Edgent, involves collaboration between devices and the edge, which suggests a focus on networking and communication (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the optimization of DNN inference, which suggests a focus on optimization and control (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
