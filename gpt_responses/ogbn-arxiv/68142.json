The paper proposes a deep learning model that combines 3D ConvNets and RNNs, which is a typical approach in the machine learning subfield of deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions that the proposed model avoids the need for hand-tuned parameters, which is a typical feature of the artificial intelligence subfield of automated machine learning (cs.AI). The paper also mentions that the proposed model is faster, which is a typical feature of the robotics subfield of real-time systems (cs.RO).
