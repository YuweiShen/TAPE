This involves a structured approach to arguing the quality of neural networks, including dependability metrics, formal reasoning engines, and runtime monitoring. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the development of neural networks for autonomous driving systems, which falls under the umbrella of AI. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a toolbox for safety engineering of neural networks, which involves a structured approach to building software. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper focuses on the development of neural networks for autonomous driving systems, which is a subfield of robotics. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of neural networks for autonomous driving systems, which is a subfield of machine learning. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the development of neural networks for safety-critical autonomous driving systems, which involves systems and control considerations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
