Additionally, the paper presents experimental results on image classification tasks, which are commonly studied in the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the generalization performance of the ELU compared to other activation functions, which is a topic of interest in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of ELUs in deep learning models is also relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on image classification tasks and the use of deep neural networks suggests that it may also be relevant to the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-category, as deep learning models are commonly used in this field as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
