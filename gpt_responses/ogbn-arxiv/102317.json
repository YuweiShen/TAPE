The paper also evaluates the proposed framework on three different robot platforms. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper uses Gaussian processes to model the stiffness distribution and active learning to direct the palpation path of the robot. Computer vision techniques may be used to process the sensor data obtained during the palpation process. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses active learning to direct the palpation path of the robot and maximize an acquisition function. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses Gaussian processes to model the stiffness distribution and active learning to direct the palpation path of the robot. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper considers uncertainties in robot position and sensor measurements and incorporates prior information about the location of stiff inclusions while respecting the robot-kinematics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
