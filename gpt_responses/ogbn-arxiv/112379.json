The authors also use machine learning techniques to predict human scores of image realism, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of human labels and inter-rater agreement, which are relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
