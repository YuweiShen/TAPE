The paper also focuses on fact verification using structured evidence such as tables and databases, which falls under the subfield of database systems (cs.DB). The two models proposed in the paper, Table-BERT and LPA, both involve machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, which are covered by the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper also involves information retrieval techniques, as it aims to verify the truthfulness of statements based on evidence, which is covered by the subfield of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
