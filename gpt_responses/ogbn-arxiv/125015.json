The application highlighted in the paper is applying computer vision on Q-Q plot to construct a new test statistic for normality test. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new deep-learning method for constructing test statistics, which falls under the scope of machine learning.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper applies computer vision techniques to analyze Q-Q plots, which falls under the scope of computer vision.\n- cs.ST (Statistics): The paper proposes a new method for hypothesis testing, which falls under the scope of statistics.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new method for constructing test statistics using deep learning, which falls under the scope of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper proposes a new method for constructing test statistics, which may involve the development of new software tools for implementation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
