This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with set theory, which is a branch of mathematical logic, indicating that it could also belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. The use of algorithms for synthesizing formulas also suggests that the paper could belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category.
