The use of cooperative techniques to mitigate interference is a common approach in wireless communication, making cs.NI another likely category. The paper also deals with secrecy constraints, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The use of stochastic encoding and cooperative precoding also involves signal processing techniques (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with the optimization of the secure sum capacity, which is a problem in game theory and optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
