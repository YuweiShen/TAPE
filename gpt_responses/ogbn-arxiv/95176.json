The paper presents algorithms for this problem in various settings, including sequential, cut query, and streaming. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Other likely sub-categories include cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
