The use of natural language processing techniques to extract relevant concepts from text descriptions also suggests a connection to computational linguistics (cs.CL). The use of weakly annotated web data for concept discovery and training is a common approach in multimedia analysis (cs.MM). Finally, the proposed algorithm for pruning irrelevant concepts involves machine learning techniques, which suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
