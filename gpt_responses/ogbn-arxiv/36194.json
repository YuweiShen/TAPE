The paper describes a new rank-select index that occupies a small amount of space and executes rank and select queries in constant time. This is a classic problem in data structures and algorithms, and is likely to be of interest to researchers in several subfields of computer science. Based on the abstract, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), followed by cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
