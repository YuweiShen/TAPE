The use of RNN-based models and vector averaging also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation benchmarks mentioned in the abstract also suggest a possible focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
