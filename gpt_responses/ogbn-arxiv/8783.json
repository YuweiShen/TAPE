The paper proposes a solution based on controlled invariance, which is a common technique used in robotics. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper formulates the visibility maintenance problem as a linear constrained regulation problem with additive disturbances, which is a classic problem in systems and control. The paper also introduces positive D-invariance conditions for linear uncertain systems with parametric disturbance matrix, which is a common technique used in control theory. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not explicitly use machine learning techniques, but the problem of visibility maintenance for a leader-follower pair of vehicles is a common problem in autonomous driving, which is a popular application of machine learning. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper does not explicitly use AI techniques, but the problem of visibility maintenance for a leader-follower pair of vehicles is a common problem in autonomous driving, which is a popular application of AI. \n5. cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper does not deal with software engineering, but the proposed solution can be implemented in software, and the simulation results are provided to illustrate the theory and show the effectiveness of the approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
