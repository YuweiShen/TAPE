This involves inferring a cost function that explains expert-demonstrated navigation behavior while relying only on observations and state-control trajectory used by the expert. The paper also proposes an efficient motion-planning algorithm such as A* or RRT to obtain a closed-form subgradient of the cost-to-go over a subset of promising states. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the paper involves developing a cost function representation using IRL, cs.RO (Robotics) as the paper focuses on autonomous navigation in unknown environments, cs.LG (Machine Learning) as the paper involves learning from demonstration, cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the paper involves using observations for navigation, and cs.SY (Systems and Control) as the paper involves developing a control policy for navigation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
