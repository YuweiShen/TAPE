This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The proposed model uses graph neural networks to capture relations among body-joints and body-parts, which is a popular technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments are conducted on datasets related to motion capture (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
