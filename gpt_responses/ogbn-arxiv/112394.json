It also mentions the need for legal compliance and enforceability of smart contracts, which are relevant topics in cryptography and security. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper analyzes the applicability of blockchain and DLT for public registries and governance, which are topics related to the impact of technology on society. It also discusses the multidisciplinary approach required to address the technical and legal challenges of implementing blockchain in real estate. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper mentions the need for a proper architecture of overlaid technologies to support changes of outdated and mistaken data, which is a topic related to database management. It also discusses the scalability of the ledger, which is a concern in distributed databases. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, it discusses the technical requirements for implementing blockchain and DLT, which may involve machine learning techniques for data analysis and processing. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the constraints and challenges of implementing blockchain and DLT in real estate and property rights, which are topics related to software engineering. It also mentions the need for further research and development in this space, which is a common theme in software engineering research"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
