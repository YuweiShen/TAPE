The paper also introduces novel architectures and training procedures, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of limited bounding box annotations suggests a focus on object detection and localization, which is a sub-topic of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the mention of feature space expansion suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
