The paper also mentions the use of over-segmented meshes, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed algorithms also involve planning and decision-making, which are key areas in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of real-world roadmaps, which is a common technique in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves data storage and management, which is a common area in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
