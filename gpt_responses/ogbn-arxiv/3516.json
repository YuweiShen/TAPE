The paper also proposes a deep learning model (Convolutional Neural Network) to address this problem, which falls under the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it considers visual relationships as phrases with three components.
