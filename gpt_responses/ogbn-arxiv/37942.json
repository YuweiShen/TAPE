It also touches upon congestion control and resource management, which are important topics in network architecture. \n\nIt could also belong to the sub-category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) as it discusses the use of overpressure valves to prevent congestion and ensure secure content dissemination. \n\nDistributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) is another possible sub-category as the paper explores the use of NDN's multipath and content-lookup capabilities to improve content distribution efficiency. \n\nSocial and Information Networks (cs.SI) is a potential sub-category as the paper discusses the use of an implicit feedback mechanism to decrease the fraction of traffic forwarded via congested nodes. \n\nFinally, Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) could be a relevant sub-category as the paper proposes a new probability-based forwarding strategy for NDN, which involves intelligent guidance and distribution of Interests through network crossings."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
