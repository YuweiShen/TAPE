The paper involves the development of a gesture communication language (CADDIAN) and a hierarchical classification approach for hand gesture recognition based on stereo imagery and multi-descriptor aggregation to specifically cope with underwater image artifacts. This work involves the use of computer vision, robotics, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, and graphics. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.RO (Robotics), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
