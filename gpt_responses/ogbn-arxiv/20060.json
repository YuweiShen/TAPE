This involves numerical analysis (NA) techniques such as projection-based model reduction and quadrature rules. The paper also discusses the efficiency of the algorithm, which falls under computational engineering (CE). The use of reduced order quadratures for parameterized functions is relevant to scientific computing (SC) and control systems (SY). Finally, the paper involves the use of a greedy algorithm, which is a common technique in data structures and algorithms (DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
