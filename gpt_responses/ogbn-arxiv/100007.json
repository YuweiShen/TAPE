The paper uses ray tracing and statistical modeling techniques to develop an intra-cluster model that accounts for diffuse scattering. This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), multimedia (cs.MM), systems and control (cs.SY), and physics (cs.PHYS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
