The use of genetic programming and optimization search engines also suggests a focus on machine learning and optimization techniques. The analysis of separability in engineering equations and the development of a mathematical model may fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the application of the proposed method to engineering problems suggests a potential fit for computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
