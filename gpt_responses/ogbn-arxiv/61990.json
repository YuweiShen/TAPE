The paper also introduces an extension to the SPARQL query language, which involves the use of context-free grammars, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the proposed extension, which is a topic commonly studied in the field of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS).
