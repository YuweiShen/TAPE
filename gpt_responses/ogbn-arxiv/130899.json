This suggests a symbolic computation aspect to the paper. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper's focus on the recovery of a function from limited evaluations may have applications in control systems. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper may involve discussions on the computational complexity of the algorithm proposed. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper may involve discussions on the information-theoretic aspects of sparse interpolation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
