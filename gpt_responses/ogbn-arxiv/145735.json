The use of sparse random matrices also suggests a connection to compressed sensing (cs.DS) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper presents a unified framework that encompasses several existing results, which could be seen as a contribution to the theory of algorithms (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
