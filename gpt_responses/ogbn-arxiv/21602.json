Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of these networks on the MNIST dataset, which is a common benchmark dataset in the machine learning community. \n\nThe paper also touches on the topics of neural networks (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it discusses the behavior of different activation functions and initialization schemes in the context of residual networks. \n\nFinally, the paper makes mathematical contributions by deriving new identities for the kernels of ReLU functions, which could potentially fall under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
