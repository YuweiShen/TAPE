This topic falls under the area of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also uses a unifying framework of combined belief-propagation and mean-field, which is commonly used in statistical inference (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the receiver in terms of mean-squared error and bit error rate, which are metrics commonly used in multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
