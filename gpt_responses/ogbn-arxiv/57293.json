The paper also discusses the VLSI architecture used to implement the algorithm, which falls under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR). Additionally, the paper proposes a double thresholding scheme as a fast approximate-sorting method, which could be considered a type of algorithmic optimization (cs.ET) or data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the applicability of polar codes in high-throughput and latency-sensitive applications, which could be considered a systems perspective (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
