The proposed approach involves a cost-sensitive deep neural network that learns robust feature representations for both majority and minority classes. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
