The paper uses linear regression models to test the hypothesis on a corpus of 123,128 WoS publications authored by Italian scientists. The paper's focus on citation analysis and impact factor makes it most likely to belong to the sub-categories of Digital Libraries (cs.DL), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper's use of linear regression models and statistical analysis makes it relevant to the sub-categories of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) and Computers and Society (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
