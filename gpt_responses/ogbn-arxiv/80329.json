Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves hardware design and implementation, which suggests the category cs.AR (Hardware Architecture). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of electromagnetic emission, which falls under the category cs.ET (Emerging Technologies). The paper also involves software applications that dynamically control the voltage and frequency regulators, which suggests the category cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper discusses attacks on a heterogeneous SoC, which falls under the category cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
