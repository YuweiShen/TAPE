The use of fast SVRG based approximate system solvers suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves analyzing the sample complexity of the algorithms, which is a topic in theoretical computer science (cs.DS). The use of shift-and-invert preconditioning and the analysis of eigenvalue gaps suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
