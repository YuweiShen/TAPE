The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. The attention mechanism used in the proposed method indicates that it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. The use of skeleton sequences suggests that it could belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the proposed Global Long-sequence Attention Network (GLAN) and Sub-Sequence Attention Network (SSAN) suggest that it could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
