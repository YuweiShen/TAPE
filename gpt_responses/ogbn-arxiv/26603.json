This falls under the purview of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the design of resource allocation algorithms for a multiuser MISO downlink system. This involves networking and internet architecture aspects. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper formulates the resource allocation problem as a non-convex optimization problem and proposes suboptimal schemes. This involves systems and control aspects. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the transmission of information over a wireless channel, which can be considered as a form of multimedia communication. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper focuses on secure communication and considers the use of artificial noise to combat potential eavesdroppers. This falls under the purview of cryptography and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
