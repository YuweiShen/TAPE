The paper also discusses the use of external stimulation to steer the dynamics of the network, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of learning rules to train the network, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of the network for an embodied application, specifically a simulated robot, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses the use of Hebbian learning, which is a common technique in systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
