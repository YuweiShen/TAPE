Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves modeling statistical CSI, which falls under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The use of minorize-maximize algorithm and deterministic equivalent method suggests the paper may also belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper deals with massive MIMO, which is a subfield of cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper involves optimization algorithms, which is a topic in cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
