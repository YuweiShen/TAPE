The use of combinatorial structures in the proposed algorithms suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The analysis of regret lower bounds and scaling with decision space dimension suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category.
