The paper proposes a new decoding unit for polar codes and a multi-mode decoder that provides a flexible tradeoff between latency, throughput, and error performance. These are all topics that fall under the purview of information theory.\n\n2. cs.ET (Embedded Systems): The paper proposes a hardware implementation of the polar decoder, which is a topic that falls under the purview of embedded systems. The paper discusses the area efficiency of the decoder, which is an important consideration in embedded systems.\n\n3. cs.AR (Architecture): The paper proposes a new architecture for the polar decoder, which is a topic that falls under the purview of architecture. The paper discusses the area efficiency of the decoder and proposes a multi-mode decoder that adapts to different throughput and latency requirements, which are important considerations in architecture.\n\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new decoding unit for polar codes, which is a topic that falls under the purview of data structures and algorithms. The paper discusses the distribution of frozen bits of polar codes and takes advantage of the distribution to reduce the complexity of the decoding unit, which is an algorithmic optimization.\n\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a multi-mode decoder that adapts to different throughput"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
