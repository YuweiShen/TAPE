The use of decision feedback detection also suggests a potential connection to the signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on optimizing performance metrics such as bit error rate and mutual information suggests a potential connection to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
