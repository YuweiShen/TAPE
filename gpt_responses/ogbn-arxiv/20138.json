Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the design and training of CNNs, which falls under the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of automatic or weakly-supervised reranking techniques, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the paper mentions the use of publicly available datasets, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
