The use of deep learning algorithms for image segmentation is also relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of traditional methods for comparison, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) or deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
