The use of a new tool and experimental results suggest a focus on computational aspects, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or machine learning (cs.LG). The problem of reducing the search space is also relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
