The paper focuses on the safety of the system, which is a key concern in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of model predictive control (MPC) for motion planning is a common technique in robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the integration of two different types of models, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
