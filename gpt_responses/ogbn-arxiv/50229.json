Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The problem also involves optimization of a submodular function, which suggests categories such as cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the use of an approximate oracle, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper's focus on online social networks suggests cs.SOC (Computers and Society) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
