The study also aims to identify artefacts of forensic interest, which can be used to investigate criminal activities. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the artefacts of instant messaging applications on Windows 8.1 devices, which involves the distributed and parallel computing aspects of data storage and retrieval. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the potential impact of instant messaging applications on society, particularly in the context of criminal investigations and civil litigation. The study also highlights the importance of forensic practitioners possessing up-to-date knowledge about artefacts of forensic interest. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper discusses the data remnants of instant messaging applications, which can be considered as a formal language or automata. The study aims to identify the types of artefacts that are likely to remain after the use of instant messaging services and app on Windows 8.1 devices. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the potential impact of instant messaging applications on human-computer interaction, particularly in the context of criminal investigations and civil litigation.
