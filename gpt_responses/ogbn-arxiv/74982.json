This suggests that the paper is likely to be related to machine learning techniques for recommendation systems. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the properties of complex networks and how hyperbolic geometry is a more suitable underlying geometry for many recommendation systems. This suggests that the paper is likely to be related to social and information networks. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper presents a recommender system that is based on hyperbolic geometry and uses the Einstein midpoint to define an asymmetric recommender system in hyperbolic space. This suggests that the paper is likely to be related to information retrieval techniques for recommendation systems. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the fundamental milestones and insights that the authors have gained from the development of their hyperbolic recommender system. This suggests that the paper is likely to be related to data structures and algorithms for recommendation systems. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the scalability of their hyperbolic recommender system, which allows them to scale to millions of users and hundreds of thousands of items.
