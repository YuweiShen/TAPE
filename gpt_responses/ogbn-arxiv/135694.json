It also involves the use of neural networks to estimate the intrinsic rewards and to learn from past experiences. Additionally, it could be classified as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) because it deals with the development of intelligent agents that can learn from their environment. It could also be related to robotics (cs.RO) since the exploration of unknown environments is a crucial problem in robotics. Computer vision (cs.CV) is another possible sub-category since the Atari games used for evaluation are visual environments. Finally, it could be classified as neural networks (cs.NE) since the proposed technique involves the use of neural networks for both intrinsic reward estimation and experience replay."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
