The use of deep learning techniques for image processing also suggests that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper proposes an end-to-end learning approach, which involves training a neural network to perform fusion without the need for ground truth fused images, indicating that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of image structural similarity (SSIM) as a metric for fused image quality evaluation suggests that it could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with image processing and evaluation, which could also make it relevant to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
