The use of qualitative information and the focus on maximizing agreements and minimizing disagreements suggest that the paper may also fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the mention of polynomial time approximation schemes suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
