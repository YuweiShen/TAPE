Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper discusses the training of neural networks, which falls under the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also introduces new activation functions, which could be relevant to the sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
