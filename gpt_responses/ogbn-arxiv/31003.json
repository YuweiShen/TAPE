This topic is closely related to information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML), which are both sub-categories of computer science. Additionally, the paper employs artificial neural networks, which are a type of deep learning (DL) technique, and the experiments show that the proposed method out-performs state-of-the-art methods, indicating a focus on machine learning and data analysis (LG). The paper also mentions scientometrics, informetrics, and bibliometrics, which are sub-fields of information science (SI) that deal with the quantitative analysis of scientific publications. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IR, cs.DL, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.SI, in descending order of likelihood."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
