Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also introduces a new concept of \"congestible capacity\" and proposes an offline-online estimation method to capture the structural effects of flows on capacities, which involves the use of optimization and information theory techniques.
