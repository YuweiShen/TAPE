The paper also discusses the scalability issues of the algorithm and proposes a stochastic version of the kernel with provable approximation guarantees. The experiments are conducted on several graph classification benchmarks, which suggests that the paper could be relevant to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new graph kernel and evaluates it on several graph classification benchmarks, which falls under the scope of machine learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new graph kernel that could be useful for various AI applications that involve graph data. \n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper discusses the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm, which is a popular graph isomorphism test and falls under the scope of discrete mathematics. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the scalability issues of the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm and proposes a stochastic version of the kernel with provable approximation guarantees, which falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper evaluates the proposed graph kernel on several graph classification benchmarks, which could be relevant to computer vision and pattern recognition applications that involve graph"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
