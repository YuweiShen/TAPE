The proposed method involves the use of optimal transport theory, which is also relevant to optimization (cs.NE) and statistics (cs.SD). Additionally, the paper discusses the theoretical analysis of the generalization performance of the proposed method, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
