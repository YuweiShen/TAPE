The use of thermal images is a key aspect of the proposed method, which could also be of interest to researchers in the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) communities. Finally, the paper also presents a new dataset and a novel calibration method, which could be relevant to researchers in the multimedia (cs.MM) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
