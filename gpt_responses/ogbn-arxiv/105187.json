The focus on ReLU activations suggests that the paper may be more relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) or natural language processing (cs.CL), but the abstract does not provide enough information to confirm this. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
