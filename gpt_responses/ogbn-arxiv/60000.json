It also focuses on minimizing communication and local computation, which are important aspects of distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper presents a new scheme for secure multiparty computation, which involves Boolean circuits, a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the theoretical and practical improvements of their scheme, which involves analyzing the complexity of the protocol, a topic in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and using encryption schemes, a topic in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
