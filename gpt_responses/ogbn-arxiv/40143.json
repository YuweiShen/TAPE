The proposed approach leverages device-level caching along with the capabilities of dual-mode base stations to minimize handover failures, reduce inter-frequency measurement energy consumption, and provide seamless mobility in emerging dense heterogeneous networks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). \n\nThe paper also deals with the achievable rate of caching for mobile users, which falls under the sub-category of cs.IT (Information Theory). The use of mmW frequencies and the integration of dual-mode base stations also falls under the sub-category of cs.MM (Multimedia). \n\nThe proposed cache-enabled mobility management problem is formulated as a dynamic matching game between mobile user equipments (MUEs) and small base stations (SBSs), which falls under the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper proposes a novel algorithm to solve the dynamic matching problem, which falls under the sub-category of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
