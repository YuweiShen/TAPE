It also involves the use of binary domination, which is a concept from coding theory (cs.CC). The paper may also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and data structures (cs.DS) due to the discussion of circular-buffer rate matching. Finally, the paper may have implications for machine learning (cs.LG) as polar codes have been used in deep learning applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
