The use of optimization algorithms suggests that numerical analysis (cs.NA) may also be relevant. The paper also deals with system capacity and convergence performance, which are topics in control systems (cs.SY). The use of manifolds suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.MM) and/or linear algebra (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
