This involves encoding relational information between words in the question and answer as embeddings with additional parameters. This paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics, which is directly relevant to the topic of this paper. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers a broad range of topics related to AI, including machine learning and natural language processing, which are both relevant to this paper. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers topics related to machine learning, which is the main technique used in this paper. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category deals with techniques for retrieving relevant information from large collections of data, which is relevant to the task of answer sentence selection. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category covers topics related to neural networks and other computational models inspired by biological systems, which is relevant to the use of convolutional neural networks in this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
