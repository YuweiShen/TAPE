The paper proposes two convex relaxations to the problem based on trust regions and soft constraints, which are optimization techniques commonly used in robotics and machine learning. The paper also mentions the use of trajectory optimization techniques, which are commonly used in robotics and control theory. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves optimization and machine learning techniques, which are covered by sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
