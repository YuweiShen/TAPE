The use of computational imaging techniques such as compressive light field and coded aperture also suggests that the paper could be categorized under multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the use of deep learning algorithms for image processing and rendering indicates that the paper could also be classified under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the application of the proposed framework for capturing high-resolution light fields using conventional cameras suggests that the paper could also be categorized under robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
