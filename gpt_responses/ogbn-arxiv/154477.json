This category is therefore a likely fit for this paper.\n2. cs.NE (Networks and Internet Architecture): The problem of routing in graphs is also a fundamental problem in network design and optimization. This category is therefore another likely fit for this paper.\n3. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The problem of routing in graphs involves combinatorial and graph-theoretic concepts such as edge-disjoint paths and congestion. This category is therefore a possible fit for this paper.\n4. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The problem of routing in graphs can also be viewed as a game-theoretic problem, where the goal is to maximize the number of source-sink pairs that can be routed subject to congestion constraints. This category is therefore another possible fit for this paper.\n5. cs.RO (Robotics): Although not directly related to robotics, the problem of routing in graphs can be viewed as a planning problem, where the goal is to find a feasible path for each source-sink pair subject to congestion constraints.
