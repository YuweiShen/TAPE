The use of min-hashing and locality sensitive hashing (LSH) also suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper's focus on scalable approximation algorithms and similarity measures could also place it in the sub-field of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
