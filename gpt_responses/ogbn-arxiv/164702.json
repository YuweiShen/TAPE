This involves optimizing the primary transmission rate while minimizing system overheads. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also uses deep reinforcement learning, which falls under the category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with information theory and coding, which falls under the category of cs.IT (Information Theory). The proposed algorithm also involves optimizing a trade-off between primary transmission rate and system overheads, which can be seen as a machine learning problem and falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper deals with control and optimization of a complex system, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
