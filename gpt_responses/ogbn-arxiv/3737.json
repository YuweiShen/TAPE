The algorithms are evaluated on social, web and citation network datasets. \n\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a multi-scale approach for encoding attribute-neighborhood relationships in network embeddings. The embeddings are shown to implicitly factorize matrices of node-feature pointwise mutual information. \n\n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper's approach is similar to Skip-gram, a popular algorithm for learning word embeddings in natural language processing. The paper's algorithms are evaluated on citation network datasets, which are commonly used in information retrieval research. \n\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper's algorithms are designed to efficiently compute network embeddings by pooling or encoding information from neighborhoods of different sizes. The paper's experiments show that the algorithms are computationally efficient and outperform comparable models. \n\n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - The paper's approach is based on Skip-gram, a popular algorithm for learning word embeddings in natural language processing. The paper's algorithms are evaluated on web datasets, which are commonly used in computational linguistics research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
