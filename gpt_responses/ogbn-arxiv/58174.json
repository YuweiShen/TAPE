The use of asynchronous transmission is a common technique in networking (cs.NI) to improve performance and reduce congestion. The paper also discusses the reliability function, which is a concept in statistical inference (cs.SI). The use of delay in transmission is a form of flow control, which is a topic in computer communication (cs.CC). Finally, the paper mentions numerical evaluation, which involves computation and simulation, a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
