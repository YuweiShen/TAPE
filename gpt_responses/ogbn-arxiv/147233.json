The use of automated reasoning technologies such as satisfiability and optimization modulo theories suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper also addresses limitations in existing techniques for coping with complex real-world problems, indicating a potential fit with software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the experimental evaluation suggests a potential fit with data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) for scalability testing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
