The use of time-reversal maximum-ratio combining reception strategy suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The analysis of the impact of phase noise on the effective channel and the number of scheduled users indicates a possible connection to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the use of Massive MIMO technology in the study suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
