It also involves the use of reinforcement learning, which falls under the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of Deep-Q Networks suggests that it may also fall under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with scalability, which could place it under the sub-category of cs.SD (Software Engineering). Finally, the use of an information sharing mechanism suggests that it may also fall under the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
