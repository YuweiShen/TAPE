The paper also mentions the use of autoencoders, which are commonly used in neural network-based compression techniques. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of residual transformations, which are commonly used in deep learning-based image and signal processing tasks. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also discusses the hardware cost and real-time performance of the proposed model, which suggests that it could belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.IT (Information Theory). \n\nThe paper also involves the use of vector quantization, which is a technique commonly used in data compression and coding. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.SD (Sound). \n\nFinally, the paper involves the use of deep learning-based compression techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
