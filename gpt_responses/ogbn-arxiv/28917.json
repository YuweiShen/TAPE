The paper deals with natural language processing and machine learning techniques applied to structured data such as knowledge bases and tables. The most relevant sub-category is \"cs.CL\" (Computation and Language) which deals with the intersection of computer science and linguistics. \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence) is also relevant as the paper uses machine learning models. \"cs.DB\" (Databases) is relevant as the paper deals with structured data. \"cs.LG\" (Machine Learning) is relevant as the paper uses graph neural networks and pointer networks. Finally, \"cs.IR\" (Information Retrieval) is relevant as the paper deals with answering questions on structured data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
