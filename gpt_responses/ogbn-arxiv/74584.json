The paper also discusses the involvement of occupants in energy efficiency, which is a social aspect. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of data from smart meters, BMS, and ambient sensors for various applications such as demand response, fault detection, and optimizing HVAC schedules. These applications involve machine learning techniques such as clustering, classification, and regression. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the interconnection of sub-systems in buildings such as lighting, HVAC, and BMS, and the need for intelligent operations. These aspects are related to systems and control. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the optimization of energy consumption in buildings using data-driven approaches, which can be considered a computational engineering problem. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of data from smart meters, BMS, and ambient sensors for various applications such as demand response, fault detection, and optimizing HVAC schedules. These applications involve information retrieval techniques such as data mining and pattern recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
