Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of different activation functions for different neurons, which is a topic related to machine learning and optimization, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. Additionally, the paper mentions the need for more effective and faster MCNN software systems and tools, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
