The proposed framework is applicable to a variety of multiuser DC problems in different areas, ranging from signal processing (cs.IT), to communications and networking (cs.NI), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses a case study on resource allocation in physical layer security (cs.SY) and sum-rate maximization in MIMO Cognitive Radio networks (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
