This involves tuning the weights of the neural network to adjust the local relevance of each ensemble member using all labeled instances. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers topics related to the design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. The paper proposes a machine learning algorithm for anomaly detection. \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers topics related to the study and development of intelligent agents, including machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics. The paper proposes an AI-based approach to anomaly detection. \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category covers topics related to the design, analysis, and implementation of efficient algorithms and data structures for processing and storing data. The paper proposes an algorithm for anomaly detection. \n\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): This sub-category covers topics related to the design, analysis, and implementation of secure systems and protocols. Anomaly detection is an important component of security systems, and the paper proposes a new approach to this problem. \n\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category covers topics related to the analysis and interpretation of visual"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
