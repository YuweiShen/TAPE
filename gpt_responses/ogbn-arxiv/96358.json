Additionally, the paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) for learning a joint embedding space for word images and semantic concepts, which is a common approach in natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of a lexical database (WordNet) also suggests a connection to information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper's focus on learning a weighted ranking loss objective and end-to-end learning also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
