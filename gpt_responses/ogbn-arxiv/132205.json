This falls under the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also uses word embeddings, which are a popular tool in natural language processing and machine learning, indicating a possible connection to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves statistical analysis and modeling, which could fall under the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper uses data-driven approaches to investigate linguistic relativity, which could fall under the sub-category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
