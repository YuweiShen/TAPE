Therefore, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses algorithms and their performance on various problems, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The paper also mentions information theory (cs.IT) and game theory (cs.GT) in the context of unique games."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
