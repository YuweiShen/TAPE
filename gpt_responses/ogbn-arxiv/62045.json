The problem of counting and synchronizing the nodes in the network is a classic problem in Distributed Systems (cs.DS). The paper also deals with self-stabilizing algorithms, which could place it in the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category. The paper discusses the number of bits communicated, which suggests that it could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) category.
