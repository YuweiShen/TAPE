Additionally, it may also belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a method to improve the performance of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using prior knowledge. The use of weighted context-free grammar and finite-state automata also suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of Natural Language Processing (cs.NE). Finally, the intersection algorithm used to combine the grammar and automata may also suggest that it belongs to the sub-category of Symbolic Computation (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
