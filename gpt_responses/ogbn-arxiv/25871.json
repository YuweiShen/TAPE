This falls under the category of asynchronous circuits and systems (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the energy efficiency of the proposed adder, which could fall under the categories of computer architecture (cs.AR) and embedded systems (cs.ET). The design of the adder involves carry lookahead logic, which could fall under the category of computer engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the adder was implemented using CMOS technology, which could fall under the category of electromagnetics (cs.EM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
