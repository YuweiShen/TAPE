The paper also introduces a new dataset for this task, which involves capturing hand poses and shapes in real-world scenarios, which could fall under graphics (cs.GR) or robotics (cs.RO). The paper also proposes a semi-automated approach for annotating the dataset, which could involve machine learning (cs.MM) or human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
