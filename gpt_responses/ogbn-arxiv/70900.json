Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves the analysis of large amounts of data, which suggests that it could belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Additionally, the paper deals with IoT devices, which could place it in cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Finally, the implementation of the blockchain-based PKI involves software development, which could place it in cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
