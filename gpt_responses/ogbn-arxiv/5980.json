This involves integrating 2D, 3D, and temporal information to account for uncertainties arising from the discriminative model. The proposed approach uses a deep fully convolutional neural network to model the uncertainty distributions of 2D joint locations as latent variables. It also employs a sparse representation to model the unknown 3D poses and an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to estimate the 3D parameters. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are:\n\n1. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper deals with the problem of recovering 3D full-body human pose from 2D appearance, which is a core problem in computer vision.\n\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel approach that uses deep learning to model the uncertainty distributions of 2D joint locations as latent variables. It also employs an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to estimate the 3D parameters.\n\n3. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper deals with the problem of human motion capture, which is an important topic in computer graphics.\n\n4. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper proposes a method for recovering 3D full-body human pose, which has applications in robotics, such as human-robot interaction.\n\n5. cs.MM ("}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
