The proposed method involves using structural MRI data to distinguish between four categories of individuals: NC, sMCI, pMCI, and AD. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category, as it involves analyzing and processing medical images. Additionally, the use of deep learning models for classification suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The focus on brain degeneration and neuroimaging data suggests that it may also belong to the Neuroscience (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves studying the hippocampal morphology of individuals, which suggests that it may also belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
