Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the reduction of parameters in the network and the end-to-end differentiability of the trainable pooling layer, which suggests that it could also fit into categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the use of RBF neurons for quantization could place it in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and the demonstration of the approach on image datasets could make it relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
