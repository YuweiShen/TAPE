The authors propose a multi-task deep learning framework that incorporates semantic recognition as a key task to improve the accuracy of aesthetic quality assessment. This involves inter-task relationship learning, which falls under the category of multi-modal learning (cs.MM). The framework also involves parameter optimization, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of semantic information to improve aesthetic quality assessment can also be seen as a form of information retrieval (cs.IR) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
