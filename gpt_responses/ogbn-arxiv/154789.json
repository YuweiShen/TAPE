The paper presents new results on the feasibility of inferring hidden states in strongly-connected trackable weak models, which are a type of directed graph. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), or Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
