The proposed approach uses machine learning methods to improve cardinality estimation, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The approach also involves analyzing query execution statistics, which is related to data structures (cs.DS) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
