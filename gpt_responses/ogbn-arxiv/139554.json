The paper proposes two new regularization methods based on    ${\\ell _{0}}$    quasi-norm, which is a popular tool in sparse signal processing and compressive sensing. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Among these categories, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely ones, as the paper deals with a problem of learning low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data, which is a central topic in both fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
