The use of widely linear receivers and the optimization of transmit and receive waveforms are also topics that fall under these categories. The paper also discusses the exploitation of spectral correlation, which is a topic in statistical signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, the optimization problem formulation and solution techniques used in the paper are relevant to optimization and learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
