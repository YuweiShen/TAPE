The methodology involves statistical inference and machine learning techniques, which are commonly used in the fields of social network analysis (cs.SI), data mining (cs.SD), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the application of the methodology to empirical and synthetic networks, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the use of stochastic block models for network reconstruction is a common technique in network science (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
