The paper also considers the impact of dynamic obstacles on the communication channel, which falls under the category of robotics and control (cs.RO). The use of probabilistic models and analysis of probability also suggests that the paper could belong to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The use of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) antennas and radar also suggests that the paper could belong to the signal processing (cs.SP) or multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. However, since the focus of the paper is on networked systems and protocols, we believe that cs.NI is the most likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
