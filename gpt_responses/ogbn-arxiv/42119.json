The use of adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms suggests that information theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant. The study of monotonicity is closely related to machine learning and statistics, which are covered by the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
