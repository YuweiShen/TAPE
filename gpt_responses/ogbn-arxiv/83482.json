The use of caches and popularity distribution of files suggests a focus on data structures (cs.DS) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The proposed coded caching scheme involves coding theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the optimization problem and analysis of the proposed scheme involve mathematical modeling and optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
