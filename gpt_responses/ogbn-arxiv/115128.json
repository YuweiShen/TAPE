This problem is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), and statistics (cs.ST). The paper presents a general framework for analyzing this problem and proves rate optimality for several well-known algorithms. The results are likely to be of interest to researchers in all of these subfields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
