The paper uses network analysis and machine learning techniques to identify key characteristics of this ecosystem, including the pattern of new websites being established in the run-up to the elections and abandoned after, and the highly partisan manner in which user traffic is directed internally within the ecosystem. Given the focus on network analysis and machine learning, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SOC (Social and Economic Networks). Additionally, given the focus on online misinformation and propaganda, cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are also likely sub-categories. Finally, given the use of natural language processing techniques to analyze the content of hyper-partisan websites, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
