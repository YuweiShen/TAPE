The scheme is also efficient in terms of transmitted power requirements, which could fall under distributed systems (cs.DS) or data compression (cs.DC). The paper also presents a model that describes the decoding process, which could be relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) or signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
