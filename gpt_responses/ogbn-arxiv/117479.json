This involves computer vision techniques such as object detection and pose estimation. \n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper focuses on designing a lighting system that is human-centric and aims to maintain a consistent light level perception for users while saving energy. This falls under the domain of human-computer interaction. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a radiosity model to estimate the light level perceived by a person, which involves machine learning techniques. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper collects a new dataset of luxmeter readings to evaluate the performance of the proposed system, which involves data collection and analysis techniques commonly used in information retrieval. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed system involves controlling the illumination level of luminaires in an indoor environment to save energy while maintaining a consistent light level perception for users. This falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
