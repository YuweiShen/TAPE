The constant-work-space constraint is also a common theme in data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.DM). The paper also involves some graph theory concepts, such as shortest path queries, which could fall under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) or algorithms (cs.DC). Finally, the use of constant work-space algorithms could also be relevant to complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
