This topic is relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). However, given that the paper focuses on deep learning and image/video databases, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
