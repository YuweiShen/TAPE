This is motivated by the success of matrix completion algorithms that alternate over the (low-rank) factors. The paper also compares the proposed method with existing methods for data completion in computer vision settings. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, since the paper analyzes the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm and proposes a spectral initialization, it could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
