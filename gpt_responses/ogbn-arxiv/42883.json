The paper also discusses the use of error-correcting codes, which falls under the coding theory (cs.CC) sub-field. The generalization of the channel resolvability technique mentioned in the paper is related to the study of discrete structures (cs.DS), and the practical construction techniques for SMC may involve the use of algorithms and data structures (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
