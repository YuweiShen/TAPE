The focus is on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and speech recognition (cs.SD). The paper also discusses the use of QRNN and SRU, which are specific types of RNNs, and therefore could be categorized under cs.NE (neural and evolutionary computing) and cs.AR (computer vision and pattern recognition). Finally, the paper discusses the reduction of power consumption, which could be categorized under cs.EM (embedded systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
