Additionally, the use of standard embedding evaluation metrics and datasets further supports this categorization. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which could place it in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Information Retrieval (cs.IR) could also be a possible sub-category as word embeddings are often used in information retrieval tasks. Finally, Neural Networks (cs.NE) could be another possible sub-category as word embeddings are often trained using neural network models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
