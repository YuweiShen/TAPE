The use of multiresolution techniques is also a common approach in image processing and computer graphics (cs.GR). The incorporation of a Lipschitz global optimization framework suggests a focus on optimization and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper also mentions the detection of reflective symmetry, which falls under the category of image analysis and signal processing (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
