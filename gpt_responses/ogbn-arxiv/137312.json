It introduces a MoD system where pick-ups and drop-offs can only occur in a limited subset of admitted stop locations, and tests the system in AMoDSim, an open-source simulator. The paper also discusses the shift in operational mode from a taxi-like door-to-door service to a bus-like service, with few served stops and more passengers on-board. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), followed by cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
