Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces new mechanisms to improve the performance of the tracker, which involves estimating angles and masking spatial features, indicating a potential fit for cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper focuses on real-time tracking, which suggests a possible fit for cs.RO (Robotics and Control) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
