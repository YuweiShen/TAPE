This topic falls under the area of computational complexity theory (cs.CC) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the discrete Fourier transform, which falls under information theory (cs.IT). The study of tensor networks and their applications in computational complexity and optimization is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG) and scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
