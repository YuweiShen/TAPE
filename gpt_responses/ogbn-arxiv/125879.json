Computational geometry often deals with problems on geometric graphs, which can be sparse. \n4. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): Game theory often deals with problems on graphs, and the Minimum Dominating Set problem can be viewed as a game where the dominating set tries to control the graph. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The Minimum Dominating Set problem is relevant in networking, as it can be used to model the problem of selecting a minimum set of nodes to monitor a network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
