The use of Fourier analysis on lattices is a key component of the constructions, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfields of information theory (cs.IT) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the unique shortest vector problem, which is a well-known problem in computational complexity theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper introduces a new public key cryptosystem and hash function, which are both examples of computational engineering (cs.CE) applications of lattice-based cryptography."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
