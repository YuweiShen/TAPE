The use of statistical physics tools suggests a possible connection to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG), while the study of large-scale problems points to numerical analysis (cs.NA) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the mention of multi-measurement vector (MMV) problems suggests a possible connection to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
