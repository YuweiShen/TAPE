The focus on new waveforms and their implementation in a Matlab toolbox suggests a strong emphasis on signal processing and implementation, which is more closely related to cs.IT and cs.COMM. However, the paper also touches on the challenges of adoption and standardization, which could fall under cs.SY and cs.NI. Finally, the mention of multimedia applications suggests a potential connection to cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
