The paper also involves the study of combinatorial structures such as designs and graphs (cs.DS), which are often used in the analysis of hash families. Additionally, the paper presents new bounds and constructions, which are topics of interest in computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
