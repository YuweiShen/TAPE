Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SD (Sound), followed by cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the use of robust inference and multi-frame inference, which are related to control and systems engineering, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible sub-category.
