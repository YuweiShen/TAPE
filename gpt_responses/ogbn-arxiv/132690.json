The proposed method involves the use of structured output SVM and deep convolution neural networks (CNNs), which are both related to machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of a multimodal target detection technique, which involves the use of multiple modalities, such as color and texture, to improve target localization precision, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of feedback to avoid model corruption, which is related to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper mentions the use of circulant feature maps, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
