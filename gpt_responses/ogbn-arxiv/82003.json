It also proposes various operators for expressing global constraints and deduction capabilities, which are commonly used in AI applications. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category as it introduces a lightweight implementation of stratified reasoning for logical connectives, which is a fundamental concept in programming languages. \n\nThe Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category is also a likely fit as the paper deals with logical connectors and reasoning. \n\nThe Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category is a possible fit as the paper discusses the use of constructive reasoning for domain pruning during constraint filtering, which is a common problem in algorithm design. \n\nFinally, the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category is a possible fit as the paper proposes an open-source library built on top of SICStus Prolog clp(fd), which is a software engineering tool commonly used for constraint programming."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
