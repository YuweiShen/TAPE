The paper also introduces new functionality to produce order-invariant CADs, which can be used to solve problems with equational constraints and truth-table invariance. Based on this information, the most likely sub-category is cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), followed by cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), and cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
