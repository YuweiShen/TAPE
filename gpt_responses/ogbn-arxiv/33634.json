The use of deep neural networks and GPU support suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the mention of well-calibrated uncertainties and outlier detection suggests that the paper may also be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
