The paper also mentions the need for technical and methodological support throughout the development life cycle, which could fall under the sub-field of cybernetics (cs.CY). Additionally, the paper discusses the classification of SE publications based on their relevance to different values, which could involve the use of computational methods (cs.CS). The paper also mentions user dissatisfaction and negative socio-economic impact, which could relate to the sub-field of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper discusses the need for research on human values in software engineering, which could involve the study of security and privacy (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
