The use of RGB-D data and wearable sensors also suggests a potential overlap with human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the proposed approach involves machine learning techniques for part detection and inference, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
