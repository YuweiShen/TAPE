Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper proposes a new method that involves adding non-linearity to CNNs, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The method involves using power functions with learnable parameters, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the experiments involve large scale benchmark datasets, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
