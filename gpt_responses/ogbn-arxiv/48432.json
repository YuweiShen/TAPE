The paper discusses a new algorithm for fitting multiclass GAMs, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the interpretability of GAMs in the multiclass setting, which is related to statistical modeling (cs.ST) and computational engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the paper proposes a post-processing technique for improving the interpretability of multiclass additive models, which is related to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
