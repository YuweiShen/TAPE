The paper also discusses a two-player game between nature and the code designer, which is a topic in game theory and optimization (cs.SI). The paper also examines the Gaussian and binary-erasure cases in detail, which are topics in signal processing and communication (cs.MM). The paper also presents achievable exponents and converse bounds, which are topics in information theory and coding theory (cs.DS).
