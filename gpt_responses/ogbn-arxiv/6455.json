The problem of evaluating a function by adaptively querying its variables is also related to information theory (cs.IT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), as it involves making decisions based on incomplete information. The paper also discusses trade-offs between different cost measures, which is a common topic in machine learning and optimization, making cs.LG a likely sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
