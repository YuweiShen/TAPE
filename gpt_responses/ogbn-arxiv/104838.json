This involves generating partial policies using a sampling-based motion planner that uses particle-based models of uncertainty and simulation of contact and compliance, and resilient execution that updates the planned policies to account for unexpected behavior in execution which may arise from model or environment inaccuracy. This work is highly relevant to the field of robotics, specifically in the area of manipulation, and involves techniques from robotics, artificial intelligence, control systems, and computer vision. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
