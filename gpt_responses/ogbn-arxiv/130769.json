Specifically, the authors introduce the concept of deep equilibrium models (DEQs) that find equilibrium points via root-finding. This approach is applied to two state-of-the-art deep sequence models: self-attention transformers and trellis networks. The paper focuses on language modeling tasks, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-category. However, the approach is general and can be applied to other sequential data, which could also place it in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The paper also discusses computational requirements and memory consumption, which could suggest the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. Additionally, the use of self-attention transformers and trellis networks could suggest the cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-categories, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
