This falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the paper uses a driving simulator and a driver monitoring system, which involves robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the potential risks of over-trusting the automation system, which relates to cybersecurity (cs.CYBER) and system safety (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
