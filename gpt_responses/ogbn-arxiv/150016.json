The paper proposes a novel approach to policy evaluation, which involves searching for a behavior policy that reduces mean squared error. This approach is likely to be of interest to researchers in the areas of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data science (cs.DS), software engineering (cs.SE), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
