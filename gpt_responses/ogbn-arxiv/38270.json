The paper also discusses the use of contextual reasoning in object detection, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The vulnerability of object detectors to adversarial attacks is a security concern, which is studied in the computer security (cs.CR) community. Finally, the paper presents a method for generating adversarial patches, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
