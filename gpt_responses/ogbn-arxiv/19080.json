Therefore, the most likely category is cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also focuses on the feasibility of using different input devices for the assistive grasping system, which involves human-computer interaction and human factors. Therefore, cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) is also a likely category. The paper also involves the development of a novel sEMG device, which could fall under cs.CY (Computational Biology and Bioinformatics) or cs.SD (Sound). Finally, the paper discusses the potential of sEMG-based control for severely disabled individuals, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
