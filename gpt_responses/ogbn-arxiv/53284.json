The paper proposes a novel framework for solving this problem using a partially observable Markov decision process formulation and a stochastic dynamic programming algorithm. This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper uses an innovations approach and a minimum mean-squared error filter, which are common techniques in information theory (cs.IT) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
