The methods involve the use of temporal convolutional networks and dynamic time warping for time series classification. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.DB (Databases), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
