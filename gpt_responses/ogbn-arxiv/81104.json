The paper also introduces a new subnetwork of a deep architecture and trains it end-to-end with backpropagation, which falls under the cs.LG and cs.AI sub-categories. The use of low-rank linear systems and conjugate gradients for efficient minimization of energy is related to optimization techniques covered under the cs.NE sub-category. Finally, the use of the Caffe library and GPU-based implementation is related to the cs.MM sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
