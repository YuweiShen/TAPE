This involves reducing the amount of memory required to produce the probabilistic forecast by several orders of magnitude and generating a meaningful set of analogs associated with a certain forecast in constant time without performing any search. This work involves machine learning and deep learning techniques, which are typically associated with the computer science sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SD (Software Engineering). Additionally, the paper involves statistical modeling and data analysis, which are associated with the sub-categories of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
