Additionally, the paper focuses on social dimensions of language, which could also place it under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing). The use of large-scale data-driven methods in CL also suggests a potential fit for cs.LG (Machine Learning) and the study of multilingual communication could potentially fall under cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
