The use of deep learning techniques and CNN features also suggests a strong connection to cs.MM (multimedia). The paper also proposes recommendation techniques based on language prior, which could fall under natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the use of object-level inverted indexing and re-ranking based on spatial constraints suggests a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
