Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves deep neural networks, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of hashing for efficient matching suggests cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the use of object proposals and feature extraction suggests cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
