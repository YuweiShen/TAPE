The proposed framework involves a new temporal convolutional network and a novel training strategy, which suggests that the paper may also fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the proposed framework is done on benchmark datasets, which indicates that the paper may also belong to multimedia (cs.MM) and computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
