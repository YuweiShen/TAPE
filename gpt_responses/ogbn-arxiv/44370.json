This involves translating IoT source code into an intermediate representation, extracting a state model, and applying model checking. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper deals with IoT security and safety analysis, which falls under the scope of this category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a static analysis system for validating IoT apps and environments, which is a software engineering problem.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with IoT systems and their safety and security analysis, which falls under the scope of this category.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves translating IoT source code into an intermediate representation, which is a form of information retrieval.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper involves applying model checking to verify desired properties, which is a programming language technique."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
