The problem of correlation clustering is a classic problem in theoretical computer science (cs.DM) and information theory (cs.IT). The use of linear sketches and convex programming also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
