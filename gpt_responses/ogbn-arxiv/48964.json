Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also uses deep learning techniques, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely category. The paper involves self-supervision, which is a technique used in unsupervised learning, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another possible category. The paper also involves document structuring and information retrieval, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a likely category. Finally, the paper uses visual heuristics, which could involve computer vision techniques, making cs.CV (Computer Vision) a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
