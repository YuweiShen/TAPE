This algorithm is applied to benchmark functions in the Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) LSGO competition. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), which deals with evolutionary algorithms and optimization. The paper also mentions CEC, which is a conference on computational intelligence, suggesting that it could belong to cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science). Additionally, the paper discusses optimization, which could place it in cs.OH (Optimization and Control) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper compares the proposed algorithm with other meta-heuristic algorithms, indicating that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
