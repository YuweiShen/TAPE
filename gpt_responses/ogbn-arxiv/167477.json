This involves techniques from information theory (cs.IT) and communication systems (cs.COMM), as well as signal processing (cs.SY) and wireless networking (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of amplitude-and-phase shift keying (APSK) constellations, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
