It also focuses on readability and rendering criteria, which are important factors in human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of mathematical models to encapsulate these factors suggests a focus on algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The study of real-world graphs suggests a focus on social networks and information retrieval (cs.SI). Finally, the use of bold graph drawing, which considers more realistic drawings consisting of vertices as disks and edges as rectangles, suggests a focus on computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
