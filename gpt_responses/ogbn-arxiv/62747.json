This involves information theory concepts such as channel capacity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes two operational options for the joint MIMO radar-communication system and formulates appropriate probing beampatterns while guaranteeing the performance of downlink communications. This involves control and optimization techniques. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses a system that involves both radar and communication, which can be considered as a form of multimedia. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses a system that involves communication with downlink users, which falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n5. cs.RF (Radio Frequency and Wireless Communications): The paper discusses a joint MIMO radar-communication system, which involves radio frequency and wireless communications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
