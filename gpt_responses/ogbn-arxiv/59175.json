The paper also mentions the design of decision rules for agents, which is a common topic in the cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) sub-category. The use of optimization techniques and linear programming in particular suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The paper deals with the efficiency of equilibria, which is a topic in the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category.
