It may also belong to multimedia (cs.MM) as it involves processing images. The use of deep learning techniques for feature representation suggests that it could also belong to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the use of non-local operations for capturing long-range dependencies suggests that it could also belong to graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
