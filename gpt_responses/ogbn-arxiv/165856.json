The paper focuses on the theoretical foundations and implementation of the tool for constructing data-intensive functional reactive programs. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also discusses the use of Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) for specification, which falls under the category of cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of the tool, which falls under the category of cs.SE (Software Engineering). The paper also discusses the use of functional reactive programming (FRP), which falls under the category of cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory). Finally, the paper discusses the use of temporal logic, which falls under the category of cs.ET (Emerging Technologies)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
