The use of pre-trained network models from deep learning convolution networks also involves machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) techniques. Additionally, the paper proposes a pre-clustering method, which involves clustering algorithms and optimization techniques, falling under artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
