This is a core topic in computational complexity theory. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents algorithms for solving the NECKLACE-SPLITTING and DISCRETE HAM SANDWICH problems, which fall under the purview of data structures and algorithms. \n3. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The DISCRETE HAM SANDWICH problem involves bisecting a sandwich in a geometric setting, which is a classic problem in computational geometry. \n4. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The NECKLACE-SPLITTING problem involves two thieves sharing a necklace, which can be modeled as a game-theoretic problem. \n5. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper uses techniques from discrete mathematics, such as embeddings and consensus-halving, to establish the PPA-completeness of the problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
