The concept of a stable Delaunay graph is introduced, which is a dynamic subgraph of the Delaunay triangulation, and the paper proposes two kinetic data structures for maintaining it (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the robustness of the stable Delaunay graph under small changes of the norm, which falls under the category of system and control theory (cs.SY). The paper presents several properties of the stable Delaunay graph, such as its relationship with the beta-skeleton of the point set, which is a topic in graph theory (cs.GR). Finally, the paper proposes using a polygonal norm to approximate the Euclidean norm, which is a technique commonly used in computer graphics and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
