This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also introduces a new image similarity kernel and uses support vector machines for training, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The use of local steering kernel as low-level descriptors is also related to image retrieval (cs.IR) and the proposed methodology involves the use of multichannel discrete Fourier transform, which is a common technique in multimedia processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
