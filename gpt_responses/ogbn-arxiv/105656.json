It also mentions the use of computer vision techniques for object detection and tracking. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper focuses on autonomous driving, which is a subfield of robotics. It discusses the challenges of calibrating and synchronizing multiple sensors, as well as the different driving tasks explored by the datasets. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions the use of machine learning techniques for various tasks, such as object detection, tracking, and prediction. It also discusses the importance of having large and diverse datasets for training autonomous driving systems. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of AI techniques, such as machine learning and computer vision, for various tasks in autonomous driving. It also mentions the importance of developing accurate and reliable autonomous driving systems. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): Although less likely, this category could be relevant if the paper discusses natural language processing techniques used in autonomous driving datasets, such as speech recognition for voice commands or text processing for map data. However, this is not mentioned in the abstract."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
