This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of neural networks (cs.AI) for learning the system dynamics and provides guarantees for the convergence of empirical loss (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with the analysis of mixing-time arguments (cs.DS) to approximate temporally-dependent samples by i.i.d. samples."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
