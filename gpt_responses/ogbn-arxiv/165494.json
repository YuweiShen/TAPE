The algorithm is based on symmetric nonnegative matrix trifactorization and considers intertype relationships and intratype information. The paper also presents extensive experiments on documents, images, and gene expression data sets. Based on this information, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
