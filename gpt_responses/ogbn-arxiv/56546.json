Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Signal Processing (cs.SD), Computation and Language (cs.CL), and Sound (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper extensively investigates a combination of techniques to improve ASR accuracy, which could also fall under the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Audio and Speech Processing (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
