The paper discusses nearest neighbors, decision trees, and random forests, which are all topics that fall under the umbrella of machine learning and data science. The paper also provides a general defense method and a novel attack that can be applied to a wide range of non-parametric classifiers, which suggests that the paper could be relevant to the fields of artificial intelligence and computer vision. Finally, the paper provides a strong and broadly-applicable baseline for future work on robust non-parametrics, which could be of interest to researchers in the field of computer security. Overall, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG, cs.CR, cs.CV, cs.AI, and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
