The library also utilizes deep learning methods for semantic labeling, which falls under the categories of machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, the paper mentions mesh reconstruction, which could fall under computer graphics (GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
