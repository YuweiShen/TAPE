This is a classic problem in dynamical systems theory, which is closely related to the study of algorithms and data structures. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the effect of Gaussian noise on the computation of the ergodic measure, which is a problem that is closely related to information theory. Specifically, the paper considers the tradeoff between the precision of the approximation and the amount of space required to compute it. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with dynamical systems, which are a central topic in systems and control theory. The problem of computing the ergodic measure is closely related to the study of stability and control of dynamical systems. \n4. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper discusses the approximation of the ergodic measure, which is a problem that is closely related to numerical analysis. Specifically, the paper considers the tradeoff between the precision of the approximation and the amount of space required to compute it. \n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the space complexity of computing the ergodic measure, which is a classic problem in computational complexity theory. The paper also proves a result of independent interest"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
