This involves computer vision (CV) techniques for image processing and deep learning (DL) for feature extraction. The paper also mentions the use of text recognition, which falls under the category of information retrieval (IR). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of YOLO, which is a popular object detection algorithm used in multimedia (MM) applications. Finally, the paper mentions the use of publicly available comic datasets, which could fall under the category of computational linguistics (CL) for language processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
