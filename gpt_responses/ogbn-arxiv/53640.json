The proposed algorithm involves smoothing and stylization steps, which are common in multimedia (MM) and artificial intelligence (AI) research. The paper also mentions that the algorithm is faster than existing approaches, which suggests that machine learning (LG) techniques may have been used to optimize the algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
