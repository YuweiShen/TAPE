The use of virtual machines and cluster computing also suggests a focus on distributed computing (cs.DC) and database systems (cs.DB). Finally, the use of unsupervised ingestion processes and big data analytics implies a potential interest in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
