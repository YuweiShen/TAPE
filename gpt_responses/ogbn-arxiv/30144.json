This involves using RNNs to extract causal state representations from the joint history of actions and observations. The paper also evaluates the proposed algorithm on multiple navigation tasks with both discrete and continuous observation processes. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY) due to the focus on intelligent agents and partially-observable environments. Additionally, the use of RNNs for learning state representations suggests a connection to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
