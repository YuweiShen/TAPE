The use of raw camera data for navigation suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as another likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of probabilistic modeling and variational networks, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the integration of the algorithms onboard a full-scale autonomous vehicle suggests the involvement of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
