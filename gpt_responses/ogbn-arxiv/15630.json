This involves techniques from compressive sensing, sparse Fourier transform, and complex analysis, which are commonly studied in the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also uses chaining arguments, which are commonly used in the Data Structures (cs.DS) sub-category. The problem of learning low-degree polynomials in the presence of outlier noise has been studied in the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category, and this paper builds on those results. Finally, the paper also considers the problem of adversarial outlier noise, which is a common topic in the Security and Privacy (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
