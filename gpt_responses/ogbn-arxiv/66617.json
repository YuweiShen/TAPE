Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also discusses the rate-distortion performance and the view switching delay of different coding prediction structures, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and graphics (cs.GR). The joint coding technologies for MVV and depth maps are related to computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper summarizes the bit allocation work of 3D video coding, which is related to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
