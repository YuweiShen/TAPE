Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes novel techniques to use motion information in compressed videos, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper mentions that the compressed video representation has a higher information density and the training is easier, which suggests that it could be related to machine learning and deep learning, hence cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
