The system also uses optimization techniques and machine learning algorithms to handle traffic rules and obstacle decisions, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) research. The system also considers safety and scalability, which are important in systems and control (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
