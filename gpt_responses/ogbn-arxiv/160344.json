The proposed technique involves computing the distribution of lengths of minimal windows using the independence model, which is a statistical model commonly used in information retrieval and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DB (database systems), cs.IR (information retrieval), and cs.LG (machine learning). Additionally, the paper involves computational techniques and algorithms, which are common in the sub-categories cs.DS (data structures and algorithms) and cs.AI (artificial intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
