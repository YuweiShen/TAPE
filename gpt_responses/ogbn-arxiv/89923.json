This involves managing distributed-memory parallelism and sparsity for NumPy-style operations on multidimensional arrays, as well as introducing a new multi-tensor routine that is asymptotically more efficient than pairwise tensor contraction. These topics are relevant to several sub-categories, including Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), and Scientific Computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
