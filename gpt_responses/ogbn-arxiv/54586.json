This involves the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to interpret the signals. Therefore, cs.AI and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of neural networks (NE) and signal processing (SI) techniques. Additionally, the paper discusses the application of the framework to a specific problem, QRS detection on ECG signals, which falls under the sub-category of computer engineering (CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
