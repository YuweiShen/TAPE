This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with video conferencing, which is a multimedia application. The authors also discuss video transcoding and buffering mechanisms, which are multimedia-related concepts. \n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The use of cloud-assisted communication involves distributed computing, which falls under the domain of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a decentralized, optimal algorithm for stream distribution and surrogate selection. This involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms, which falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a system (vSkyConf) for cloud-assisted mobile video conferencing. The authors also discuss the design of a buffering mechanism on each surrogate to cooperate with optimal stream distribution. This falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
