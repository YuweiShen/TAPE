The use of convolutional neural networks and multiple instance learning also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The application of the method to the UCF-Sports dataset indicates a focus on multimedia (cs.MM), while the use of unsupervised segmentation and set splitting for regularization suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
