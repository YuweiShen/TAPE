The use of evolutionary algorithms for neural architecture search falls under the umbrella of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the optimization of multiple objectives, which is a common problem in optimization and control theory (cs.SY) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
