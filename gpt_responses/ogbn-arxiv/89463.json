The paper focuses on the challenges of working with decentralized, non-identically independently distributed (non-IID), and privacy-sensitive EMRs. The algorithm clusters the distributed data into clinically meaningful communities that capture similar diagnoses and geographical locations, and learns one model for each community. This paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This paper is primarily about developing a machine learning algorithm for predicting disease incidence and patient response to treatment using EMRs.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): This paper also addresses the challenges of working with privacy-sensitive EMRs, which is a topic related to the social and ethical implications of computing.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This paper uses machine learning to develop predictive models for healthcare events, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): This paper also addresses the challenges of working with privacy-sensitive EMRs, which is a topic related to cryptography and security.\n- cs.DB (Databases): This paper also deals with the challenges of working with decentralized and non-IID data, which is a topic related to databases."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
