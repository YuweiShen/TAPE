The concept of sparsest and balanced generator matrices is related to computational complexity (cs.CC) and combinatorics (cs.DS). The paper also involves some numerical analysis (cs.NA) in the form of bounds on the size of the finite field. Finally, the topic of coding theory is often relevant to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
