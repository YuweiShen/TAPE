The paper uses Bayesian optimization to derive optimal supply-side MoD parameters and estimates a mode choice model using stated preference data. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper considers the impact of MoD services on the urban transportation system and discusses a policy intervention where the government imposes a tax on the ride-hailing service. This topic is related to the social and ethical aspects of computing, which is covered by the cs.CY sub-category. \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses Bayesian optimization to derive optimal supply-side MoD parameters and estimates a mode choice model using stated preference data. These are machine learning techniques, which are covered by the cs.LG sub-category. \n\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper considers a multimodal transportation system where travel demand is served by public transit and MoD services of varying passenger capacities. This system can be seen as a social and information network, where different modes of transportation are connected and interact with each other. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the cs.SI sub-category. \n\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a framework"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
