The paper also involves Boolean functions, finite field incidence geometry, additive combinatorics, and hypergraph (non)expanders, which are all related to computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
