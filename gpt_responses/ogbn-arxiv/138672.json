This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of multi-label learning and optimal temporal fusing, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and LSTM-based temporal fusing also suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
