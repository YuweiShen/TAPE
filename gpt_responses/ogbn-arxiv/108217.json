Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the implementation cost reduction, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). The proposed scheme involves both RF and digital processing, which can be categorized under systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also examines the performance of the proposed scheme in millimeter-wave channels, which is a topic of interest in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper presents simulation results, which can be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
