The paper proposes a system called Sitatapatra that diversifies neural networks using a key, which is a technique commonly used in cryptography (cs.CR). The system is designed to detect attacks on CNNs, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions that the system has minimal run-time overheads, which suggests that it could be used on constrained systems, such as embedded systems or Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
