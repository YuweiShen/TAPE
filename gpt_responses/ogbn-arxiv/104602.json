It may also belong to the Performance (cs.PF) sub-category as it evaluates the performance of the implementation with several low-level kernels. Additionally, it may belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category as it discusses the use of one-sided communication of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) version 3 as the underlying communication substrate. It may also belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category as it discusses the simplification of developing parallel applications. Finally, it may belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category as it presents a runtime environment for implementing the PGAS paradigm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
