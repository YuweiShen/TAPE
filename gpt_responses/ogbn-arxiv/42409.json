The use of categorical edge labels and the focus on higher-order interactions suggest that the paper may belong to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI). The use of combinatorial optimization and linear programming relaxations suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of approximation algorithms suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-category of numerical analysis (cs.SD). Finally, the use of exploratory data analysis suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
