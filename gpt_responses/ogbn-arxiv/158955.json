The most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper deals with training deep neural networks using regularisation techniques. The next likely category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), as the paper specifically focuses on regularisation techniques for deep neural networks. The paper also mentions computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) as potential applications for the proposed regularisation method, making these categories likely as well. Finally, the paper uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the underlying optimization algorithm, which falls under the category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
