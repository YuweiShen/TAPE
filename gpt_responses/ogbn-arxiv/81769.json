The paper also discusses anonymization techniques, which are commonly used in databases (cs.DB). The paper proposes a new privacy model and two anonymization schemes, which involve machine learning algorithms (cs.LG) and perturbation techniques (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the resistance of the proposed model and methods to attacks, which involves information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
