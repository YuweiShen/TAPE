The approach proposed involves probabilistic learning, which suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of force constraints also suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the validation of the approach in experimental scenarios suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) for perception and sensing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
