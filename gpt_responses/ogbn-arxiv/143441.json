This falls under the field of robotics (cs.RO) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The paper also addresses the issue of connectivity maintenance, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY). The proposed strategies involve density functions and virtual limits, which are techniques used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
