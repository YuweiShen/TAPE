Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which covers topics related to communication and signal processing. The paper also discusses the partitioning of the antenna array into independent clusters, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). The use of feedforward architectures to minimize latency is a system-level optimization, which is covered by the category of control and systems engineering (cs.SY). The paper also deals with the performance analysis of different equalization algorithms, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
