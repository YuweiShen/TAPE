The use of lattice vector quantization and entropy constraints suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia applications (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). The optimization of the expected distortion involves tradeoffs between redundancy and distortion, which is a common theme in data compression (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
