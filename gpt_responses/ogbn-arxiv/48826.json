The paper also discusses computational and communication complexity measures, which are relevant to theoretical computer science (cs.CC). The presence of adversarial errors and the use of randomness suggest that the paper may also belong to the cryptography (cs.CR) sub-category. The paper's exploration of list-decodable interactive communications and its consideration of unbounded communication and computation may also place it in the data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-categories, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
