This involves using convolutional features to suppress background interference and enhance local details, which are key techniques in computer vision (cs.CV). The attention mechanism is learned automatically, which suggests the use of machine learning algorithms (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of a hierarchical inception module to efficiently aggregate multi-scale features, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.LG). The text detector is evaluated on the ICDAR 2015 benchmark, which is a standard dataset for text detection and recognition (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the text detector, including optical character recognition and natural language processing, which are relevant to computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
