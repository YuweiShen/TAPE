The paper proposes an extension of the Morse matching algorithm for multidimensional filtrations, which involves the use of discrete structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also presents experiments with filtrations of triangular meshes, which involves the use of computational geometry techniques (cs.CG) and algorithms for handling large datasets (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
