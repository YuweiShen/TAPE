The use of families of vectors and the investigation of different models for defining pure scoring rules suggest a focus on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the study of the descriptive richness of different models and the proof of some restrictions losing generality suggest a focus on discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
