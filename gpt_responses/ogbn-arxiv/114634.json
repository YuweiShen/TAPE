This falls under the scope of numerical analysis. \n2. cs.EM (Electromagnetism): The paper deals with the fabrication of optical devices and the propagation of uncertainties in material and geometry to the scattering parameters of the system. This falls under the scope of electromagnetism. \n3. cs.Optics (Optics): The paper deals with the fabrication of optical devices and the use of an optical grating coupler as a benchmark example. This falls under the scope of optics. \n4. cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper discusses the use of a dimension-adaptive scheme based on weighted Leja nodes and the use of either standard global polynomials or conformally mapped polynomials for surrogate modeling. This falls under the scope of mathematical software. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This category is unlikely as the paper does not deal with social or information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
