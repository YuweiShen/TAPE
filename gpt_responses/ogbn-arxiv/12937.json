This suggests a focus on information theory and communication systems. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of RISs for future wireless networks and proposes a resource allocation algorithm that considers user scheduling and power control. This suggests a focus on networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper designs a passive beamformer that can achieve optimal performance by controlling the incident wave properties, which involves system and control design. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of RISs for increasing the achievable system sum-rate, which could involve multimedia applications that require high data rates. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes practical solutions for RISs with associated limitations, which could involve computational engineering and science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
