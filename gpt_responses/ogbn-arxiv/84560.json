The proposed method involves multitask learning using CNNs, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions benchmark datasets for metric learning, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM). The paper involves capturing visual similarity, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR).
