Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a system that combines textual and deep-learning based methods, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the presence of noise in the data, which requires robust feature extraction techniques, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a likely sub-category. Finally, the proposed system uses neural networks, which falls under the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
