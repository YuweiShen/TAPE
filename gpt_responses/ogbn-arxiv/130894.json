The use of Kriging as a surrogate model and Bayesian optimization suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The comparison of infill criteria for decision-making in optimization algorithms suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the investigation of the impact of problem dimensionality on algorithm performance suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
