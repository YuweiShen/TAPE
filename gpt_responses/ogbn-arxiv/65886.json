The paper focuses on vision-based instruction following, which suggests that it could belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) or robotics (cs.RO) subcategories. However, the main contribution of the paper is the use of inverse reinforcement learning to ground language commands as reward functions, which suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) subcategories. Finally, the paper proposes a deep neural network architecture for representing the reward function, which suggests that it could also belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) subcategory. Therefore, the most likely subcategories are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.RO, and cs.CL, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
