The proposed experimental framework involves generating systematic distortions on segmentation, which is a technique commonly used in deep learning (DL) and machine learning (LG) for data augmentation. The paper also evaluates several established and state-of-the-art methods, which is a common practice in natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics (CL).
