This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS). The problem also involves optimizing user inconvenience, which can be seen as a social impact (cs.SI) aspect. The proposed heuristics involve machine learning techniques, which can be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG).
