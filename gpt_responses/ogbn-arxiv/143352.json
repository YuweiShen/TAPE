It could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as it proposes a new method for hashing and comparing data. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as it deals with similarity measures for files. It may also fall under cs.SE (Software Engineering) as it discusses the development of a high-performance implementation of the method.
