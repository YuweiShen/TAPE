It may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as it proposes a novel training strategy and model compression method. Additionally, it may be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as face detection is often used in multimedia applications. Finally, it may also be relevant to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category as face detection is used in security applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
