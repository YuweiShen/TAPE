This involves developing methods for constrained optimization and multi-headed model structures. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves experiments using a 3D simulator, which suggests relevance to cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the experiments involve image data, which suggests relevance to cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
