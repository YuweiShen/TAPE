The paper also proposes algorithms and heuristics to solve the problem, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also discusses characteristics of sequences that can indicate the difficulty of realizing them, which is related to computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
