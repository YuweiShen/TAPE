This falls under the broader category of computers and society.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper uses crowd-sourced points of interest (POIs) to infer urban parcels, which involves analyzing social networks and information flows.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper uses various data sources, including OpenStreetMap, housing-related online check-in records, and census data, and proposes an automatic process for synthesizing population attributes. This involves database management and data integration.\n- cs.SD (Software Development): The paper proposes a new tool called Agenter for synthesizing population attributes, which involves software development.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although not a major focus of the paper, there may be some security and privacy implications related to the use of housing-related online check-in records and census data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
