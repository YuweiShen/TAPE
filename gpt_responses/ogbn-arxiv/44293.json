The use of a fully-convolutional network and residual learning techniques suggests a focus on machine learning (LG) and multimedia (MM) subfields. Additionally, the joint training of the measurement and reconstruction stages implies a potential application of neural networks (NE) in optimization problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
