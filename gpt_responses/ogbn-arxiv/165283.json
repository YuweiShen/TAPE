Specifically, the paper focuses on techniques for transferring knowledge from a complex model (teacher) to a smaller model (student), which is a common problem in deep learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
