The paper also discusses the use of convolutional neural networks and loss functions, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of attention modules, which are commonly used in multimedia processing (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses training tricks for face recognition, which could fall under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
