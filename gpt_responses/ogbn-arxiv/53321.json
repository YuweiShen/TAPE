This suggests a connection to logic in computer science.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper deals with concurrent programs, which are a central topic in programming languages research. Additionally, the paper discusses synthesis and model-checking of correctness properties, which are also common topics in programming languages.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents an algorithm for transforming concurrent programs into pairwise normal form, which involves manipulating the structure of the program. This suggests a connection to data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper deals with correctness properties of concurrent programs, which is a central concern in software engineering. Additionally, the paper discusses synthesis of programs, which is also a topic in software engineering.\n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper deals with finite-state concurrent programs, which can be modeled as finite automata. Additionally, the paper discusses bisimilarity, which is a concept from automata theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
