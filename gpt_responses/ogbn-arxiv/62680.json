The use of an on-board camera and the emphasis on visual cues suggest that computer vision (cs.CV) is also a likely sub-category. The notion of anticipation and the use of a simplified model for forward-simulation of robot dynamics suggest that control systems (cs.SY) is another possible sub-category. The approach being task-driven and efficient suggests that machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
