The use of feedback in communication systems is also a topic of interest in networking (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the achievable error probability and error exponent, which are important metrics in signal processing (cs.SY) and multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
