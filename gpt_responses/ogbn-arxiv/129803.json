This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SP) domains. The paper specifically focuses on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, which falls under the sub-category of cs.MM (multiple dimensions). The use of nested lattice based coding and filter design also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the sub-categories of cs.NI (networking and internet architecture) and cs.CC (computational complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
