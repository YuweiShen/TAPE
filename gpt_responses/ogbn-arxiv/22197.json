The paper discusses algorithms for finding a set of seed nodes that maximize influence spread on a social network, which is a problem in social network analysis (cs.SOC). The paper also discusses the use of heuristics and optimization techniques, which are common in machine learning (cs.AI) and data science (cs.DS). The paper also presents a novel iterative ranking framework for solving the influence maximization problem, which involves ranking nodes based on their influence spread, a topic that falls under the category of learning to rank (cs.LG). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on large-scale real-world social networks, which is a common topic in social network analysis (cs.SOC) and data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
