The use of Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (TCN) and the focus on interpretability suggest that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of 3D skeletons as input data suggests that the paper may be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
