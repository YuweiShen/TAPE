The paper specifically focuses on Transfer Learning (TL) methods for RUL prediction, which involves transferring knowledge learned in one setting (the source domain) to another setting (the target domain). TL is a popular topic in machine learning and is often studied in the context of various subfields such as deep learning, artificial intelligence, systems and control, and software engineering. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
