It also establishes connections between this problem and tensor decomposition, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper uses mathematical analysis and proofs, which are common in the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper provides numerical evidence, which is a common approach in the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
