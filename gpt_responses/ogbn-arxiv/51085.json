This falls under the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the use of similarity comparison and hierarchical clustering methods involves machine learning techniques, which could also place this paper under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) in terms of constructing corpora and analyzing word frequencies. Finally, the use of word vectors and clustering methods could also fall under the sub-category of deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
