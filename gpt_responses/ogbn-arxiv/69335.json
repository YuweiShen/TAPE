The proposed model, MTLVM, is a sequential latent variable model designed for capturing the sequential dependencies of corporate recruitment states and is able to automatically learn the latent recruitment topics within a Bayesian generative framework. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with the analysis of recruitment data, which is a type of information that needs to be retrieved and processed. The proposed model, MTLVM, is designed to automatically discover recruitment market trends based on large-scale recruitment data. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with the analysis of recruitment data, which is a type of social network data. The proposed model, MTLVM, is designed to capture the variability of recruitment topics over time, which is a characteristic of social networks. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with the analysis of recruitment data, which is a type of language data.
