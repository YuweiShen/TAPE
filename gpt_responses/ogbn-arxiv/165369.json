The paper also discusses transfer learning, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of meta-parameters and their impact on performance is also discussed, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of scarce training data, which is a common issue in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
