The problem involves assignment restrictions, which can be modeled as constraints, making it relevant to the constraint satisfaction (cs.CC) sub-category. The paper also discusses approximation algorithms, which are commonly studied in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the problem involves optimization, which can be studied in the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-category.
