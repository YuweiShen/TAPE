However, the focus on distributed computing and graph theory makes cs.DC and cs.DS the most likely categories. The paper also discusses algorithms and open problems, which could place it in cs.CC and cs.LG. Finally, the concept of local certification is related to graph properties, which could make cs.GT a relevant category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
