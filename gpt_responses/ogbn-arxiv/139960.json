The proposed blind detection scheme involves estimating the channel and data by factorizing the received signal matrix, which is a technique commonly used in networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper specifically focuses on the sparsity of the massive MIMO channel, which is a characteristic of the channel that is often studied in the context of massive MIMO (cs.MM). Finally, the paper presents numerical results that demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
