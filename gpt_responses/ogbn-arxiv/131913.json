The paper also mentions the use of nonparametric structures and linear time and space complexities, which are common topics in the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
