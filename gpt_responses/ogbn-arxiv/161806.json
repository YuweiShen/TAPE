Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also extensively uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for representing target appearances, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with multi-modality in target appearances and model reliability, which could also make it relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
