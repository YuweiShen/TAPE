The proposed approach uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and control signal estimation from an image, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The end-to-end framework for feature extraction and control signal estimation is a form of deep learning (cs.AI). Finally, the task of autonomous corridor following is a form of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
