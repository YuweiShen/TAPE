Specifically, the paper compares the use of ReLU and sigmoidal activation functions in these networks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses generalization performance and learning curves, which are topics related to machine learning and statistical learning theory, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. The use of neural networks in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) is also mentioned in the paper, making these sub-categories likely as well. Finally, the paper discusses the behavior of hidden units in neural networks, which falls under the category of signal processing and information theory, making cs.SI (Signal Processing) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
