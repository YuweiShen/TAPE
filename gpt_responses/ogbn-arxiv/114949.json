The paper focuses on improving the performance of the FL framework by introducing domain- and client-specific criteria and a priority-aware aggregation operator used in the field of information retrieval. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) since the paper addresses the issue of data security and privacy. The paper also proposes a mechanism for online-adjustment of the aggregation operator parameters, which falls under the category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach to FL, which can be considered as a contribution to the field of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
