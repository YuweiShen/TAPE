This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The use of LiDAR also involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques for processing the 3D data. The joint optimization of LiDAR odometry and IMU measurements involves optimization algorithms and techniques, which fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of sensors for location estimation is a key aspect of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
