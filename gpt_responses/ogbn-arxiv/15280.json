Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the study of communication systems and their theoretical foundations. The paper also discusses the performance and power efficiency of the beamforming architectures, which falls under the scope of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of beam alignment schemes and MU-MIMO precoding schemes also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
