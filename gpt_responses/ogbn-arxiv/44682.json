The use of perturbation and the derivation of lower bounds suggest that the paper may also fall under the category of data structures (cs.DS) and graph theory (cs.GT). The mention of explicit lower bounds on primitive vectors may also indicate a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the use of convexity and the study of faces suggest that the paper may also be relevant to computational topology (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
