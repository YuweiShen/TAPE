This falls under the purview of information theory, which deals with the fundamental limits of communication and information processing. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper employs deep neural networks (DNNs) for modulation detection and proposes a defense mechanism against DNN-based intruders. This falls under the domain of machine learning, which deals with the development of algorithms and models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper proposes a defense mechanism against intruders in wireless communication, which is a key area of research in cryptography and security. The paper also discusses the limitations of existing defense mechanisms and proposes a new approach based on adversarial perturbation. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper employs DNNs for modulation detection and proposes a defense mechanism based on adversarial perturbation, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. Adversarial perturbation is a technique used to fool or evade machine learning models, and has been extensively studied in the AI community. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with wireless communication and proposes a defense mechanism against intr"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
