This falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper proposes an event-triggered approach to reduce computational load, which could fall under the categories of computer engineering (cs.CE) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of simulation results to validate the proposed approach could also fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) or signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
