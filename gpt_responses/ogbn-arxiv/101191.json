This topic falls under the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) information and the Equal Gain Combiner (EGC) receiver, which are relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories.
