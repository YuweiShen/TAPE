The use of coherence spaces and normal functors also suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL) and category theory (cs.CC). The discussion of cardinality and complexity bounds further supports the relevance to data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
