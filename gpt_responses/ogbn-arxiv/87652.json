The paper also focuses on the specific problem of model extraction, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The attacks are based on exploiting the features of different model classes, which suggests a focus on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper highlights the need for careful model deployment, which is a concern in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
