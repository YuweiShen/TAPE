The use of deep learning models for feature learning also suggests that the paper could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The problem being addressed is related to security and authentication, which could fall under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. The paper also discusses experiments conducted on different datasets, which could suggest that it belongs to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the use of a novel formulation of the problem that includes knowledge of skilled forgeries could suggest that the paper belongs to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
