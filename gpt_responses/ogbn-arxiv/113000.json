The approach involves synthesizing controllers using control funnel functions, which are mathematical functions that encode the control law and its correctness argument over a mathematical model of the vehicle dynamics. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY). The use of a demonstration-based learning algorithm to synthesize the control funnel function suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The implementation of the approach on a physical vehicle suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
