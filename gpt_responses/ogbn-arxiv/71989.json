This involves feature extraction using path signature and feature map distortion and model averaging using spatial stochastic max-pooling. These techniques are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. The paper also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) in the context of recognizing handwritten Chinese characters. Finally, the use of deep neural networks for recognition falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
