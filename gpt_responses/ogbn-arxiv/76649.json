It introduces the notion of teleo-reactive (T-R) programs, which are used for the continuous computation of the parameters and conditions on which agent action is based. This paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents a formalism for computing and organizing actions for autonomous agents, which is a core topic in AI. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper describes experimental applications of T-R programs in the control of simulated and actual mobile robots, which falls under the scope of robotics. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the construction of circuitry for the continuous computation of the parameters and conditions on which agent action is based, which is related to systems and control. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper introduces a new formalism for writing programs for autonomous agents, which is relevant to software engineering. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions that T-R programs are written in a form that is compatible with automatic planning and learning methods, which is related to machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
