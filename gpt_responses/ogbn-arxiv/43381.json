Additionally, the paper involves learning an embedding to encourage pairs of analogous images to be close together, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper also involves natural language processing, as it introduces a dataset of visual analogy questions in natural images (cs.CL). Finally, the paper involves information retrieval, as it involves searching for the image D that satisfies the analogy relation (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
