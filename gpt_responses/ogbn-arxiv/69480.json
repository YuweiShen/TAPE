The paper focuses on Persian text summarization, which falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP). Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses word embeddings, which are commonly used in information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML), suggesting cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses clustering and ranking algorithms, which are also common in AI (Artificial Intelligence) and NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), making them likely sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
