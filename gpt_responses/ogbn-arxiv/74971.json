The method involves using a state-of-the-art Deep CNN-based detector to find hands and faces in RGB images, then examining the corresponding depth channel pixels to obtain full 3D pointing vectors. The system runs at better than 30Hz on commodity hardware, and an estimate of the absolute pointing accuracy is found empirically by comparison with ground-truth data from a VICON motion-capture system. The paper also provides source code as a ROS node, with the intention of contributing a commodity implementation of this common component in HRI systems. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.RO (Robotics), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). Additionally, the paper involves the use of a Deep CNN-based detector, which suggests a possible fit with cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
