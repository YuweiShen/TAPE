The paper also makes use of graph theory concepts, such as cages and trapping sets, which are relevant to computer science (cs.CC) and network science (cs.NI). Finally, the paper's focus on deriving upper bounds on the minimum distance of LDPC codes suggests a potential application in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
