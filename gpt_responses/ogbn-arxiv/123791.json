The paper proposes a new syntax for multi-relational patterns and introduces an efficient algorithm to mine such patterns. The paper also discusses a method for quantifying the interestingness of the patterns. Based on these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.DB (Databases), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
