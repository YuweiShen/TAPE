This falls under the scope of embedded systems research.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the use of OpenMP accelerator programming for the manycore accelerators on the HERO platform, which falls under the scope of parallel computing research.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the software stack that accompanies the HERO platform, including a cross-compilation toolchain, Linux driver, and runtime libraries.
