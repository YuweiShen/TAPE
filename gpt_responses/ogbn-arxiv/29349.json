The paper also discusses the use of EM algorithm and MPE inference, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with conditional independencies, which is a topic in probability theory and statistics (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the interpretation of SPNs as Bayesian networks, which is a topic in natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV).
