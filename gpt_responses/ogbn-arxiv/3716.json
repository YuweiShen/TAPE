This makes it relevant to cs.AR, which deals with hardware architecture, and cs.ET, which deals with embedded systems. The use of CNNs for computer vision applications makes it relevant to cs.CV. The focus on sparsity and reduced precision for training and inference makes it relevant to cs.NE. Finally, the use of efficient memory interfaces and algorithms for CNN evaluation makes it relevant to cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
