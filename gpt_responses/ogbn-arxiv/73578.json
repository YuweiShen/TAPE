The use of probabilistic bisection algorithm and active query design also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.AI) and optimization (cs.LG). The comparison with the traditional sliding window technique indicates a potential interest in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
