The use of entropy-regularized optimal transport (EOT) cost is a novel approach that falls under the category of optimization (cs.IT) and could also be considered a form of regularization in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of adversarial training, which is a popular technique in generative models (cs.AI, cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
