The paper also discusses the use of minimum variance unbiased (MVU) estimator, which is a common concept in mathematical statistics (cs.MA) and machine learning (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper provides simulations to validate the proposed estimator, which falls under the category of modeling and simulation (cs.MS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
