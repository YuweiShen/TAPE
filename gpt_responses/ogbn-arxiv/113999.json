The paper focuses on the computational complexity of building the tree and proposes an alternative algorithm that uses presorting to avoid the need for further sorting during tree construction. This topic is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), computational geometry (cs.CG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
