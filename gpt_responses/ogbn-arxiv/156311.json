It also considers the impact of inter-cell interference, which is a topic of interest in the networked systems (cs.NI) and control theory (cs.SY) communities. The paper also discusses the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) region, which is a concept commonly used in the field of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the design of a cooperative multi-cell system, which is relevant to the field of communication networks (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
