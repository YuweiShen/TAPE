The paper also discusses the performance of composed programs, which could fall under software engineering (cs.SE) or logic in computer science (cs.LO). The use of meta-tracing for JIT compilation could also fall under artificial intelligence and machine learning (cs.PL.AI). Finally, the implementation of the composition using different approaches could fall under distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
