This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes a novel approach for age estimation using evolutionary mechanisms, which can be considered as a subfield of artificial intelligence. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - Age estimation is a common task in multimedia analysis, and the paper proposes a new method for this task. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) - The paper proposes an evolutionary network for age estimation, which involves two concurrent evolutionary processes.
