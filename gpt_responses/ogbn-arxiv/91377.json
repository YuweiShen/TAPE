Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also discusses the randomness and independence of hash functions, which are topics in information theory (cs.IT) and databases (cs.DB). The paper proposes a new construction for hash functions, which involves analyzing the degree of independence, a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
