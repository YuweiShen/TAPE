This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the use of medical data and patient history suggests a potential fit for computational biology (cs.CE). Finally, the use of multiple modalities (radiographic and clinical data) could also suggest a fit for multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
