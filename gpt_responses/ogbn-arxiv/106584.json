This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of video data also suggests the possibility of multimedia (cs.MM) being a relevant sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of injuries on fan interest, which could be related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
