It may also fall under numerical analysis (cs.NA) as it suggests a change in the current gradient descent methods to improve their stability and speed. Additionally, the paper mentions testing the new method on computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) tasks, indicating that it may be relevant to these sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper proposes a new take on the ADAM algorithm, which is commonly used in control systems (cs.SY), suggesting that it may also be relevant to this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
