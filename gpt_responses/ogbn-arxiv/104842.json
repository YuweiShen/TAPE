The paper also discusses the recent improvements in local descriptors obtained by learning them from large annotated datasets, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses tasks such as matching, retrieval, and classification, which are common in information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of several state-of-the-art descriptors and analyses their properties, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
