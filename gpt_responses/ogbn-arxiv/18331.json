Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper uses deep learning models, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with feature representations, which could place it in cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper uses benchmark datasets and discusses image-based question answering, which could suggest a connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
