The use of measure concentration techniques is a common tool in information theory (cs.IT) and is mentioned in the abstract as a key component of the analysis. The paper also discusses machine learning tasks, which is a topic in the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The analysis of the space complexity of the streaming algorithms involves probabilistic arguments, which is a topic in the subfield of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper deals with approximation algorithms, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
