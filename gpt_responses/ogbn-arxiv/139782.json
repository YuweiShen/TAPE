It also discusses the use of various resources such as randomness, common randomness, and correlation, which are relevant to cryptography (cs.CR) and coding theory (cs.CC). The concept of super-activation is related to multi-user information theory (cs.MM), and the analysis of different types of resources can also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
