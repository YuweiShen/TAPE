The paper also focuses on clock synchronization and consensus problems, which are fundamental topics in the Distributed Systems (cs.DS) sub-category. The use of self-stabilizing algorithms is another key aspect of the paper, which falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also deals with communication complexity, which is a topic in the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category.
