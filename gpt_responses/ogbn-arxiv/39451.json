The use of a large dataset of Twitter users also suggests that it may fall under the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) and Social and Economic Networks (cs.SOC) sub-categories. The analysis of the data using a parametric Hawkes process model suggests that it may also belong to the Statistical Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the study of language change as a complex social phenomenon may also place it under the Social and Behavioral Sciences (cs.SD) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
