This involves reasoning about the behavior of programs, which is a logical task. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper deals with monads, which are a fundamental concept in functional programming languages. Moreover, the paper proposes a language inspired by Moggi's monadic metalanguage, which is a programming language for defining monads. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a framework for verifying programs, which is a key task in software engineering. The framework is implemented in Coq and F*, which are software tools for formal verification. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper deals with monads, which are a mathematical concept that is closely related to formal languages and automata theory. \n- cs.FM (Formal Methods): The paper proposes a formal framework for verifying programs, which is a key task in formal methods. The framework is implemented in Coq and F*, which are formal methods tools."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
