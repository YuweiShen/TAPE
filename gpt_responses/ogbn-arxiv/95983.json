Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. Additionally, since the paper focuses on the optimization of deep neural networks, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a likely sub-category.
