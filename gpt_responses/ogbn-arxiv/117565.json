The use of activation functions is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) applications. Additionally, the paper mentions the potential for provable robustness, which is a topic often discussed in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
