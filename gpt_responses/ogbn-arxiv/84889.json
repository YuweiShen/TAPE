This makes it relevant to the networking and internet architecture community. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with information flow in a network with multiple sources and sinks, which is a topic of interest in social and information networks. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper provides capacity-achieving code constructions with polynomial or exponential complexity, which involves algorithmic techniques and data structures. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper considers an adversarial model where edge adversaries can corrupt packets, which is a security concern in network communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
