The paper also proposes online algorithms for dynamic provisioning, which involves decision-making under uncertainty and optimization (cs.SY, cs.PF). The algorithms are based on mathematical models and analysis, which suggests a connection to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG, cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
