The authors propose a novel clustering and outlier detection method, which involves organizing data and eliminating irrelevant instances, which is a common task in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the use of weakly-labelled datasets, which is a common task in information retrieval (cs.IR). The proposed method is capable of working at large scale with no supervision, which is a common task in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves the use of natural language queries to retrieve images, which is a common task in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
