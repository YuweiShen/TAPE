The method is specifically designed for noisy signals, which could also fall under the category of signal processing (cs.SP) or biomedical engineering (cs.BE). The paper also mentions the use of wavelet transform and template matching, which are common techniques in computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SP). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for automatic ECG analysis, which could fall under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
