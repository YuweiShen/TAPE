The paper uses qualitative interviews and large-scale log analysis to understand the factors that influence email deferral. The study also discusses deferral strategies and trains a classifier for predicting email deferral. Given the focus on user behavior and decision-making, the most likely sub-category is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). Information Retrieval (cs.IR) is also likely as the paper analyzes email logs to understand user behavior. Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) and Cybersecurity (cs.CY) are possible sub-categories as the paper discusses strategies for marking and flagging emails. Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) is also a possible sub-category as the paper analyzes large-scale email logs to understand user behavior."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
