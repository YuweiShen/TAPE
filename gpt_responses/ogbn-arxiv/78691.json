This involves modeling complex interactions between agents and encoding long-term intent. The paper also presents a specific application of the framework to basketball gameplay. Based on these aspects, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (artificial intelligence), cs.LG (machine learning), cs.RO (robotics), cs.SY (systems and control), and cs.CV (computer vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
