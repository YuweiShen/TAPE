The proposed architecture introduces competition amongst layers, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to improve performance. The paper also mentions the use of specialized sub-networks, which is a concept commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
