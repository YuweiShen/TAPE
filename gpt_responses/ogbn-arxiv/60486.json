This involves AI techniques such as finding equilibria and optimizing group performance. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the efficiency of different reward mechanisms and equilibria in terms of group performance, which involves analyzing the complexity of algorithms and data structures used in the game. \n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper uses mathematical tools such as probability theory and combinatorics to analyze the search game and derive results. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper studies a cooperative search game with multiple players, which can be seen as a social network where players interact and share information. The proposed reward mechanism and equilibrium can be seen as a way to optimize information sharing and cooperation in such networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
