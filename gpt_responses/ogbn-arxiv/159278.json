It discusses the use of convex programming to solve this problem and extends the method to blind super-resolution. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SP (Signal Processing), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
