Therefore, it is highly likely that this paper would be categorized under cs.GT.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the computational complexity of solving reachability switching games, which involves designing algorithms and data structures. Therefore, it is likely that this paper would be categorized under cs.DS.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses the structure of winning strategies in reachability switching games, which involves logical reasoning. Therefore, it is possible that this paper would be categorized under cs.LO.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses a type of game that provides deterministic analogues of Markovian systems, which is a topic of interest in AI research. Therefore, it is possible that this paper would be categorized under cs.AI.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper analyzes the computational complexity of different variants of reachability switching games, which is a topic of interest in computational complexity theory.
