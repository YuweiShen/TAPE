The use of star-convex polyhedra as a shape representation also suggests a potential overlap with the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories due to the use of volumetric (3D) fluorescence microscopy datasets and the need to efficiently compute intersections between pairs of shapes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
