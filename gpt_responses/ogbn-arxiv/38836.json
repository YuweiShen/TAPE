This involves training a neural network to transform 3D point clouds of objects to a metric space that captures the similarity of the depicted spatial relations, using only geometric models of the objects. The approach employs gradient-based optimization to compute object poses in order to imitate an arbitrary target relation by reducing the distance to it under the learned metric. This work involves robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
