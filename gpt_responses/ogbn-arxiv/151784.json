The use of algorithms and analysis to design a defense against jamming suggests that the paper could also be classified under cryptography and security (cs.CR) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the use of resource-competitive analysis and the focus on cost suggests that the paper could also be classified under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
