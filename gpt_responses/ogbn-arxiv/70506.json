The paper proposes a new algorithm for the problem and provides new lower bounds for the special case of two arms. This makes it likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), and statistics (cs.ST)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
