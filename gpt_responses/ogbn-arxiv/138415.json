The paper also discusses the use of deep learning-based denoisers, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The convergence analysis of the Plug-and-Play framework involves optimization techniques such as ADMM and FBS, which are commonly used in optimization and signal processing (cs.NA). Finally, the paper proposes a technique for training deep learning-based denoisers, which involves the use of Lipschitz constants, a concept from information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
