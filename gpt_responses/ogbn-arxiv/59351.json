The paper specifically focuses on learning dilation parameters adaptively per channel, which is a technique used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for semantic segmentation. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of hand-tuned dilation parameters in current state-of-the-art methods, which suggests that the authors are interested in improving the performance of existing techniques. This makes it likely that the paper could also be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the authors are using a learning-based approach to improve the performance of their model. \n\nAdditionally, the paper discusses the importance of contextual information for semantic segmentation, which suggests that the authors are interested in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for computer vision. This makes it likely that the paper could also be classified under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of dilated convolutions, which are a type of neural network architecture commonly used in computer vision.
