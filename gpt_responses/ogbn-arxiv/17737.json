The paper also deals with extremal problems and graph drawing problems, which are related to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.GT). The study of nearly-planar graphs also involves the analysis of graph density, which is a topic in computational and discrete mathematics (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the readability of graph drawings, which is a topic in human-computer interaction and information visualization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
