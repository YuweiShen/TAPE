The focus on domain adaptation and generalization also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of self-supervised learning and auxiliary tasks is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL), and the paper's focus on visual domains suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
