This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SP). The paper also discusses the performance of the compress-and-estimate (CE) coding scheme, which involves compressing the noisy source observations to minimize local distortion, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper introduces lower and upper bounds for the performance gap, which is related to statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
