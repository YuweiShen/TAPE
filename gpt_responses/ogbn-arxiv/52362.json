The paper also mentions the relevance of these constructions in sphere packing, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Additionally, the paper discusses the minimum distance properties of the constructions, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). The mention of efficient vector quantization suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and the mention of bit interleaved coded modulation suggests a connection to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
