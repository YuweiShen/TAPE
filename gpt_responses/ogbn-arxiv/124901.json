This problem is relevant to several areas of computer science, including algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper proposes a novel technique for solving this problem using hashing and optimization, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in all of these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
