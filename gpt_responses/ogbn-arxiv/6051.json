The paper focuses on exploiting the concept of group as the basic unit of sparse representation, which is composed of nonlocal patches with similar structures. This approach is related to computer vision (cs.CV) as it deals with image restoration. It also involves information theory (cs.IT) as it deals with sparse representation modeling. The paper also proposes an effective self-adaptive dictionary learning method, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG). The split Bregman based technique used to solve the proposed GSR-driven minimization problem for image restoration is related to mathematical modeling (cs.MM) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
