The paper also leverages non-parametric Bayesian learning techniques, which is a common approach in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper uses sample-based optimization, which is a technique commonly used in Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of CAV testing facilities, which involves the integration of multiple systems and sensors, making it relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
