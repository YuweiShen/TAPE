The paper also explores the interplay between noise and curvature in deep models, which is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the Hessian matrix and covariance matrix, which are concepts from information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
