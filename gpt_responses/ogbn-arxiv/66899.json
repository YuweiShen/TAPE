The approach presented in the paper involves using decision tree learning to generate constraints on the CI configuration, which could fall under programming languages (cs.PL) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. The paper also deals with managing configurations for the build across many system environments, which could fall under systems and control (cs.SY) category. Finally, the paper uses automation to learn from heterogeneous build environments, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
