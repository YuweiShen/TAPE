This involves automated analysis of X-ray images, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of deep learning also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the proposed method has applications in robotics (cs.RO) for improving guidance during interventions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
