The paper also discusses mathematical approaches to represent motion risk, which could be related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the search and rescue community, which could be related to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for reducing robot failure in the field, which could be related to computer vision (cs.CV) for improving perception and sensing capabilities of robots."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
