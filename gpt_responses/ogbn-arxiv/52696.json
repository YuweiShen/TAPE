The paper also discusses the use of dynamic vision sensors in platforms such as drones and self-driving cars, which falls under the sub-category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper proposes a method for generating pseudo-labels for supervised learning, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of neuromorphic sensors, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
