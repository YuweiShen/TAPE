The use of spectral unmixing techniques for decomposing mixed pixels is a common problem in computer vision and image processing. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and graph regularization techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper deals with the problem of decomposing mixed pixels in hyperspectral imagery, which is a type of remote sensing data. Remote sensing data is often used in information retrieval applications such as land cover classification and environmental monitoring. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper uses a simulated annealing method for determining the sparseness parameter, which is a common optimization technique in algorithms. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper uses machine learning techniques for solving the problem of spectral unmixing in hyperspectral imagery, which is a common application of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
