The paper also discusses the use of an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework to efficiently solve for the optimal directions. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision), as the paper deals with clustering and segmentation of data, particularly in the context of face clustering. The paper also involves optimization techniques, which could place it in the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the use of neighborhood sets, which could place it in the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
