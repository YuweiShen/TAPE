The algorithm proposed is based on Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), which is a popular method in the field of compressed sensing (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of solutions to the distributed top-K problem in the database literature, which falls under the category of distributed systems (cs.SY) and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
