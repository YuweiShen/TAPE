It also involves the development of efficient algorithms and data structures for propagators, which falls under programming languages (cs.PL) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses techniques for systematic derivation of propagators, which is related to logic and verification (cs.LO) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
