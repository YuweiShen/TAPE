The paper also discusses the complexity of the problem, which is a common theme in computational complexity (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper uses techniques such as linear ordering and forbidden induced subgraphs, which are often used in algorithmic graph theory (cs.GT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
