The paper also addresses the challenges of sparsity and variability in real-world datasets, which is a common problem in information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper proposes a novel hierarchical embedding architecture, which involves modeling the visual characteristics of different product categories, making it relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
