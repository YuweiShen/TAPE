Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Communications (cs.COMM), and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a new constellation design and bit mapping scheme, which involves signal processing and optimization techniques, making it relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
