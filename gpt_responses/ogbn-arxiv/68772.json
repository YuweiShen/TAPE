This involves the use of computer vision tools to estimate these cues from video, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper is concerned with affective computing and modelling, which can be categorized under human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and machine learning (cs.CL). The use of hand-crafted and CNN-learned features also falls under the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SD) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
