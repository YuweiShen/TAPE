The paper's focus on normalization and proof theory suggests that it is likely to be classified under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) or cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper's use of phase semantics and syntactic models suggests that it may also be relevant to areas such as artificial intelligence (cs.AI), programming languages (cs.PL), and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
