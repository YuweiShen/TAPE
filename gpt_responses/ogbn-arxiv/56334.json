The paper also discusses communication bandwidth and cost, which are relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC). The experiments involve convolutional and recurrent neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.NE) tasks. Finally, the paper proposes a compression framework that can be applied to various learning tasks, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
