The use of Gaussian mixture models and probabilistic safety measures suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The evaluation of the proposed method in simulation and on a physical robot arm suggests a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
