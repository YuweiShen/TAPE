It could also belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) as it proposes a design inspired by mix-net technologies. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as it deals with Oblivious RAM, which is a data structure. It could also be categorized under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) as Oblivious RAM is known to have high overhead, which is a complexity concern. Finally, it could be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it proposes a system design for secure delegation of eviction in Oblivious RAM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
