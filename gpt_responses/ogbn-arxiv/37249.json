The use of linear programming suggests a connection to optimization and algorithms (cs.DS and cs.DC). The mention of \"nearest-neighbor certificate properties\" suggests a possible connection to computational complexity and verification (cs.SI). Finally, the use of relative minimum distances suggests a possible connection to machine learning and statistical inference (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
