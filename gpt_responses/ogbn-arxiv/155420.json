The system uses a pedestrian motion prediction model, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV) and machine learning algorithms (cs.AI). The planning algorithm also involves decision-making under uncertainty, which is a common topic in reinforcement learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
