The paper also discusses subjective evaluation of image quality, which falls under computer graphics (cs.GR). The use of objective quality metrics suggests a machine learning (cs.MM) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) approach. Finally, the paper's focus on evaluating and comparing algorithms suggests a possible overlap with machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
