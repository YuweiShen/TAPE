The paper also proposes a novel attention mechanism to model long-range relationships, which is a common technique used in computer vision. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. \n\nThe paper proposes a new method for person re-identification, which involves learning discriminative representations from semantically coherent parts. This suggests that it could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of datasets, which suggests that it could belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category. \n\nFinally, the paper proposes a new attention mechanism, which could have implications for security and cryptography.
