The paper proposes a novel multilevel algorithm to compute a graph layout with respect to a recently proposed metric that combines layout stress and entropy. This metric is used to optimize the layout of large graphs, which is a common problem in many fields, including computer science, social sciences, and biology. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.GR (Computer Graphics), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
