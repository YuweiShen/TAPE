This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a tree search scheme and a risk estimation index to guide the search for states with major contributions to the risk. These techniques are commonly used in artificial intelligence and optimization.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper does not explicitly mention the use of neural networks or evolutionary algorithms, but these techniques are commonly used in risk assessment and optimization problems.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not explicitly mention the use of machine learning, but the proposed risk estimation index and tree search scheme can be seen as machine learning techniques.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not involve social networks, but the proposed approach can be applied to information networks such as communication networks or transportation networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
