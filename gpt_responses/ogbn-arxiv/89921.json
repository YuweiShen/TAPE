The paper specifically focuses on ensemble learning methods in NAS, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) applications. The proposed method also involves pruning sub-architectures, which is a technique used in neural networks (cs.NE) and control systems (cs.SY).
