Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) since the proposed method involves deep learning and image classification. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of novel loss functions, which suggests a focus on optimization and neural networks, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a likely sub-category as well. Finally, the paper deals with data preprocessing, which could also place it in the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
