It may also fall under the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) as these fields heavily rely on machine learning techniques. Additionally, natural language processing (cs.CL) may be a relevant sub-category as the paper discusses experiments and validation. Finally, data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) may also be a possible sub-category as the paper discusses theoretical comparisons."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
