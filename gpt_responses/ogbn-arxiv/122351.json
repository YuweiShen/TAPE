Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the impact of physical parameters of the IRS on the FSO channel, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also develops a statistical channel model, which can be used for performance analysis, and this falls under the category of optimization and control (cs.OH). The paper also discusses the impact of building sway on the FSO channel, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the system design, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
