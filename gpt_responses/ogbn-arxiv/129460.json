The primary focus is on reducing the size of the embedding tables, which is a common challenge in deep learning-based recommendation systems. The paper proposes a novel approach for reducing the embedding size by exploiting complementary partitions of the category set. This approach is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), natural language processing (cs.CL), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Among these sub-categories, cs.LG is the most likely as the paper deals with deep learning-based recommendation systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
