The focus on safety-critical applications and the need for formal guarantees on predictions suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The use of Gaussian processes and weak convergence to GPs suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. The evaluation on a GP regression problem and a deep neural network suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
