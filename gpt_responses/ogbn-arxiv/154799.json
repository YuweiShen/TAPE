The paper also discusses the use of connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and its extension of CTC/attention architectures, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves the use of thresholding and signal processing techniques, which are relevant to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and systems and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
