The paper also addresses the issue of Byzantine attacks, which is a security concern in distributed systems, indicating cs.DC and cs.CR as possible categories. The paper proposes a new algorithm that does not require any information about the number of attackers and the Lipschitz constant, which involves information theory and optimization, suggesting cs.IT as another possible category. Finally, the paper conducts experiments on training multi-class logistic regression and convolutional neural networks, which are common tasks in artificial intelligence, indicating cs.AI as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
