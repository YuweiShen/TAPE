The paper also discusses a design pattern for secure data handling, which could be relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and security and privacy (cs.SI). The use of Matrix Market format for inputting problems suggests a focus on computational engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the use of FORTRAN and MATLAB languages suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and machine learning (cs.LG), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
