This work involves natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR), which are both subfields of computer science. Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also uses deep learning techniques, which fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper uses cross-lingual word embeddings, which can be considered a form of cross-lingual transfer learning, which is a topic in cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
