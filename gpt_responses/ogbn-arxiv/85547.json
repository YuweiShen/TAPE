The paper also proposes a method for optimizing the precoders and equalizers to mitigate interference, which is a problem in control systems (cs.SY) and signal processing (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of scalar feedback signals to regulate transmission power, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
