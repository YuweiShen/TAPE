The use of machine learning algorithms and data augmentation techniques also suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the challenges of defining spatial borders between classes, which could relate to information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
