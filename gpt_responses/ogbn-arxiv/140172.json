The focus of the paper is on improving the calibration of probability estimates generated by online boosting ensembles. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also mentions cost-sensitive classification, which falls under cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) and computer vision, which falls under cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
