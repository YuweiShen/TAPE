Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of deep neural nets, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The approach is based on two key observations, which involve the use of big-data sets and simple memorization, respectively, indicating the relevance of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with the matching of 2D pose estimation with 3D mocap data, which falls under the category of cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
