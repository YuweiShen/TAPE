The paper also discusses the use of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and control engineering (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of function approximations and gradient-based approaches, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and computational engineering (cs.CE).
