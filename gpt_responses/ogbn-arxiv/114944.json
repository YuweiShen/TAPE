The system uses a regression model to predict the runtime of a job and rank potential causes of slowdowns based on the relative contributions of features used to train the model. This work involves distributed computing, machine learning, and software engineering, which are all covered by the arXiv CS sub-categories of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Software Engineering (cs.SE), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
