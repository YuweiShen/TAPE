This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the potential advantages of Holographic MIMO, which relates to signal processing (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges in modeling Holographic MIMO channels, which involves physical modeling (cs.PHYS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
