The paper also presents tools based on LLVM low-level intermediate code representation, which could be applied to a number of programming languages, indicating a focus on programming languages (cs.PL). The paper discusses the use of automated grading in providing feedback to students, which is relevant to the category of computer science education (cs.ED). The paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques for similarity measurement, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the potential real-world applications of the presented tools, which could be relevant to the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
