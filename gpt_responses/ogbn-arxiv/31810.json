It also involves communication systems (cs.COMM) and networked systems (cs.NI) due to the analysis of two-user channels. The paper also discusses the use of coding schemes, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper provides design criteria for achieving DMT-optimality, which involves optimization and algorithms (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
