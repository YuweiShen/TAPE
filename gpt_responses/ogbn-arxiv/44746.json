Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the mathematical foundations of signal processing and communication. The paper also discusses applications in computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), signal processing (cs.SP), and multimedia (cs.MM), which are all relevant subfields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
