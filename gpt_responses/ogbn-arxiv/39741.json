The use of hierarchical information to improve classification accuracy suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The mention of textual classification also suggests cs.CL (Computation and Language) as a possibility. Finally, the use of neural networks and loss functions suggests cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
