This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The method also involves image processing (cs.CV) and data structures (cs.DS) as it deals with constructing adjacency graphs. Additionally, the method involves similarity measures (cs.SI) as it seeks an optimal kernel from the neighborhood of candidate kernels."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
