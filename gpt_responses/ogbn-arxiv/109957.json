The use of discrete Morse theory and optimization algorithms suggests that the paper could also fall under the categories of data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The mention of \"huge inputs\" implies that numerical analysis (cs.NA) may also be relevant. Finally, the proposal of a new library of test examples suggests that graph theory (cs.GT) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
