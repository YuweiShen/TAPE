The paper proposes a new algorithm that achieves optimal regret bounds in both adversarial and stochastic settings, without prior knowledge of the regime and time horizon. This is a fundamental problem in online learning and optimization, and is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
