This problem can be seen as a graph optimization problem, which falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes an algorithmic solution to a real-world problem, which involves making decisions based on data and optimizing a cost function. This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence. \n3. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) - The paper proposes an algorithmic solution to a problem that involves finding optimal locations for new servers. This problem can be seen as an optimization problem, which can be solved using neural and evolutionary computing techniques. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with the problem of finding optimal locations for new servers in a road network, which can be seen as a social and information network problem. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper proposes an algorithmic solution to a real-world problem, which involves optimizing a cost function.
