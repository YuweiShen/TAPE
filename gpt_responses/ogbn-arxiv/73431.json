The paper specifically focuses on weight initialization techniques for DNNs, which falls under the category of optimization and learning in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper mentions experiments on practical datasets, which suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the vanishing/exploding gradient problem, which is a common issue in neural networks and falls under the category of numerical analysis (cs.NE). Finally, the paper proposes a data-dependent initialization technique, which could also fall under the category of data mining (cs.DM) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
