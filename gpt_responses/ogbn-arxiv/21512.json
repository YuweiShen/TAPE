This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of microarray data suggests that the paper may also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories.
