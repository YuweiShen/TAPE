This work involves declarative problem solving, which is a common theme in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of tree decompositions and dynamic programming algorithms is related to the Data Structures (cs.DS) and Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-categories. The use of ASP as a tool for solving the problem is related to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. Finally, the focus on building a tool for rapid prototyping of algorithms is related to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
