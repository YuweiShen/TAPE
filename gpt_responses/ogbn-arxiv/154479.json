The paper also discusses the choice of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for self-supervised learning, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The authors also mention using neural networks for feature extraction (cs.NE) and evaluating their results on image classification benchmarks (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
