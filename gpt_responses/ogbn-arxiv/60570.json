As such, it could fit into several arXiv CS sub-categories. \n\nFirstly, cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is a likely category as the paper focuses on improving the performance of content-centric networking at internet scale. \n\nSecondly, cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) is another possible category as the paper discusses the security benefits of using small forwarding tables that are immune to Interest-flooding attacks. \n\nThirdly, cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) is a possible category as the paper proposes a new approach to routing that could improve the efficiency of distributed content delivery. \n\nFourthly, cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) is a possible category as the paper discusses the advantages of content-centric networking for managing and delivering large amounts of data in social and information networks. \n\nFinally, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is a possible category as the paper proposes a new data structure for routing that could improve the efficiency of content-centric networking."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
