The paper also discusses methods used in other papers on this subject, which could fall under computational complexity (cs.CC) or graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper mentions the problem of determining the automorphism group of a putative self-dual code, which could be considered a topic in cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
