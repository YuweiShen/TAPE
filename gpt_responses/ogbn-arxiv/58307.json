Therefore, cs.IR and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes algorithms based on hash tables, which are commonly used in data structures (DS) and databases (DB), making cs.DS and cs.DB likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper involves optimization of search efficiency and accuracy, which falls under the scope of machine learning (LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
