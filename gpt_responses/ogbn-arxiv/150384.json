It also conducts extensive experiments to support the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n\nIt may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as VAE is a popular generative model in AI research. \n\nThe paper's focus on improving reconstruction loss suggests it may also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as image reconstruction is a common task in computer vision. \n\nThe use of VAEs in modeling complex systems suggests it may belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). \n\nFinally, the paper's analysis of why the aggregated posterior may fail to match the unit Gaussian prior suggests it may belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
