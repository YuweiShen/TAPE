The paper also discusses various noise models and their impact on the minimax label complexity. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also involves combinatorial complexity measures, which could place it in cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
