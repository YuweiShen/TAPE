The most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), as the lambda calculus is a foundational concept in logic. The paper also covers topics related to programming languages, such as type inference and denotational semantics, which could place it in sub-categories such as cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.TL (Programming Language Theory). The Curry-Howard isomorphism, which relates types and logic, could also place the paper in cs.SE (Software Engineering) or cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
