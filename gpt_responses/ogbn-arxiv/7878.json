The use of local expansion methods and spectral clustering suggests that the paper could be classified under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The focus on large graphs and the use of parallelization also suggest cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SD (Software Engineering). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed algorithm on different datasets and the analysis of seed set quality and quantity suggest cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
