The focus is on non-parametric statistics based on sample covariance matrices, which is a topic of interest in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the sensitivity of the statistics to the number of sources and sample size, which are relevant topics in multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SP). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of uncertainty in noise variance, which is a problem in statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
