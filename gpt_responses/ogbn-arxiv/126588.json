The paper also discusses the development of a computational paradigm for problem-solving, which is relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY). The use of image-like representations suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV), and the use of generic operators and modularization suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
