The paper proposes a novel bound computation method on an efficient measurement domain for MF estimation, i.e., the extended Gaussian image (EGI), which is a well-known representation for planar structures. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of consensus set maximization and branch-and-bound algorithms, which are common techniques in machine learning and optimization. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG), graphics (cs.GR), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
