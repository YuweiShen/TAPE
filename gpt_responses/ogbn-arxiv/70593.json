This topic falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses transfer learning, which is a common technique used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The authors propose a metric to quantify generality, which involves analyzing the learned filters, which could fall under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the authors apply their metric to several datasets, which could fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
