It also involves the concept of measures, which is related to information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the construction of subshifts, which is a topic in logic and computation (cs.LO). The use of cellular automata to realize subshifts can also be seen as a control and systems engineering problem (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves the study of probabilities and patterns, which are topics in discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
