These tasks are commonly associated with sub-categories such as Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Software Engineering (cs.SE), and Databases (cs.DB). Additionally, the paper focuses on scholarly knowledge graphs, which suggests a potential fit with sub-categories such as Digital Libraries (cs.DL) and Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). However, given the emphasis on knowledge discovery and semantic similarity measures, we believe that cs.AI, cs.IR, cs.SI, cs.SD, and cs.DB are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
