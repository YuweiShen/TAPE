The paper also discusses using these statistics for statistical analysis, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper proposes a new algorithm for computing these statistics, which involves dynamic programming and contingency table algebra, both of which are topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses using these statistics for feature selection and Bayesian network learning, which are topics in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
