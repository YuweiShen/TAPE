The paper discusses techniques for propagating input intervals through layers of a network and improving the tightness of these bounds. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), cryptography (cs.CR), and neural networks (cs.NE). However, given the focus on training deep neural networks and improving their robustness, we believe that cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.AI, cs.CR, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
