The proposed architecture involves using an outer product to model pairwise correlations between embedding dimensions, followed by a convolutional neural network to learn high-order correlations. This work is therefore likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
