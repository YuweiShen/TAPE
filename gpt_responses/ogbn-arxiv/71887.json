The use of regularization terms to encourage spatial coherence and data fidelity also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The optimization algorithm used in the paper, block coordinate descent, is commonly used in numerical analysis and optimization (cs.NA), which could also be a likely sub-category. The use of directional information and interaction between neighbor voxels suggests that it could belong to the information theory (cs.IT) or signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
