Additionally, the paper mentions the use of deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also discusses the robustness of the watermarking technique, which is a common concern in the cryptography (cs.CR) community. Finally, the paper mentions the use of attention-based mechanisms, which are commonly used in natural language processing (cs.NE) and information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
