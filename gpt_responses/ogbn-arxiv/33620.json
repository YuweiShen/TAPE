The paper discusses the performance of neural Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) models, which falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the ability of these models to perform inference-oriented reasoning, which involves logical reasoning and decision making, indicating the relevance of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Learning). The paper also discusses the generalization of these models, which falls under the category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper proposes a strategy for formulating questions using parallel passages, which falls under the category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
