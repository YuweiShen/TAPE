The paper also mentions experiments on image datasets, which further supports this category.\n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with multimodal retrieval, which is a core topic in multimedia research.\n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses retrieval of similar items from a database, which is a core problem in information retrieval.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel model for multimodal hashing, which involves learning mappings and quantizers. This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with retrieval of similar items across different modalities, which can involve natural language processing and speech recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
