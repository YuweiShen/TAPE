The study also involves cognitive biases in human decision making, which could be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. The experiments and analysis of inter-annotator agreement could be considered as machine learning (cs.LG) or cybernetics (cs.CY) topics. Finally, the discussion of the impact on future annotation efforts and parser evaluations could be relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
