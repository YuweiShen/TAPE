The relay channel is a common model in cooperative communication, which involves a source, a relay, and a destination. The paper proposes an achievability result for the general relay channel, which involves multiple sources and relays. This result is relevant to various applications in networking (cs.NI), signal processing (cs.SI), communication engineering (cs.CE), and multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
