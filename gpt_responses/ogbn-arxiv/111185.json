The paper also focuses on software engineering practices for developing such frameworks, which suggests a potential fit for the software engineering (cs.SE) category. The use of a graphical interface and automation techniques for configuration and optimization suggests a potential fit for artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) categories. Finally, the paper discusses the extensibility of the framework, which suggests a potential fit for the systems and control (cs.SY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
