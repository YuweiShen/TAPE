The paper also mentions the processing of video frames and the use of multimedia subsystems, which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) as possible sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of a balanced cluster-tree topology, which is a common approach in control systems (cs.SY).
