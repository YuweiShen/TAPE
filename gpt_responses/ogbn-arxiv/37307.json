The use of motion estimation also suggests that it could be related to robotics (cs.RO) or multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The fact that the approach involves training a deep network suggests that it could also be related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
