The paper also discusses the effect of hardware impairments on full-duplex system performance, which falls under the category of system and control (cs.SY). The experimental results presented in the paper involve signal processing and measurement techniques, which could be classified under multimedia (cs.MM) and performance analysis (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
