The use of online hard keypoint mining loss and feature pyramid network also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.AI) and deep learning (cs.LG). The application of the proposed algorithm to generate human bounding boxes also suggests a possible connection to robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM) for further research and development."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
