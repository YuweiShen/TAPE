This falls under the scope of scientific computing (cs.SC) and computational geometry (cs.CG). The use of symbolic computations and the complexity analysis suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the mention of an isomorphism between real algebraic sets suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
