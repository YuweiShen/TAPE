The introduction of a new rewrite formalism and a modular dependency pair framework suggests a focus on formal methods (cs.FL) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the implementation of the framework in a higher-order termination tool suggests a focus on scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
