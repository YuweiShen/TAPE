The authors also mention adapting Person Re-Identification models, which is a popular topic in computer vision research. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia) - Fashion retrieval involves analyzing and processing multimedia data, such as images and videos. The paper discusses the challenges of dealing with different domains of images, which is a common problem in multimedia research. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The task of fashion retrieval involves finding an exact match for fashion items within an image, which is similar to the task of information retrieval. The paper also discusses previous work in fashion retrieval, which is a subfield of information retrieval. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The authors mention using deep learning models for fashion retrieval, which is a subfield of machine learning. The paper also discusses the use of a baseline model and conducting experiments to validate results, which are common practices in machine learning research. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - Although less likely, the paper does involve analyzing and processing language related to fashion items, such as clothing categories and attributes. The authors also mention using natural language processing techniques for fashion retrieval, which is a subfield of computation and language."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
