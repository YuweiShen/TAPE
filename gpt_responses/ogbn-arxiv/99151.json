The paper specifically addresses the issue of noisy labels, which is a problem that arises in computer vision tasks such as image classification. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel two-phase training method, which involves early stopping and resuming training using a maximal safe set. This method is related to optimization and convergence, which are topics covered in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper also discusses the impact of label noise on generalization, which is a topic in cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
