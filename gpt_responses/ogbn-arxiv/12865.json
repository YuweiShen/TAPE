The paper also extensively uses machine vision and deep learning techniques for processing the tactile data, which suggests that it could also be classified under computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the potential applications of the tactile Model O in autonomous object handling suggest that it could also be classified under systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
