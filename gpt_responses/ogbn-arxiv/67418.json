This involves utilizing spatial and semantic information conveyed through the command to learn a distribution over the metric and semantic properties of spatially extended environments. The algorithm uses this distribution to interpret the natural language instruction as a distribution over the intended behavior, and a belief space planner reasons directly over the map and behavior distributions to solve for a policy using imitation learning. This work involves robotics (cs.RO), natural language processing (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.AI), and possibly computer vision (cs.CV) and statistical learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
