This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The proposed method involves the use of global and local features, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper deals with perspective changes, which is a common problem in robotics (cs.RO) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
