The paper also proposes a novel embedding approach that incorporates object detection and spatial awareness, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI). The use of embeddings also suggests that the paper may fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The experiments involve video datasets, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves natural language processing techniques to determine object relevance in a word embedding space, which suggests that it may also belong to the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
