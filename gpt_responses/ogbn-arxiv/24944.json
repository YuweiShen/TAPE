This falls under the intersection of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper proposes a novel approach for generating token-level video summaries guided by each word in the question, which involves incorporating features from multiple modalities, a common challenge in AI research. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
