The use of compressed counting and random projections also suggests a connection to machine learning and data mining (cs.LG). The application of the algorithm to Web crawl data suggests a connection to databases (cs.DB) and possibly social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
