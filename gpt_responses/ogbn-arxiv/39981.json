The paper also emphasizes the concept of abstraction, which is a key aspect of programming languages (cs.PL) and object-orientation (cs.OO). Additionally, the paper discusses the application of object-orientation in different phases of software development, which could fall under software design (cs.SD). Finally, the paper mentions confusion and obscurity with object-orientation, which could relate to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and the need for better user interfaces and documentation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
