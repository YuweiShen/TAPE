The paper specifically focuses on the problem of oscillation in momentum-based optimizers, which is a common issue in deep learning. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed optimizer on image classification tasks, which suggests that it may also be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
