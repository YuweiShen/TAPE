It also introduces a novel data structure for sparse sequences, which falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS). The paper discusses worst-case local decoding and update efficiency, which are related to the performance of compression algorithms, and thus falls under the category of data compression (cs.DC). The paper also mentions entropy-achieving compression, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency of local decoding and update algorithms, which is related to the performance of algorithms, and thus falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
