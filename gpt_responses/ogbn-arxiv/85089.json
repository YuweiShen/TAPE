Therefore, cs.AI and cs.LG are the most likely categories. The paper also deals with the challenges of operating in uncontrolled environments, which falls under the scope of cs.SI and cs.SY. Finally, the paper discusses the suitability of different calibration approaches for wearables and IoT deployments, which is related to cs.SE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
