The paper also discusses the properties of various graph classes, such as quasi-planar graphs and 1-planar graphs, which are related to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.GT). The use of upward digraphs also suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper explores the practical applications of these graph classes, which could fall under social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
