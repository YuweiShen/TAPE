This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT), network infrastructure (cs.NI), and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper deals with the optimization of training length and selection of users, which falls under machine learning (cs.MM) and learning theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
