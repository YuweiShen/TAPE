Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also analyzes new types of attacks and their countermeasures, which falls under the category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). As NDN is a potential next-generation Internet architecture, the paper may also belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper sheds light on the debate about self-certifying vs. human-readable names, which could fall under cs.DL (Digital Libraries)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
