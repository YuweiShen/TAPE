The use of optimization techniques to design precoding methods also falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper specifically focuses on downlink analysis for a finite number of antennas, which is a sub-topic of massive MIMO (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implementation of the proposed methods, which could be relevant to communication and networking (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
