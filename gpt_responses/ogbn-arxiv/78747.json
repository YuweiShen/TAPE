Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The use of CNNs also suggests that the paper could belong to cs.DL (Machine Learning), and the evaluation of the system on different datasets indicates that it could be relevant to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the focus on historical documents and the need for accurate baseline detection could also make the paper relevant to cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
