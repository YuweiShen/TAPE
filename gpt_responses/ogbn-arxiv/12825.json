The use of group theory in the analysis of these codes also suggests a possible categorization in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the nonexistence of certain codes, which may fall under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the use of computational methods to study these codes may also suggest a possible categorization in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
