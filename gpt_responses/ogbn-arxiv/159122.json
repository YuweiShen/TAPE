The paper also introduces a logic for exceptions, which falls under the category of mathematical logic (cs.LO). The use of categorical tools such as adjunctions and limit sketches suggests a strong connection to category theory (cs.CT), which is often used in the study of programming languages. The paper also discusses the computational effect of exceptions, which is a topic in software engineering (cs.SE) and formal languages (cs.FL). Finally, the paper's focus on the syntax and semantics of exceptions suggests a connection to formal language theory (cs.FL) and theoretical computer science (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
