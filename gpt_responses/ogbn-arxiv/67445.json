This falls under the purview of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper presents a system model for a multiuser multiple-antenna system operating in a broadcast channel scenario. This involves networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper develops linear precoders based on block diagonalization for the rate-splitting multiple access system. This involves control and system theory. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper considers a multiuser multiple-antenna system, which can be used for multimedia applications such as video streaming. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): This paper does not seem to have any direct relevance to computers and society. However, it is possible that the proposed scheme could have implications for social networks or other communication systems used in society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
