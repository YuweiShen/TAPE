This is a key topic in information theory. \n\n2. cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper discusses the use of polar codes in the 5G New Radio (NR), which is an emerging technology. \n\n3. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper highlights the low encoding and decoding complexity of polar codes, which is a key aspect of computational complexity. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the operation of polar encoders and decoders, which are components of communication systems. \n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although not the main focus of the paper, polar codes have also been used in cryptography and security applications, which could make this category relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
