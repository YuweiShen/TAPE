The paper also reviews existing environments from this perspective, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO). The concept of lifelong learning is also relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes recommendations for devising suitable environments in the future, which could involve computer vision (cs.CV) techniques for creating realistic and diverse environments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
