This involves optimizing the global traffic condition over a large road network, which is a cooperative multi-agent control problem. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): as the paper proposes a novel algorithm that uses deep reinforcement learning for traffic signal network optimization. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): as the paper involves the use of deep reinforcement learning to optimize traffic signal networks. \n- cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): as the paper deals with a cooperative multi-agent control problem. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): as the paper proposes a system for traffic signal network optimization. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): as the paper deals with the optimization of traffic signal networks, which is a problem that is relevant to robotics and autonomous vehicles."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
