Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) sub-category of Computer Science, which is cs.CL. Additionally, the system uses named entity recognition and extraction, which falls under Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The system also uses a separate entity repository, which could fall under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the system was optimised for speed, which could fall under the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
