Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely category. Additionally, the paper deals with artificial intelligence and robotics, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics) possible categories.
