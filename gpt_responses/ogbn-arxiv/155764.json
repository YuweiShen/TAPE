The paper also discusses induced subgraph and minor containment testing, which are topics in graph theory and discrete mathematics. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The paper also involves some computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.GT) concepts, which make these sub-categories likely as well. Finally, the paper touches on some discrete mathematics (cs.DM) concepts, which is another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
