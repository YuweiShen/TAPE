The use of skyline queries and algorithms for efficient processing of such queries are also relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper proposes algorithms that utilize certain properties of skyline sets, which can be seen as a form of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the scalability of the algorithms with respect to the cardinality and dimensionality of the relations is also relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
