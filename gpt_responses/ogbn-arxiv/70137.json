The use of combinatory logic and type specifications also aligns with this sub-category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a tool for automatic composition of software components, which is a topic related to software engineering. The experiments also evaluate the usefulness of the approach in software engineering tasks.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers, which is a topic related to logic in computer science. The translation of the tree grammar into SMT functions also aligns with this sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents an approach for automatic composition of software components, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence. The use of SMT solvers and domain-specific constraints also aligns with this sub-category.\n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper uses tree grammars to represent composed terms, which is a topic related to formal languages and automata theory. The use of combinatory logic and type specifications also aligns with this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
