The paper also discusses the more general problem of stochastic controller optimization in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), which is a topic in control theory (cs.SY) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper's focus on computational complexity suggests that it may also be relevant to the field of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
