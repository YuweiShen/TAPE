Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also mentions the application of FDESs in biomedical control and robotic control, which suggests that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics) are also likely sub-categories. The paper presents a detailed computing flow to verify the controllability and observability conditions, which involves algorithmic and computational aspects, indicating that cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SE (Software Engineering) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
