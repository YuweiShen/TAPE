The paper also discusses the application of this model to extract structured information from real estate ads, which involves tasks such as entity identification and tree-structure construction, and can be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of neural architectures and attention mechanisms in the proposed model suggests that it may also fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper involves text analysis and information retrieval, which can be categorized under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
