However, given the focus on kernel methods and supervised learning, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses signal classification, which is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of random feature maps and analysis of convergence rates suggests a connection to neural networks and deep learning (cs.NE). Finally, the mention of expected Haar integration kernel suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
