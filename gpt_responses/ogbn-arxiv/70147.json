Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the reduction of computation burden and the use of shared-weight strategy, which are related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, respectively. Hence, cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper mentions the application of the proposed method in street-scene understanding for autonomous driving, which falls under the scope of robotics. Therefore, cs.RO (Robotics) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
