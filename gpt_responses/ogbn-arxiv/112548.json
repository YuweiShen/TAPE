This involves the use of 1-bit compressed sensing as a source encoder concatenated with a convolutional channel encoder, and an iterative joint source-channel decoding method for signal reconstruction. The paper also analyzes the convergence of the decoder using an extrinsic information transfer chart and modifies the soft-outputs of the source decoder to improve signal reconstruction performance. Based on these factors, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT (information theory), cs.SP (signal processing), cs.MM (machine learning), cs.LG (machine learning), and cs.SI (social and information networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
