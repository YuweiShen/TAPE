Specifically, it focuses on meta-learning, which is a subfield of machine learning that deals with learning to learn. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision), as these are the most relevant subfields for this work. Additionally, since the proposed method involves optimizing network parameters and storing local information in a dictionary, it may also be relevant to subfields such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SD (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
