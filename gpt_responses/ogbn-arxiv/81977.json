The paper also proposes a new strategy to improve the performance of existing algorithms, which involves using multiple discriminations and aggregating their results, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Additionally, the paper uses deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in the Multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the paper deals with the issue of anomaly detection, which is related to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
