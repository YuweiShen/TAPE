The proposed method uses meta-learning, which is a subfield of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.LG and cs.AI. Additionally, since the paper deals with the security aspect of face recognition systems, it could also be categorized under cs.CR. Finally, since the proposed method involves adapting to new spoofing types, it could also be related to multimedia (MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
