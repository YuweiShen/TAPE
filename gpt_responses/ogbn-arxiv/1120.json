This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The algorithm also uses techniques such as mini-batch gradient descent, regularization, initialization, and batch normalization, which are commonly used in neural networks and deep learning, making categories such as neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) and social and information networks (cs.SI) relevant as well. Finally, the paper deals with big data, which is a topic of interest in data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
