The use of constrained coding is also a common technique in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with relay networks, which are a key component of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper discusses the use of relays in a network, which is a topic that falls under social and information networks. \n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper deals with a distributed network of relays, which is a topic that falls under distributed computing. \n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper does not explicitly deal with computational complexity, but the problem of achieving broadcast capacity in a network can be a complex problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
