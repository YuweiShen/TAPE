This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to this sub-category.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the impact of smart vehicles on society and proposes a solution to address security and privacy concerns. This sub-category is also likely to be relevant.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the use of wireless remote software updates in the proposed architecture. This is a software engineering aspect and hence this sub-category is also likely to be relevant.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the use of blockchain technology to protect the privacy of users in the vehicular ecosystem. This is a social and information networks aspect and hence this sub-category is also likely to be relevant.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a distributed solution to automotive security and privacy using blockchain technology.
