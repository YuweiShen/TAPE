This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and involves the use of machine learning (cs.AI) for analyzing the dynamic environment and achieving adaptive access control. It also involves networking and communication (cs.NI) as well as system and control theory (cs.SY) for establishing connections between transceivers and enhancing security progressively. Finally, the paper mentions the use of online machine learning (cs.LG) for the proposed holistic authentication and authorization approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
