The use of hybrid precoding and combining transceiver architecture is a common technique in mmWave MIMO systems, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of artificial noise for jamming eavesdropper's reception, which is a signal processing technique (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes algorithms for secure transmission, which involves system design and optimization (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
