This falls under the scope of natural language processing (NLP) and information extraction, which are common topics in the cs.CL sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper also applies different machine learning algorithms on the cohort using the automatically generated keywords. This falls under the scope of supervised learning, which is a common topic in the cs.LG sub-category.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the impact of surgical site infections on healthcare costs and length of hospital stay, which falls under the scope of healthcare informatics and the societal impact of technology, which are common topics in the cs.CY sub-category.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes an automated approach to detect surgical site infections, which falls under the scope of computational healthcare and medical informatics, which are common topics in the cs.CE sub-category.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although not the main focus of the paper, the use of machine learning algorithms on clinical notes could potentially involve image analysis and computer vision techniques, which are common topics in the cs.CV sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
