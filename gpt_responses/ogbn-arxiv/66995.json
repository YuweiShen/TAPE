It involves reducing the rule-merging problem to a problem on CSS-graphs, which can be optimised using Max-SAT solvers. The paper also provides a formalisation of CSS3 selectors and reduces dependency detection to satisfiability of quantifier-free integer linear arithmetic. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL), Software Engineering (cs.SE), Computational Complexity (cs.CC), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
