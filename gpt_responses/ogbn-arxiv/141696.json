The paper also discusses the use of gradient information, which is a common feature in optimization and machine learning (cs.SC, cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper presents numerical examples that demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method, which is a common theme in control systems and optimization (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
