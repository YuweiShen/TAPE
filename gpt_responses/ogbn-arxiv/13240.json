The presence of side information at both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper is a key aspect of the paper, which suggests that it could also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper considers both coded and uncoded side information, which could be related to coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
