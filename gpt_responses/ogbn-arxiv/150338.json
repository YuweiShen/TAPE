It also uses reinforcement learning to train an agent to determine the value of instances and construct a new bag with less noisy instances. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) as it deals with distant supervision, a common technique in natural language processing. \n\nAdditionally, it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it uses a machine learning approach to solve a problem. \n\nIt may also fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as instance selection is a common task in information retrieval. \n\nFinally, it could be classified under cs.CV (Computer Vision) as instance selection is also a common task in image processing and computer vision."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
