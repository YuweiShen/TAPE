The focus on optimizing reception overhead suggests that the paper may also be relevant to systems and control (cs.SI) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DS). Finally, the use of density evolution equations for asymptotic analysis suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
