The use of MDS codes and the concept of sum capacity suggest a connection to coding theory (cs.DS) and communication complexity (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the efficiency of joint retrieval of desired messages, which could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
