The use of treemaps for this purpose also involves algorithms and data structures (cs.CG). The paper proposes a novel classification scheme for time-dependent tree datasets, which could be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and database systems (cs.DB). Finally, the paper evaluates the quality and stability of different treemapping algorithms, which could be of interest to the field of visualization and visual analytics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
