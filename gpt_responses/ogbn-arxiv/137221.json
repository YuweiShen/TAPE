It also involves the use of saliency maps and class activation maps, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. The paper also involves the use of an ADMM-based framework, which is a common optimization technique used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with security and privacy (cs.CR) as it involves attacking deep neural networks. Finally, the paper involves the use of group sparsity, which is a common technique used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
