This falls under the intersection of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper proposes a one-stage model for real-time REC, which involves innovative designs for feature selection and global attentive reasoning. These designs involve machine learning techniques such as adaptive feature selection and selective diffusion of visual information, which fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed model on benchmark datasets, which involves performance metrics and comparisons with prior works, falling under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
