Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SP (Signal Processing) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also provides analytical guarantees on the performance gain due to adaptive resource allocation, which involves optimization and machine learning techniques, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a likely sub-category as well. Additionally, the paper discusses the dependence on sparsity level, signal-to-noise ratio, and sensing resource budget, which are topics in mathematical modeling and optimization, making cs.MM (Mathematical Modeling) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper presents numerical simulations to demonstrate the tightness of the bounds, which involves computational methods and simulations, making cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
