The paper also discusses the challenges of detecting text with arbitrary shapes and close text instances, which are related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The proposed method, Progressive Scale Expansion Network, involves generating different scales of kernels and gradually expanding them to detect text instances with complete shapes, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
