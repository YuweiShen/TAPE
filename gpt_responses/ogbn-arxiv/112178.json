This makes it likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of graph regularization suggests it could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-categories. Finally, the experimental results involve image clustering, which suggests it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
