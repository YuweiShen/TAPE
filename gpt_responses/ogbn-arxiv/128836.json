The paper focuses on the technique of domain randomization to handle the variability in real-world data. This technique is commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) to train models that can generalize to different environments. The paper also discusses the importance of the parameters of the simulator, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the approach is evaluated on bounding box detection, which is a common task in computer graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
