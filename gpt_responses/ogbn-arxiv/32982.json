The paper also discusses the use of weight sharing, which is a common technique in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, falling under the category of natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper proposes a Bayesian approach to NAS, which is a common technique in neural networks and optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
