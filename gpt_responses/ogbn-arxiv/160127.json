Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the learning of network architecture, which falls under the category of machine learning and deep learning, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the prediction of future values, which is a common topic in the field of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of recurrent neural networks for robotics, which falls under the category of systems and control, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) another likely sub-category.
