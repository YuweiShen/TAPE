The paper also describes specification formalisms for describing properties of OSGi based systems, which could fall under the category of cs.PL (Programming Languages) or cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper mentions the potential use of the formalization for runtime monitoring, which could fall under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper mentions checking compatibility of implementation artifacts towards a specification, which could fall under the category of cs.DL (Digital Libraries) as it involves checking the compatibility of digital artifacts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
