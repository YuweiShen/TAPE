The use of Fourier transforms for computing underapproximations suggests a connection to signal processing and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of convex optimization, which is a common technique in numerical analysis and scientific computing (cs.NA). The paper deals with dynamic programming and value functions, which are concepts commonly used in the field of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with open-loop control policies, which suggests a connection to robotics and automation (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
