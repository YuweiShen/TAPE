The paper specifically focuses on un-discounted reinforcement learning under drifting non-stationarity, which involves both reward functions and state transition distributions evolving over time. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also involves algorithms and regret bounds, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
