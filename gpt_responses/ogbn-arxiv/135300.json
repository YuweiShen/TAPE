This topic falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the security implications of these vulnerabilities, which could fall under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. The proposed attacks are based on simple ideas and do not require any internal knowledge of the target network, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
