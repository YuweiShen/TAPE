Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves information theory and signal processing, which suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) as the second likely category. The use of directional transmissions and the need for control layer procedures suggest cs.COMM (Communication and Security) as the third likely category. The paper also involves analysis and optimization, which suggests cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) as the fourth likely category. Finally, the paper involves surveying and comparing techniques, which suggests cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) as the fifth likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
