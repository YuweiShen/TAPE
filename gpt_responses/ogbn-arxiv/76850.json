The proposed framework uses Multi-Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (MR-GCN) to encode spatial information and a recurrent network to label vehicle behaviours. This work involves computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, which are covered by the arXiv CS sub-categories of computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), and cryptography and security (cs.CR) as the dataset includes on-road scenes. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.RO, and cs.CR in descending order of likelihood."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
