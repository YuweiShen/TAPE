The use of real data for validation also suggests that it could fall under the category of data-centric computing (cs.DC). Finally, the focus on forecasting at a macro-area level suggests that it could also fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
