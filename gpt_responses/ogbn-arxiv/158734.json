Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of deep learning models, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with word embeddings, which are commonly used in information retrieval (IR) tasks, making cs.IR a likely category as well. The proposed method of using task-specific embeddings could also fall under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of neural architectures, which is a common topic in the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
