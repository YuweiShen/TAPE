Therefore, cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves proofs of equivalence and preservation of properties, which are common in the sub-categories of Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Computational Complexity (cs.CC). The use of recurrence suggests a connection to Data Structures (cs.DS), and the paper's focus on simplification and equivalence may also relate to Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
