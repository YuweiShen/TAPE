This topic is closely related to the fields of Social Computing (cs.SI) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SOC). The paper also mentions the use of PageRank, which is a common algorithm in Information Retrieval (cs.IR). The proposed approach to rank aggregation involves techniques from Social Choice Theory, which is a subfield of Decision Support Systems (cs.DS). Finally, the experiments conducted on Twitter and citation networks involve machine learning techniques, which fall under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
