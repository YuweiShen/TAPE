The paper also discusses the possible gain of joint processing of pilot and data symbols, which involves system-level considerations and optimization, making it relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of statistical methods to analyze the temporal correlation of channel estimation errors, which falls under the networked and distributed systems (cs.NI) sub-category. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) applications that rely on reliable and efficient communication over wireless channels."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
