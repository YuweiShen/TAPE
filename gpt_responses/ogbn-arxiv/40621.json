The paper also analyzes the theoretical channel parameter estimation performance, which falls under the category of statistical inference (cs.SI). The paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) as it discusses the behavior of the Fisher information measure. Additionally, the paper may be relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) as it discusses communication problems. Finally, the paper may be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) as it discusses the performance of receivers in demodulating signals."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
