This involves developing a meta dynamic pricing algorithm that learns an unknown distribution (prior) shared across products while solving a sequence of Thompson sampling pricing experiments. The algorithm addresses challenges related to balancing meta-exploration and meta-exploitation, and accounting for uncertainty in the estimated prior. The paper's focus on learning and optimization in the context of dynamic pricing and shared structure suggests that it is most likely to belong to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and economics and computation (cs.EC). The use of Thompson sampling and the need to account for uncertainty suggest that it could also belong to the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the use of a meta-learning approach suggests that it could belong to the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
