The use of deep neural networks also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The focus on mammogram images suggests that it could also belong to the medical imaging (cs.MM) sub-category. The use of conditional graph learning and the integration of two learning paths suggest that it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep neural networks for improved representation learning suggests that it could also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
