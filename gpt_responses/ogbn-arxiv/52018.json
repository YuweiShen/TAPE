The paper also discusses the impact of residual connections on learning, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper presents new architectures for Inception networks, which could be relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the models on the ImageNet classification challenge, which is a task related to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
