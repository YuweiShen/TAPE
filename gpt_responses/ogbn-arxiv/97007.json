The paper specifically focuses on bidirectional recurrent neural network language models (bi-RNNLMs) and proposes a novel structure called succeeding word RNNLMs (su-RNNLMs) to address the challenges posed by bi-RNNLMs. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which is dedicated to NLP research. The paper also discusses training efficiency and lattice rescoring, which are related to machine learning and optimization, respectively. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also presents experimental results, which involve evaluating the proposed model's performance, making cs.SD (Sound) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new neural network structure, which can be considered a contribution to the field of neural networks, making cs.SI (Systems and Control) another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
