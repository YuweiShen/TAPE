The proposed linear spectral estimators (LSPEs) are suitable for general nonlinear measurement systems, which suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. The paper also discusses mean-squared error bounds, which is a common topic in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Numerical Analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper presents results on synthetic and real-world phase retrieval problems, which suggests that it could also belong to the Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
