It also involves learning from raw image observations (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO), as the method is evaluated on a real-world robot. Additionally, the paper discusses semi-supervised learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) and the use of dynamical distances (cs.SY) to shape reward functions. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.LG and cs.AI, followed by cs.RO, cs.CV, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
