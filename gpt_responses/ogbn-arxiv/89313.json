The approach involves building a classifier to ascertain whether a wikilink is a potential source of reference or not, and recommending references to the target page from the reference section of the wikilinks that are classified as potential sources of references. This approach involves natural language processing and information retrieval techniques, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), and Digital Libraries (cs.DL). Additionally, the paper deals with scientific knowledge and references, which could also fall under the sub-categories of Cybernetics (cs.CY) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
