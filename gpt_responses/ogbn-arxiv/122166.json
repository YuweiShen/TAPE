The paper proposes a new approach called Masking that incorporates human cognition to speculate the structure of the noise transition matrix. This approach is evaluated on image classification datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Clothing1M. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
