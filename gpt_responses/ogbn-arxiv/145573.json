Specifically, the paper proposes a general framework for graph neural networks (GNNs) called EdgeNet, which unifies state-of-the-art GNNs. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
