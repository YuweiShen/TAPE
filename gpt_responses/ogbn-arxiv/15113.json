The use of Hadamard matrices and coding theory suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT). The algorithmic aspects of the problem, including running time and sample complexity, suggest a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the experimental evaluation of the proposed approach suggests a connection to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
