This falls under the scope of natural language processing (NLP) and text classification, which are common topics in the cs.CL category.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper applies a one-class support vector machine (SVM) to filter out texts deemed irrelevant to business sentiment. This is a common technique in information retrieval, which is a subfield of CS that deals with the representation, storage, organization, and access to information.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses machine learning techniques such as RNN and SVM to develop a new business sentiment index. This falls under the scope of machine learning, which is a broad subfield of CS that deals with the development of algorithms that can learn from data.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses AI techniques such as RNN and SVM to develop a new business sentiment index. This falls under the scope of AI, which is a subfield of CS that deals with the development of intelligent agents that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper proposes a new approach to analyzing business sentiment using newspaper articles.
