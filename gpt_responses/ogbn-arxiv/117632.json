This involves information-theoretic concepts such as secrecy rate and channel state information. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper is focused on physical layer security, which is a subfield of cryptography and security that deals with securing communication at the physical layer. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper is related to communication systems and proposes a new scheme for securing wireless communication using OFDM. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new system for secure communication using FD TR-based OFDM SISO system, which involves control and optimization of the AN energy to maximize the secrecy rate. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper uses OFDM, which is a common modulation technique used in multimedia communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
