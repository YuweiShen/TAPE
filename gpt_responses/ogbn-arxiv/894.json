Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which covers topics related to signal processing, communication, and data compression. The paper also involves system modeling and control, which falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper proposes fusion rules based on statistical inference, which could be categorized under cs.MA (Machine Learning) or cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Finally, the paper deals with optimization and complexity reduction, which could be classified under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
