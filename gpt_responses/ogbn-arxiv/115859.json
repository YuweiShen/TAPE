The proposed model also involves global information aggregation, which is a technique used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The model is based on 3D U-Net, which is a neural network architecture commonly used in medical image analysis (cs.NE). Finally, the paper specifically focuses on multimodality isointense infant brain MR image segmentation, which falls under the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
