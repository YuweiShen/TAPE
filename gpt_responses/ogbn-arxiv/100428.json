The graphs are also intended for use in network design, which falls under the sub-categories of network architecture and analysis (cs.NI) and social and information networks (cs.SI). The emphasis on symmetry in the selection process suggests a possible connection to symmetry in computer science (cs.SY). Finally, the use of bisection width as a criterion for selecting optimal graphs suggests a possible connection to graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
