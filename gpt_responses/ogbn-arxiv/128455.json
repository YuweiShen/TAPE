As such, it is likely to fall under the categories of Logic (cs.LO) and Programming Languages (cs.PL). It also involves information theory (cs.IT) and data structures (cs.DS) in its construction of the two LTTs. Finally, the paper's use of conservative translations and novel techniques for proving conservativity may also place it under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
