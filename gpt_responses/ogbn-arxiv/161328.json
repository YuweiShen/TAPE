Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves the use of Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) which is a type of neural network, making it relevant to the sub-category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). The proposed approach involves load monitoring in residential buildings, which falls under the sub-category of Smart Homes and Buildings (cs.SI) and Computer Engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
