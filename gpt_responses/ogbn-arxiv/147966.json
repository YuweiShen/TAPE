The paper specifically focuses on blocking techniques, which are commonly used in data cleaning and deduplication. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DB (databases). The paper also discusses privacy-related issues, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.CR (security and privacy). Additionally, the paper evaluates the methods using synthetic datafiles, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.IR (information retrieval) and cs.DS (data structures and algorithms). Finally, the paper discusses computational complexity, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.CY (computational complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
