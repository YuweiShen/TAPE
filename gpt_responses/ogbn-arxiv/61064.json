It also involves the use of norms and rules to infer information from text, which is related to computational linguistics (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). The application domain of the system is car crashes, which could fall under computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) if the focus is on preventing accidents. Finally, the system uses textual descriptions to infer causes, which could be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) if the goal is to extract information from unstructured data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
