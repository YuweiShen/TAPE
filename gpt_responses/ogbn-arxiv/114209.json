The proposed scale regularization method also falls under the category of regularization techniques, which is a common topic in the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of variational methods is also a common topic in the sub-category of statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
