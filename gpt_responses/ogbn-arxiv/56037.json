The paper also discusses the challenges of analyzing protocols that rely on non-local, mutable state, which could be related to the category of programming languages (cs.PL) or distributed systems (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper proposes an adaptation of a tool for automated reasoning about protocols, which could be relevant to the category of software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper presents an example protocol to demonstrate the proposed approach, which could be related to the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
