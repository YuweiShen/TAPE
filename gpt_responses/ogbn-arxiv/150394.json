The use of graph neural networks (GNNs) is a key aspect of the proposed method, which falls under the category of graph-based machine learning (cs.CL). The paper also deals with large datasets and scalability, which are relevant to database systems (cs.DB) and systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
