The method uses a deep neural network design that integrates graph information such as brain connectivity with fully-connected layers. The approach leverages efficient graph filter design using Chebyshev polynomial and recent work on convolutional nets on graph-structured data. The paper also presents experiments on real MEG datasets to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
