Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The use of natural language also suggests that the paper could belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper proposes a novel deep tracking-by-detection formulation, which involves the use of deep learning techniques, indicating that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper deals with visual tracking, which is a subfield of multimedia, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
