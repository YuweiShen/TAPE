The paper also proposes novel methods based on denoiser-approximate message passing and Stein's unbiased risk estimator, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper evaluates its methods for compressive sensing MRI measurement matrices, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.IT, followed by cs.LG, cs.NE, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
