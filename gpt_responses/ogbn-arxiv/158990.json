This falls under the domain of digital libraries (cs.DL) as well as computational science (cs.CY), which includes the use of bibliometric analysis for research evaluation. The paper also involves statistical analysis (cs.SI) and optimization (cs.CE) techniques to quantify the sensitivity of bibliometric rankings. Finally, the paper deals with the distortion of performance rankings, which can be seen as a form of error analysis (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
