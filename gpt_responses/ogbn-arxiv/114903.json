It also involves the use of large-scale data-parallel SGD, which is commonly used in distributed deep learning. \n\nAdditionally, the paper mentions the use of convolution, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The smoothing effect of gradient noise may also be relevant to optimization problems in other areas of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). \n\nThe paper also involves distributed computing (cs.DC) as it discusses the implementation of the proposed method on parallel workers. Finally, the use of stochastic gradient descent and deep neural networks suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
