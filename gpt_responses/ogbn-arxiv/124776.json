This is a common problem in machine learning, and the paper proposes a new method to address it. Given that the paper focuses on image classification tasks, it is likely to fall under the categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, since the paper proposes a new method for less-forgetful learning, it could also be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
