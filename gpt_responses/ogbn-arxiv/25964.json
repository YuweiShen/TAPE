The proposed method, Sparse Switchable Normalization, involves optimizing importance ratios using a sparse constraint, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper evaluates the method on image and video datasets, which are often studied in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
