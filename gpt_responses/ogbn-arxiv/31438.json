This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT), as well as to data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of sketching techniques, which are commonly used in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and signal processing (cs.SI). Therefore, these five sub-categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
