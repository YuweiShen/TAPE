The paper presents theoretical results on the curse of dimensionality for certifiable robustness using different smoothing distributions, which is a common problem in machine learning and falls under the category of computational complexity and machine learning theory (cs.LG). The experiments are conducted on image datasets, which suggests that the paper could also fall under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also deals with adversarial attacks and defenses, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper proposes a new technique for certifiable robustness, which could also fall under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
