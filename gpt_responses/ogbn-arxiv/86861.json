The proposed framework is designed to provide resilient control for real-time UAV systems, which involves robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The framework also involves communication channels, which falls under networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents a software implementation of the framework, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
