The use of deep neural networks for hashing is also a common technique in computer vision.\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper is primarily concerned with retrieval tasks and improving retrieval scores. The use of semantic hierarchies and similarity measures is also a common technique in information retrieval.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a new loss function for training deep hashing systems, which is a common topic in machine learning. The use of deep neural networks and the empirical Kullback-Leibler divergence loss term are also common techniques in machine learning.\n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - The paper uses semantic hierarchies to form distance metrics between labels, which is a common technique in natural language processing. The use of semantic relations between labels is also a common topic in computational linguistics.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper focuses on retrieval tasks for multimedia data, which is a common topic in the multimedia community. The use of deep neural networks for hashing and the empirical Kullback-Leibler divergence loss term are also common techniques in multimedia research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
