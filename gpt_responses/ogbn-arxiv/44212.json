This involves techniques related to information theory (cs.IT), signal processing (cs.MM), and networking (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed methods in terms of bit error rate and sum-rate, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and system identification (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
