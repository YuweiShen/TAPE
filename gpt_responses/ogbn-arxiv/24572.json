The paper also proposes a framework that leverages prior experience to derive policies, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the efficiency of the proposed framework, which involves balancing search effort and edge evaluation, and this can be seen as a machine learning problem, falling under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of event-based toggles, which is a common technique in control systems and falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of simulated environments, which is a common theme in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
