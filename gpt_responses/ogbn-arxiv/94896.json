The proposed method involves transfer learning, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of neural networks for policy learning also falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of robust control and disturbance observer, which are topics in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the simulations involve visual perception and obstacle avoidance, which are topics in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
