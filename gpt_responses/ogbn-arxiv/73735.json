The paper proposes a new technique called $\\Delta-screening$ that can be incorporated into any community detection method that uses modularity as its objective function for clustering. This technique is generic and can be applied to a wide range of dynamic graphs, making it relevant to several sub-categories of computer science. \n\ncs.SI (Social and Information Networks) is the most likely sub-category as it deals with the analysis of social networks and the information that flows through them. The paper's focus on community detection in dynamic graphs aligns with the research interests of this sub-category. \n\ncs.SD (Software Engineering) is the second most likely sub-category as the paper proposes a new technique that can be incorporated into existing community detection methods. This technique can improve the performance of these methods, making it relevant to software engineering. \n\ncs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is the third most likely sub-category as the paper proposes a new algorithmic technique for community detection in dynamic graphs. The paper's focus on efficiency and speedups aligns with the research interests of this sub-category. \n\ncs.LG (Machine Learning) is the fourth most likely sub-category as the paper proposes a new technique that can be incorporated into machine learning algorithms for community detection.
