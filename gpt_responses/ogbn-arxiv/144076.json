This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Graphics (cs.GR), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), Robotics (cs.RO), or Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. However, since the focus is on the application of reinforcement learning to redirected walking, cs.GR and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses physical-space conditions with multiple obstacles, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a new approach to redirected walking, which may be of interest to researchers in the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
