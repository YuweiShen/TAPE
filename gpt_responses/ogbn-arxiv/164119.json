The paper also discusses the use of tournaments for training, which is related to game theory (cs.GT) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The comparison of agents trained in social settings to those trained in self-play environments involves the evaluation of learning algorithms, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and social influence (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
