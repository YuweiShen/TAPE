The use of error correcting codes also suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT). The modifications proposed to withstand attacks may involve computational complexity (cs.CC) or coding theory (cs.CE). Finally, the application of the approach to other variants of the cryptosystem may involve algorithms and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
