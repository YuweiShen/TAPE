The paper also proposes approaches based on integer linear programming (cs.PL) and decision tree learning (cs.LG) to analyze the program internals. Finally, the paper demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approach in debugging timing side-channel vulnerabilities (cs.CR) and availability vulnerabilities, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
