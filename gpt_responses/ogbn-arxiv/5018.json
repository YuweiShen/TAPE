The use of blocked clauses and propagation redundancy is related to propositional proof complexity, which falls under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). The study of hard principles such as pigeonhole principle and Tseitin tautologies suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of new inference rules and the analysis of their strength may also relate to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
