This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. The paper proposes a new patch-sampling procedure to increase network performance for small lesions, which involves generating non-uniform patches. This involves a certain level of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper also discusses the evaluation of the proposed approach, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR) as it involves testing the performance of the model on a hold-out test set."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
