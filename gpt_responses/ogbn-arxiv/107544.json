The paper also proposes new activation functions for neural networks, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the use of on-policy learning and softmax action selection, which are topics in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper validates its approach by achieving state-of-the-art results in the Atari 2600 domain, which involves computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
