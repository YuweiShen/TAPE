The framework introduced in the paper is general and can model a number of natural data collection processes, including processes with dependencies such as \"snowball sampling\" and \"chain sampling\", which are relevant to data science (cs.DS) and social network analysis (cs.SI). The paper also presents an efficient algorithm for estimating the mean of the test set, which involves solving a Grothendieck problem, a topic in optimization theory (cs.IT) that has applications in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG, cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
