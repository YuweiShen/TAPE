This involves analyzing the behavior of a large number of anonymous users having asymmetric service requirements, different service capabilities, and dynamically joining/leaving a crowdsourcing platform with imperfect monitoring. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.GT (Computer Science > Game Theory)\n- cs.CY (Computer Science > Cryptography and Security)\n- cs.SI (Computer Science > Social and Information Networks)\n- cs.DS (Computer Science > Data Structures and Algorithms)\n- cs.HC (Computer Science > Human-Computer Interaction)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
