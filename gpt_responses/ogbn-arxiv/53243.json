The proposed method for keyphrase extraction is language-independent and can be applied to any language, including Arabic, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the subfield of natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of hierarchical algorithms and distance/similarity measures for clustering suggests that the paper may also belong to the subfields of machine learning (cs.LG) and deep learning (cs.DL). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of eliminating noise words, which is a common issue in database systems (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
