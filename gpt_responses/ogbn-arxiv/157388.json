The paper also discusses the trade-off between completion delay and decoding complexity, which is a systems and control (cs.SY) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) problem. Finally, the paper proposes a new method for designing RLNC schemes, which involves circular-shift operations, which is a topic that falls under computer science and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
