Therefore, it is likely to belong to the categories of natural language processing (cs.CL), computer vision (cs.CV), multimedia (cs.MM), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Among these categories, cs.CL and cs.CV are the most likely as they directly relate to the paper's focus on combining text and video features for deception detection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
