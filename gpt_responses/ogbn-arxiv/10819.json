This makes it likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Communications (cs.COMM) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the performance improvement achieved by the proposed strategy, which involves processing large amounts of data, making it relevant to the Networked Systems (cs.NI) and Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a new approach to decision feedback detection, which involves making decisions based on previous decisions, making it relevant to the Data Structures (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
