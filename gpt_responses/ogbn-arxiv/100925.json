This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of recommender systems and preference learning indicates that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories.
