The paper also considers scenarios where the users and channel gains are not symmetric, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses diversity-multiplexing tradeoff, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the interference channels, which is a topic related to computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
