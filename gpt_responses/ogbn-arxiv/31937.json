The paper proposes a new reduction method called partial LLL (PLLL) and compares it with the effective LLL (ELLL) reduction, which involves computational complexity and numerical stability, topics related to data structures (cs.DS) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the effect of PLLL and ELLL on the search speed of a typical sphere decoding (SD) algorithm, which is a topic related to systems and control (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
