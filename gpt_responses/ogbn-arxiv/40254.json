The paper considers three post-grasp objectives, namely kinematic manipulation capability, torque effort, and impact force in case of a collision during post-grasp manipulative actions. These objectives are related to robotics, computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and control systems, which are all sub-categories of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SY (Control Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
