The paper presents two general approaches based on two representations of context-dependent utility functions, both of which are instantiated by means of appropriate neural network architectures. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.GT (Game Theory). The paper also deals with the problem of context-dependency, which is a fundamental problem in decision-making, and therefore, it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
