Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also mentions statistical channel models, real measurements, and ray-tracing data, which are related to information theory and signal processing, suggesting cs.IT (Information Theory) as the second likely category. The use of advanced architectural features, such as dual-connectivity, may fall under cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), while the focus on mmWave technology and its potential for multi-gigabit and low latency wireless links may relate to cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper emphasizes the use of discrete-event network simulation and the integration with an open-source simulator, which may fall under cs.COMM (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
