The watermarking is applied to image classification models (cs.CV) and the paper proposes a new algorithm that increases the capacity and flexibility of the embedded watermark message (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the robustness of the watermark against model transformation attacks, which is a common concern in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
