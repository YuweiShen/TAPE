This topic is closely related to computer graphics (cs.GR) and computer vision (cs.CV), where deformable objects are often simulated for animation and rendering purposes. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a simplistic constitutive model, which is a common approach in computational engineering (cs.CE). The paper also discusses the use of a feature vector and deformation substructuring, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.MM) and data analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
