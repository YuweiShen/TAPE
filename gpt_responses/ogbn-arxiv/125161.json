The paper also discusses how the encoding can be extended and adapted to specific applications, which involves logical reasoning and constraint satisfaction, making it relevant to Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). The Stable Marriage Problem is a well-known problem in Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) and the paper discusses how ties between preferences can be allowed, which is a topic in Computational Complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses how to select specific stable matchings which are optimal according to a given criterion, which is a topic in Game Theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
