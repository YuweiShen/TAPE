The emphasis on UML suggests that the paper may also belong to the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO), as UML is often used for formal specification and verification. The discussion of formalization and classification of different approaches also touches upon the topics of formal languages (cs.FL) and language theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
