The focus of the paper is on improving the user experience of these tools, which suggests that it belongs to the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses features that improve the understanding of non-obvious verification failures, which could fall under the programming languages (cs.PL) or logic in computer science (cs.LO) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the need for making these tools more accessible to nonexperts, which could fall under the education and training (cs.ET) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the demand-driven and unobtrusive presentation of helpful information, which could fall under the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
