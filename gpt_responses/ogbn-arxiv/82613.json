This involves modeling the task, environment, and user, and implicitly handling error using representations of robot dexterity. These topics are closely related to the fields of robotics (cs.RO), human-computer interaction (cs.HC), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), control systems (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
