The use of neural networks also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. The paper also deals with traffic congestion, which is a problem related to smart cities and intelligent transportation systems, indicating the possibility of the paper belonging to the social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses traffic data obtained from traffic control stations, which suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
