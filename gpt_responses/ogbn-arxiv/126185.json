The paper also uses a sequential decomposition methodology to find structured perfect Bayesian equilibria, which is a technique commonly used in reinforcement learning and decision making (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the phenomenon of informational cascades, which is a topic in social influence and network analysis (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of players making independent noisy observations of their states, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
