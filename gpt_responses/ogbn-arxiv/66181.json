The use of LBANN, a scalable deep learning framework optimized for HPC systems, suggests that this paper may also belong to the high-performance computing (cs.HC) sub-category. The mention of a new tournament-style training algorithm may indicate that this paper could also be classified under the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-category. Finally, the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) suggests that this paper may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
