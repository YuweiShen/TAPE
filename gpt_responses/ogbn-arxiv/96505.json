The paper also focuses on creating an intuitive mapping between the human hand and a non-anthropomorphic robot hand, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of objects to define the teleoperation subspace also involves computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the validation of the proposed subspace through teleoperation experiments involves control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
