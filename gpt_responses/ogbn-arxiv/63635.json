The paper specifically focuses on weight updates over mini-batches, which is a common technique in deep learning. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the application of the algorithm to computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SI), which are relevant subfields of machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
