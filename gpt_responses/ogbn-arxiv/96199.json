This involves learning patient subtypes and modeling physiological data streams associated with each subtype using a mixture of Gaussian Process experts. The paper also discusses the use of transfer learning techniques to learn the relationship between a patient's latent subtype and her static admission information. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
