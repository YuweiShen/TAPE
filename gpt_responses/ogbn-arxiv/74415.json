This involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA) for distributed belief aggregation. The proposed technique involves a market maker that rewards agents based on the quality of their reports, which requires techniques from machine learning (cs.LG) and scoring rules (cs.CR). The application domain of the technique is automated landmine detection, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) techniques for object classification. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI, cs.MA, cs.LG, cs.CV, and cs.CR, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
