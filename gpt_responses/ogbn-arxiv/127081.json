The use of resolvable designs and combinatorial structures also suggests a connection to discrete mathematics and combinatorics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the implementation of the codes, which could fall under systems and network architecture (cs.SI) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
