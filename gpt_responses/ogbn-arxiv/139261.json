The use of Poisson point processes and power control strategies suggests a focus on mathematical analysis (cs.MA) and system design (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the limitations of the network, which could fall under the category of performance evaluation (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
