This involves the use of multiple spatio-temporal data sources such as parking meter transactions, traffic speed, and weather conditions. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This is the most likely category as the paper proposes a deep learning model for prediction. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This category is also likely as the paper involves the use of AI techniques for prediction. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This category is relevant as the paper deals with the extraction of spatial relations of traffic flow in large-scale networks. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This category is relevant as the paper deals with spatio-temporal networks and the prediction of parking occupancy. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This category is relevant as the paper involves the use of Graph-Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN) for feature extraction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
