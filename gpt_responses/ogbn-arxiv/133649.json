The paper also discusses bit and message complexities, which are related to Information Theory (cs.IT). The selective broadcast model and its potential for directional transmissions may also fall under the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper deals with Byzantine faults, which is a topic in Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
