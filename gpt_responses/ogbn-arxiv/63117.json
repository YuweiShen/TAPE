The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other computational models also suggests that it could belong to machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. Additionally, the study involves human perception and cognition, which could make it relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
