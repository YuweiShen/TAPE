The use of shape priors and mesh representation also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The optimization problem formulation and solution using Markov random fields and graph cuts suggest that it could also belong to the mathematical software (cs.MS) sub-category. Finally, the use of gradient vector flows and the potential for extension to multiple interacting objects suggests that it could belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
