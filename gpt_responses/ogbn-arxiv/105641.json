This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision sub-category. \n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper aims to improve telepresence through the use of personalized avatars that model non-verbal behaviors. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the human-computer interaction sub-category. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with generating sequences of body pose and audio, which are both multimedia features. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the multimedia sub-category. \n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with modeling interpersonal dynamics through the use of selective attention, which is a natural language processing technique. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computation and language sub-category. \n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper deals with generating sequences of body pose, which is a key feature in robotics for tasks such as motion planning and control. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the robotics sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
