Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes new loss functions and a multihead attention mechanism, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), making cs.AI a likely category as well. The paper also discusses the use of dropout, which is a regularization technique commonly used in deep learning and machine learning, making cs.LG (Learning) a possible category. The paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed approach using ROUGE scores, which is a common evaluation metric in information retrieval (IR), making cs.IR a possible category. Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach to improve the abstractive summarization, which can be considered as a problem in optimization and can be related to neural networks, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
