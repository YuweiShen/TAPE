The proposed solution involves formulating the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and using online learning algorithms, which are also relevant to the fields of control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG) respectively. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of piece-wise linear functions to approximate state-value functions, which is a common technique in reinforcement learning (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
