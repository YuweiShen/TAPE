This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also involves constructions of new codes, which could fall under the computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-category. The use of MacWilliams identities and weight enumerators suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also involves duality and distance properties, which could fall under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves some algebraic structures and constructions, which could fall under the group theory (cs.GT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
