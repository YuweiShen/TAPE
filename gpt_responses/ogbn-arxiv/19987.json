The use of external knowledge to enrich the semantic content of the image representation suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The paper also mentions machine learning performances, indicating the use of machine learning algorithms, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The filtering phase mentioned in the second approach suggests the use of information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. Finally, the task of content-based image classification involves multimedia (cs.MM) processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
