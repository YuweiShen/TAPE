This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence and machine learning. \n2. cs.LG - The paper discusses the use of off-the-shelf reinforcement learning algorithms to compute optimal strategies from the observations of the MDP. This is a key aspect of machine learning and falls under the sub-category of Learning. \n3. cs.SY - The paper deals with control of an unknown model to maximize the chance of satisfying the objective. This falls under the domain of control systems, which is a sub-category of systems and control. \n4. cs.PL - The paper presents a constructive reduction from the almost-sure satisfaction of {\\omega}-regular objectives to an almost-sure reachability problem. This involves the use of automata theory and formal languages, which falls under the sub-category of Programming Languages. \n5. cs.MA - The paper deals with the application of machine learning techniques to solve a reinforcement learning problem. This falls under the sub-category of Multi-Agent Systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
