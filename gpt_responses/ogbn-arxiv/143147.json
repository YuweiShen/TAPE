Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the representation of curves as closed walks on a combinatorial surface, which suggests that it could be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The use of homotopy and self-intersections of curves could make it relevant to cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) and cs.GR (Graphics), respectively. Finally, the proposed algorithm for deciding if the geometric intersection number of a curve is zero involves logarithmic complexity, which could make it relevant to cs.SD (Sound)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
