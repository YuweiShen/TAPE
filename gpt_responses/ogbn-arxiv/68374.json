Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, since the proposed method is evaluated on a large multi-center mammography dataset, it may also belong to the medical imaging (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper also mentions a novel approach with data-driven decisions, which suggests that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the cost effectiveness of lesion annotation effort, which suggests that it may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
