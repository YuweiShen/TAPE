The paper also heavily relies on deep learning techniques to reason about code similarities, which suggests a potential fit for the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Additionally, the paper involves the transformation of code statements, which could potentially fit under the programming languages (cs.PL) category. Finally, the paper involves experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which could potentially fit under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
