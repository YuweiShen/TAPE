Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of communication and information processing. The paper also considers the partitioning of the antenna array into clusters, which falls under the sub-category cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel, non-linear equalization algorithm that builds upon approximate message passing (AMP), which could be categorized under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper analyzes the computational complexity of the proposed methods, which could be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
