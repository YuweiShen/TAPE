The paper uses techniques from property testing and erasure-resilient testing, which are central topics in computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.TR (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
