Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper discusses the influence of selection operators, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also presents experimental results, which could fall under the category of data structures (cs.DS) or computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
