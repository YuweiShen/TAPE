The paper uses tools from stochastic geometry to analyze the performance gains obtained by the proposed scheme. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves information theory and signal processing concepts, which makes cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.MM (Multimedia) likely sub-categories. The proposed scheme involves coordination between different tiers of base stations, which falls under the scope of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper also discusses the backhaul network, which is a key component of the overall system architecture and falls under the scope of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
