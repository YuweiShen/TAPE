The use of machine learning for modeling attacks suggests that the paper may also fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The focus on IoT applications and resource-constrained environments suggests that the paper may also fall under cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.CY (Cybersecurity). Finally, the use of computation units such as adders suggests that the paper may also fall under cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
