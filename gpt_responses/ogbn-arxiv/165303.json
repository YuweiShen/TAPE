The paper focuses on tabular reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of reinforcement learning that deals with finite state and action spaces. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) since the paper deals with algorithms and methods for estimating expected rewards. The paper also touches on multi-agent reinforcement learning, which falls under the category of cs.MA (Multiagent Systems), and robotics, which falls under the category of cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
