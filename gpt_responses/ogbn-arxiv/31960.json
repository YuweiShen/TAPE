Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SP (Signal Processing) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a new algorithm called Newtonized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (NOMP), which involves iterative refinements of parameters, and compares its performance with other classical and recent algorithms. This suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.SI (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
