This falls under the scope of information theory. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with distributed storage systems, which can be considered as a type of system. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper deals with distributed storage systems, which falls under the scope of distributed computing. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the communication required to rebuild a storage node after a failure, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
