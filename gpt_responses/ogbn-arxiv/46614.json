The use of highly efficient but non-linear power amplifiers at the base station (BS) is a signal processing technique, which falls under the category of signal and image processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of the number of BS antennas, which is related to the field of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implications of the proposed algorithm, which could be relevant to the field of computer communication (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
