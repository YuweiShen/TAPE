The focus is on interference management schemes in cellular networks, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of linear interference alignment (IA) scheme with symbol extension, which is a technique used in signal processing (cs.SI). The specific application of the study is in multiple access channels (MAC), which is a subfield of communication engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the paper deals with the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which is a topic in both signal processing and communication engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
