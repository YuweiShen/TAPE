This topic falls under the database (cs.DB) and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the security and privacy concerns (cs.CY) related to querying encrypted data and the need for efficient algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) to process encrypted data. Additionally, the paper addresses the software engineering (cs.SE) challenges of implementing and integrating FHE-based solutions into existing database systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
