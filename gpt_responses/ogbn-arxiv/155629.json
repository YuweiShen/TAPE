The use of a low-density parity-check code suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Networked and Distributed Systems (cs.NI) sub-category. The implementation of the proposed scheme may involve system-level considerations, which could place the paper in the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the use of numerical simulations suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
