This involves using multi-context term embeddings and an iterative end-to-end workflow. The paper is focused on natural language processing and information retrieval, which suggests that it is most likely to belong to the cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-category. However, the paper also involves machine learning techniques such as deep learning and embeddings, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.DL (Deep Learning). Finally, the paper also involves information retrieval techniques such as query expansion, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
