The paper specifically proposes a decoupled Bayesian stage to map uncalibrated probabilities to calibrated ones. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and computational linguistics (cs.CL). However, since the paper focuses on image classification benchmarks, cs.CV is more likely to be the primary sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
