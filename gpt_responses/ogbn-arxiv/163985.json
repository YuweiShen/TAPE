The proposed platform also aims to provide efficient data retrieval, which is a common concern in distributed computing. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper focuses on ledger data query, which is related to database management. The proposed platform also clusters and analyzes ledger state schemas, which is a common task in database management. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions the trust issue among enterprises, which is a common concern in cryptography and security. The proposed platform also aims to provide secure and flexible data query functions. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a ledger data query platform, which is a software engineering task. The platform also aims to meet the requirements of real applications built on Hyperledger Fabric, which is a software engineering concern. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper mentions Fabric SDKs and chaincode, which are programming languages used in Hyperledger Fabric. The proposed platform also provides sufficient interfaces for users to retrieve ledger data efficiently, which is related to programming language design."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
