This falls under the domain of computers and society.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper uses road networks and points of interest to identify and characterize urban parcels, which can be seen as a form of social and information networks.\n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper involves the use of data on road networks and points of interest to generate urban parcels, which requires database management and processing.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses a cellular automata model to simulate urban expansion, which is a form of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.GR (Graphics): The paper may involve the use of graphics to visualize the simulated urban expansion and compare different scenarios."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
