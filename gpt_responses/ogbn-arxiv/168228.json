The use of interferometry and spectral graph theory suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. The numerical simulations and comparison with an alternating-projections-type procedure suggest that the paper may also belong to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) or Signal Processing (cs.SP) sub-categories. Finally, the use of polarization suggests that the paper may belong to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category, which deals with network analysis and graph theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
