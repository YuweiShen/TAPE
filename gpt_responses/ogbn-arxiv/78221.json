The proposed method also involves promoting sparsity, which is a common theme in the Sparse and Low-rank Modeling (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper focuses on direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, which is a specific application of signal processing and falls under the Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
