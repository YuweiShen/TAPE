The use of encoder-decoder architecture and skip connections is also a popular technique in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of pyramid pooling modules, which is a technique commonly used in semantic segmentation (cs.AI). The dataset used in the paper is related to medical imaging, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the potential clinical application of the proposed method, which could be related to neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
