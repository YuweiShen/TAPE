This involves techniques commonly used in machine learning. \n\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper proposes a data completion approach to alleviate the problem of receivers not being shared across experiments. This is a common problem in computer vision and pattern recognition, where missing data is a common issue. \n\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the method of simultaneous sources (SS) with completed data, which involves analyzing data from multiple sources. This is a common problem in social and information networks. \n\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the use of stochastic algorithms for solving PDE inversion problems with many measurements. This involves the use of various data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
