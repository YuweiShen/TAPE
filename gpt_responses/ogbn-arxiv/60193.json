The use of discourse markers to automatically collect a classification dataset suggests a focus on discourse analysis, which falls under the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The use of machine learning to train the model suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The mention of achieving comparable generalization performance to state of the art models suggests a focus on neural networks (cs.NE) and possibly computer vision (cs.CV) if the sentence embeddings are used for image captioning or other visual tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
