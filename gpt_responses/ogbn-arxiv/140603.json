This involves the use of channel state information and data symbols to exploit interference constructively. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses a multiuser full-duplex wireless communication system where a radio base station serves multiple uplink and downlink users simultaneously. The proposed approach aims to improve energy efficiency in the wireless link. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a multi-objective optimization problem to study the trade-off between power minimization and quality-of-service for multiple users in a full-duplex wireless communication system. This involves the use of channel state information and data symbols to exploit interference constructively. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of generic phase shift keying (PSK) modulated signals and quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) signals in the proposed approach to accommodate constructive interference for downlink users. This is relevant to multimedia applications that require high-quality transmission. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although not the main focus of the paper, the use of channel state information and data symbols to exploit interference constructively could have implications for security and"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
