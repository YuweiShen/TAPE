Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the framework is compatible with scikit-learn models and workflows, which suggests that it could be used for tasks such as image classification (cs.CV) or natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper emphasizes the importance of code quality and documentation, which could be relevant to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
