The proposed framework also uses visual representations to capture spatial-temporal information, which is a common approach in computer vision.\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with natural language processing tasks such as video captioning and word representation. The proposed learning strategy also focuses on the relationship between visual content and corresponding words.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel learning strategy and an optimized architecture for video captioning, which are related to machine learning.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with a task related to artificial intelligence, i.e., video captioning, and proposes a new approach to improve the performance of existing methods.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with video captioning, which is a multimedia task.
