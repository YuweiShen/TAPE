This suggests that the paper could belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) category. Additionally, the paper focuses on the challenges of open-ended crowdsourcing, which involves distilling the right answer when workers do not agree with each other and selecting between many open-ended operators. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Cybersecurity (cs.CY), and Database (cs.DB) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
