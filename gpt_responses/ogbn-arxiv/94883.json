The use of linear coding schemes and the characterization of their performance suggest that the paper may also fall under the category of coding theory (cs.CC) and communication theory (cs.CE). Additionally, the problem of generating statistically independent secret keys may involve the use of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
