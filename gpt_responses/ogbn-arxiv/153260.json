This falls under the scope of programming languages research. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): While the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, it does discuss methods and tools to improve learning efficiency, which could potentially involve machine learning techniques. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses ways to reduce the difficulty of learning functional programming, which is relevant to software engineering education. \n- cs.ED (Education): The paper specifically focuses on the challenges faced by students learning Haskell, and proposes ways to improve their learning efficiency. This falls under the scope of education research. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses ways to improve the learning efficiency of students, which could involve designing better user interfaces or educational tools.
