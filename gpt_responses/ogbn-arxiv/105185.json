Therefore, the most likely category is cs.SE (Software Engineering). The paper also discusses the potential impact of affect on human-computer interaction (cs.HC), cybernetics (cs.CY), social informatics (cs.SI), and computer engineering (cs.CE). These categories are also relevant because they deal with the interaction between humans and technology, the social context of technology use, and the design and development of computer systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
