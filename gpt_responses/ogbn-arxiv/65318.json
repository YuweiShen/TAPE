The paper also discusses approximation algorithms based on sparsest cut and spreading metrics, which are topics in information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions inapproximability results, which are often studied in the context of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
