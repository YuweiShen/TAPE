Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the use of millimeter wave (mmWave) technology for wireless backhaul, which falls under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also involves optimization and scheduling algorithms, which could be categorized under cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper discusses energy efficiency, which could be categorized under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
