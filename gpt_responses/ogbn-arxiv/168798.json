The use of cellular neural networks (CeNNs) also points towards the areas of neural networks and analog circuits (cs.NE and cs.AR). The case study on target-tracking suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV), while the evaluation framework and comparison to von Neumann algorithms suggest a focus on system-level design and optimization (cs.SY). Overall, the most likely categories are cs.ET (Embedded Systems) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
