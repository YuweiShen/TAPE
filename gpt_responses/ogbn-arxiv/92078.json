The paper also discusses the use of neural networks for learning parity models, which could fall under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of erasure coding and the focus on resilience to slowdowns and failures could fall under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) or control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of ParM on a variety of inference tasks, including image classification and object localization, which could fall under the category of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
