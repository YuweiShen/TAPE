The techniques used in the paper involve recursion and reduction to a new problem, which are common techniques in the areas of data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The problem also involves the study of formal languages (cs.FL) and information theory (cs.IT) in terms of the number of queries required for testing. Finally, the paper presents upper and lower bounds, which are often studied in the area of learning theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
