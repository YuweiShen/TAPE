The use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) also suggests a focus on networking and internet technologies (cs.NI). The paper proposes a novel architecture for DNS-over-TLS, which involves the design and implementation of a DNS Recursive Resolver (RecRes), indicating a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the use of Remote Attestation to authenticate the RecRes suggests a focus on system security and trust (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
