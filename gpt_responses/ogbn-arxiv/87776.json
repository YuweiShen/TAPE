The paper proposes a novel iterative approach for event coreference resolution that uses machine learning techniques to build event clusters by exploiting inter-dependencies among event mentions. This involves using pairwise classifiers to distinguish within- and cross-document event coreference links, and then combining arguments from both event clusters after every merge. Given the focus on NLP and machine learning, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Other possible sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
