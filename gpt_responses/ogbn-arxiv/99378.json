The paper also provides a declarative model-theoretic semantics, which is related to logic and semantics (cs.LO). The addition of inheritance enhances the knowledge modeling features of the language, which is related to programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). The paper also encodes classical nonmonotonic problems, which is related to computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the language on top of the DLV system, which is related to databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
