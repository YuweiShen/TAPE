The focus on efficient arithmetic and the use of large prime finite fields suggests a stronger connection to cs.CR and cs.IT, but the paper also includes theoretical results on the existence of PMNS and the properties of suitable polynomials, which could be of interest to researchers in cs.DS, cs.NT, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
