Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses cartographic map projections, which falls under the category of graphics (cs.GR). The proposed representation for deep spherical image inference is based on a geodesic grid, which is a mathematical concept and could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper improves semantic segmentation results, which is a problem in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
