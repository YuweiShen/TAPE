The application of these methods is specifically targeted towards lifelong learning for robotics (cs.RO), which involves continuous adaptation to changes in the environment. The paper also discusses the use of these methods for computer vision tasks (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the trade-off between time, memory, and accuracy in approximation schemes, which is relevant to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
