This involves performing billions of \"short\" random walks in parallel across a cluster of machines to attain a fingerprint of the PPR vector of each vertex. The paper also discusses the highly efficient vertex-centric decomposition method used to compose the new PPR vector at query time. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are as follows: \n\n1. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a distributed framework for computing PPR vectors efficiently on large graphs, which involves performing billions of \"short\" random walks in parallel across a cluster of machines. This involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms for indexing and querying the PPR vectors. \n\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the use of PPR vectors for ranking nodes in large graphs, which is a common problem in social and information networks. The proposed framework is designed to scale to large graphs, which is a key challenge in this area. \n\n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of PPR vectors for ranking nodes in large graphs, which is a common problem in information retrieval. The proposed framework is designed to scale to large graphs, which is a key challenge in this area. \n\n4. cs.DB (Databases): The paper"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
