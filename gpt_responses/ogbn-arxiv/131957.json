Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves modeling online communities, which can be seen as a social network analysis (SNA) task, making cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SOC (Social and Information Networks) likely sub-categories as well. The paper uses graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which are a type of deep learning model, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper involves developing a new approach for abusive language detection, which can be seen as an artificial intelligence (AI) task, making cs.AI a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
