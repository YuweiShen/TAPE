The paper discusses the use of iterative solvers and convergence guarantees, which are key topics in numerical analysis. \n\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel approach to solving PDEs using deep neural networks, which falls under the umbrella of machine learning. The authors use a neural network to modify the updates of an existing solver, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): While the paper is not specifically focused on computer vision, the use of deep neural networks to solve PDEs is a technique that has been applied in computer vision research. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of iterative solvers and convergence guarantees, which are important topics in control theory. The authors also mention the potential applications of their approach in control systems. \n\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new approach to solving PDEs using deep neural networks, which falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence.
