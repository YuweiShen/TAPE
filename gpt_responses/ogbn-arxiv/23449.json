This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the operating region boundary and the roll-off factor, which are related to network infrastructure (cs.NI) and system theory (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper proposes low-complexity techniques, which could be related to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
