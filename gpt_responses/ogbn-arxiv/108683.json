This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), social and information networks (cs.SI), and computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper uses Fano's inequality and ensembles of graphs to obtain lower bounds on the sample complexity, which are techniques commonly used in these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
