The paper also introduces an improved heuristic for the search algorithms, which involves optimization and decision making (cs.DM). The use of a sparse representation for storing optimal parent choices suggests a focus on information theory (cs.IT) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the empirical results and evaluation of the algorithms suggest a possible sub-category of statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
