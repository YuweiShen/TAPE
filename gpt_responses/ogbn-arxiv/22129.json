The paper proposes a novel approach for addressing summarizability issues in multidimensional data models, which involves processing queries and detecting issues at query time. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), as these fields often deal with query processing and optimization. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of XML data models, which may relate to the field of data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents experimental results that suggest better scalability compared to a reference approach, which may relate to the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
