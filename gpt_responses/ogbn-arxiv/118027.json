The use of convex relaxation and optimization algorithms also suggests that the paper could belong to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. The focus on MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems and interference channels suggests that the paper could also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) and Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories.
