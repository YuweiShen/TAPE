The development of a robust autopilot system for UAVs involves control systems (cs.SY) and cyber-physical systems (cs.CY). Finally, the validation of the system under malicious attack conditions involves neural networks (cs.NE) as the biometric system is based on EEG signals."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
