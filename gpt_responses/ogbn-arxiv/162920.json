The paper also discusses joint transceiver design and interference cancellation, which are relevant to networked communication (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of multiple antennas is a key aspect of the paper, which is also relevant to wireless communication (cs.CE) and multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
