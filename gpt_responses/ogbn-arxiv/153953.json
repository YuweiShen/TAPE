The method uses Bayesian best-arm identification algorithms and individual-based epidemiological models to determine the best strategy to curve epidemic spread. This involves machine learning and optimization techniques, which are commonly associated with the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the use of statistical inference and decision-making, which are associated with the sub-categories of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
