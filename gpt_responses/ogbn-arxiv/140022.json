The proposed method involves generating via-points and path primitives, which can be considered as a form of sampling-based planning (cs.AI). The paper also discusses encoding topological information and performing graph search, which are related to graph theory (cs.GR) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
