Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also uses stochastic geometry to model the network, which falls under the sub-category cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper explores the relationship between mean orientation error, throughput-maximizing beamwidths, and maximum throughput, which involves mathematical analysis and optimization, and could be categorized under cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper mentions radiation patterns of varied complexity, which could be related to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
