The proposed method uses attention to dynamically aggregate multiple parallel convolution kernels, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also discusses the computational efficiency of the method, which is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) research. Finally, the paper presents experimental results on image classification and keypoint detection, which are tasks commonly studied in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
