This involves the use of random Fourier features to generate approximations of the kernel, which are then optimized using gradient-based learning. The paper is likely to be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning), as it deals with the development of a learning methodology for kernel machines. It is also likely to be classified under cs.CV (Computer Vision), as the methodology is applied to object recognition. Additionally, the paper may be classified under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as it deals with the development of a methodology for intelligent systems. It may also be classified under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), as the methodology involves the use of neural networks. Finally, it may be classified under cs.SD (Software Development), as the methodology involves the development of software for large-scale kernel machines."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
