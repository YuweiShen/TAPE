The focus on car-like robots suggests that the paper may also be relevant to control systems (cs.SY). The use of optimization techniques and heuristics for trajectory smoothing and speed optimization suggests that the paper may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) if the robots are equipped with sensors for perception and localization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
