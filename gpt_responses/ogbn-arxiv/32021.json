The paper also discusses the use of regularization, which is a common technique in machine learning and statistics. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with statistical inference and estimation. The paper also discusses the robustness of the estimators, which is a topic that falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses asymptotic regimes, which is a topic that falls under the category of statistics (cs.ST). The paper also discusses numerical methods for computing the estimators, which is a topic that falls under the category of numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper discusses the theoretical properties of the estimators, which is a topic that falls under the category of theoretical computer science (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
