This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and specifically deals with computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the impact of training strategies and hyperparameters on the sparsity, which is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
