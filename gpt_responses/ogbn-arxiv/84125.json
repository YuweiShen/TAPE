The paper proposes new estimators for OPE based on empirical likelihood, which is a statistical method. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) since they are closely related to machine learning. The paper also discusses various properties of existing estimators, which could fall under cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) or cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
