The paper also proposes a new sample selection method for training the network, which involves a trade-off between exploitation and exploration, and uses a new policy called Relaxed Upper Confident Bound (RUCB). This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with medical imaging, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a new method for sample selection, which involves a probabilistic approach, suggesting that it may also be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
