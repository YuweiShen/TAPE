This involves the use of deep neural networks for multitask learning to classify high and low cognitive load, as well as expert and novice participants. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), which deals with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use. \n\nThe paper also involves the development of a deep neural network for multitask learning, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the use of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for classification may fall under the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), which deals with the study of neural networks and their applications. Finally, the paper involves the development of a framework for adaptive simulation, which may fall under the sub-category of cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity and Privacy)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
