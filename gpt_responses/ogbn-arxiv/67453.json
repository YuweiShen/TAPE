The paper also mentions the robustness and security of the proposed algorithm. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed algorithm uses three neural networks and adversarial training, which are machine learning techniques. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of neural networks and adversarial training also falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.SD (Sound): The paper specifically deals with audio steganography, which is a subfield of sound."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
