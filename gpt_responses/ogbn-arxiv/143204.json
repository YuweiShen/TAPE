This involves optimizing the network throughput and base station association, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the mathematical framework used to characterize the performance gain of spectrum sharing, which involves optimizing the beamforming and bandwidth allocation. This falls under the scope of information theory. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper specifically focuses on mmWave networks, which are used for high-speed multimedia applications. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the need for coordination among different cellular operators in spectrum sharing, which falls under the scope of systems and control. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society) - The paper does not directly relate to computers and society, but it is possible that the results of this research could have implications for spectrum policy and regulation, which falls under the scope of computers and society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
