The paper also mentions the use of facial landmark heatmaps and parsing maps, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. Additionally, the paper proposes a new evaluation metric for face SR, which further supports its classification under cs.CV. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of deep learning techniques, which makes it likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. \n\nFurthermore, the paper deals with image processing and generation, which could classify it under the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper proposes a new evaluation metric, which could classify it under the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
