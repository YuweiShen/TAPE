It may also belong to Multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with video processing. Graphics (cs.GR) is another possible sub-category as it involves image and video rendering. Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Information Retrieval (cs.IR) are also possible sub-categories as the paper involves fitting local polynomial approximations to observed sensor data, which could be seen as a form of machine learning, and the output mapping could be seen as a form of information retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
