The second part of the paper also deals with planning under uncertainty and learning optimal action-selection behavior, which are topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of sensors to provide a noisy description of the surrounding environment suggests computer vision (cs.CV) may also be relevant. The paper also mentions the need for agents to update their current image of the world, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the formalization of agent/environment interactions as embedded systems with stochastic dynamics suggests control systems (cs.SY) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
