The sequences have optimal autocorrelation magnitude, which is a property relevant to cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the linear complexity and 2-adic complexity of the sequences, which are concepts in discrete mathematics and computer science (cs.DS). The sequences may have applications in signal processing and communication systems, which fall under the sub-categories of cs.SI and cs.NI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
