The paper also proposes a new approach that does not require modification of the segmentation training procedure, which suggests that it may be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also involves designing input labels and improving weakly supervised results, which are topics that fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with semantic labelling, which is a topic that falls under the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves image processing, which is a topic that falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
