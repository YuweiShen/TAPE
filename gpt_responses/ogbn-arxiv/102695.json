It also involves the use of multiple antennas at each node, which is a topic of interest in the field of networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses interference management techniques, which is a topic of research in the field of signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper involves the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which is a topic of research in the field of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the system in terms of degrees of freedom, which is a topic of research in the field of computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
