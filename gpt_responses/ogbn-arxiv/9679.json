This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) domains. The proposed method involves the use of a new loss function to guide the network, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve the evaluation of the network's performance, which is a common practice in machine learning (cs.MS) and multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
