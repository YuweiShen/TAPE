It also involves the use of deep learning techniques such as PCAnet and kPCA, which are commonly used in computer vision research. Additionally, the paper may also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories due to the use of self-supervised learning and one-class classification techniques. Multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) categories are also possible as the paper deals with video surveillance and anomaly detection, which are relevant to these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
