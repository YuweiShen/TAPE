The paper details a typing discipline for a core programming language blending concurrent objects, asynchronous message passing, and join patterns. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a technique to help developers in the implementation and use of mutable objects whose public interface depends on their private state. The proposed approach is fully compositional and scalable, and the static analysis technique described in the paper can be used to certify programs written in a core language for concurrent TSOP with proven correctness guarantees. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper focuses on concurrent objects and proposes a refinement of TSOP for concurrent objects that guarantees deadlock freedom. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses behavioral types and dependency relations to specify and enforce object protocols and detect circularities that might cause deadlocks. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a technique to detect circularities that might cause deadlocks in concurrent objects, which can be seen as a problem related to data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
