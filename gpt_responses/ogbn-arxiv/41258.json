Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves mathematical proofs and simulations, which suggest that it could belong to cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The use of QPPs and distance spectrum also suggests that it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
