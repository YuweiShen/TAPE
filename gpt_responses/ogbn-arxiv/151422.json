Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves text analysis and classification, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). The use of SVM classifier for identification suggests the involvement of cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with forensic investigation, which could be related to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
