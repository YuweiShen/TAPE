The paper also addresses issues related to software engineering (cs.SE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in the context of robotics. The proposed approach involves introducing high-level abstractions, which can be seen as a system-level approach to robotics (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the approach using different sensors, which could fall under the category of machine learning and robotics (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
