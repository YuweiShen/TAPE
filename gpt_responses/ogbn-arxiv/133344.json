The approach proposed involves optimizing the trade-off between information leakage and performance overhead, which is a problem that is often encountered in software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also discusses the use of specific optimization techniques, such as mixed integer-linear programming, which are commonly used in programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). The problem of minimizing information leaks can also be viewed as a problem in data structures (cs.DS), as it involves managing and manipulating information in a way that minimizes the risk of unauthorized access. Finally, the paper uses entropy-based objectives to measure the strength of the side channels, which is a topic that is closely related to machine learning and information theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
