It discusses the operational and denotational semantics of the calculus and demonstrates its expressiveness by showing the definability of solutions to Rutten's behavioural differential equations. The paper also introduces a program logic for reasoning about the contextual equivalence of programs. Based on these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO), Programming Languages (cs.PL), and Theoretical Computer Science (cs.TL). Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL) and Software Engineering (cs.SE) are also possible categories, as the paper discusses the productivity of well-typed programs and introduces a program logic for reasoning about program equivalence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
