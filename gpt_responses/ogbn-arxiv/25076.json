The system aims to empower communities to advocate for better air quality, which is a social issue. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The system developed in this paper relies on community members to report odors, which creates a social network of citizen scientists. The paper also discusses the use of push notifications to inform communities, which can be seen as a form of social influence. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The system developed in this paper is designed to be accessible to community members, which requires a focus on human-computer interaction. The paper also discusses the use of push notifications to engage users, which is a common technique in HCI. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the development of a model to predict upcoming smell events, which can be seen as a form of computational science. The paper also applies regression analysis to identify statistically significant effects of push notifications on user engagement, which is a common technique in computational engineering. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the visualization of smell report data and air quality data on a map, which can be seen as a form of information retrieval"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
