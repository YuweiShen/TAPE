Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) since the proposed method can be applied to various tasks such as image classification and object detection. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of neural networks for feature extraction and end-to-end processing, indicating relevance to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
