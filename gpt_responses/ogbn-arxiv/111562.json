The experiments are conducted on image classification (cs.CV) and semantic segmentation (cs.CL) tasks, which further support these categories. The paper also discusses the role of exponentiation in boosting gradients, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
