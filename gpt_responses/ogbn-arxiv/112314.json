The approach utilizes fine-grained spatial data and a wide-and-deep learning approach, which are commonly used in computer vision and machine learning (cs.CV, cs.LG). The paper also mentions predicting distributions rather than single point values, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the utility of the approach for sports analysis, which could fall under the sub-categories of social and information sciences (cs.SI) or systems and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
