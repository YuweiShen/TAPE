It also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it proposes a novel measure of population-wide diversity. The paper also involves robotics (cs.RO) as it discusses the impact of diversity on exploration in reinforcement learning. Additionally, it involves systems and control (cs.SY) as it proposes a method for adapting to the degree of diversity during training. Finally, it involves neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) as it discusses the use of behavioral embeddings in the proposed approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
