The proposed method involves deep learning architectures and similarity mining, which are common techniques in CV and ML. Therefore, cs.CV and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also deals with information retrieval (IR) and multimedia (MM) tasks, which are related to hashing. Finally, the paper involves transfer learning and knowledge transfer, which are common topics in artificial intelligence (AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
