The use of randomized sampling methods and Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques also suggests a possible fit under the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a novel receiver architecture for multiuser MIMO systems, which could potentially fall under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) or multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of the proposed receiver architecture in frequency selective fading channels, which could also suggest a possible fit under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
