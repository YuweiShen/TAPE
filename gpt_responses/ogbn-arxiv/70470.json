The use of local subgraphs and embedding techniques also suggests a connection to graph theory (cs.DS) and graph algorithms (cs.GT). Additionally, the paper's focus on recognition and algorithms suggests a possible connection to computational complexity and algorithms (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
