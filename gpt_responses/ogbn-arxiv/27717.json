The paper proposes an active LFA mitigation mechanism called Linkbait that uses a link obfuscation algorithm to selectively reroute probing flows to hide target links from adversaries and mislead them to identify bait links as target links. This mechanism falls under the category of cybersecurity (cs.CR) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of support vector machine (SVM) for identifying attack traffic, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper proposes a compromised IoT devices detection algorithm, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and systems and control (cs.SY). Therefore, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CR, cs.NI, cs.SY, cs.AI, and cs.DC, ordered from most to least likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
