The paper also makes use of information theory results to derive the minimum amount of control information that must be exchanged, which suggests that it could also belong to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also mentions an alternating optimization framework, which is a common technique in the field of optimization and could place it in the multi-agent systems (cs.MA) sub-category. The paper also deals with wireless resource allocation, which suggests that it could belong to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses design tradeoffs, which could place it in the game theory (cs.GT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
