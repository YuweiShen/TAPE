The algorithm is designed to improve the performance of label propagation on various practical data and to address the labeling difficulties of different examples. The paper focuses on machine learning and artificial intelligence, specifically on the subfields of learning algorithms (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), computational linguistics (cs.CL), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
