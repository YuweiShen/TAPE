The paper also mentions the use of learning rate decay in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) tasks, which suggests that these sub-categories are also relevant. Finally, the paper proposes a novel explanation for the effectiveness of learning rate decay, which could be of interest to researchers in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
