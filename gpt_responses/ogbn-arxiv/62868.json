Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses the design of custom cells and the handling of interconnects, which falls under cs.DC (Design Automation and VLSI), cs.ET (Emerging Technologies), and cs.AR (Architecture). Finally, the paper addresses the cost implications of split manufacturing, which relates to cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
