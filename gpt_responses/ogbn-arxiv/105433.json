Additionally, the proposal for designing autonomous systems to identify themselves at the start of any interaction relates to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also touches on the potential risks and security concerns of mistaken identity, which could fall under the categories of robotics (cs.RO) and cybersecurity (cs.CR). Finally, the proposal for designing autonomous systems to be easily distinguishable from humans could also relate to social and information sciences (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
