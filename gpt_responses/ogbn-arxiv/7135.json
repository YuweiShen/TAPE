The proposed method involves a semi-supervised self-taught deep learning framework, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The study also involves medical imaging, which could place it under the sub-category of medical imaging (cs.MED).
