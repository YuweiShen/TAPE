The proposed sensor scheduling policies also involve learning and optimization, which are topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and mathematical optimization (cs.MA). Finally, the paper discusses the tradeoffs and performance of the proposed policies in a system with multiple components, which is a topic in systems engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
