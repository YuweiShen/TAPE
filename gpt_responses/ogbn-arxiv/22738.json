The use of kernel methods in computer vision (cs.CV) is also mentioned in the abstract. The paper proposes a novel sampling strategy based on statistical leverage scores, which is a statistical concept relevant to data analysis (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which suggests a focus on practical applications and systems (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
