It also involves the use of Tanner graphs, which are commonly used in coding theory and graph theory (cs.DS). The paper presents new upper bounds on stopping redundancy, which could be of interest to researchers working on error-correcting codes and their applications (cs.SI). The use of combinatorial quantities such as Turan numbers suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper does not seem to involve any specific algorithms or computational techniques, so it is less likely to belong to categories such as cs.CC (computational complexity) or cs.DA (data structures and algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
