The paper also mentions the difficulty in explaining the decisions made by neural networks, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of neural networks for image classification is also mentioned, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the hierarchical nature of neural networks, which is a topic in neural engineering (cs.NE).
