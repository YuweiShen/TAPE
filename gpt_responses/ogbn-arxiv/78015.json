This falls under the category of machine learning and specifically, the subfield of deep learning. The paper proposes a modification to the traditional NP loss function using approximations of Wasserstein distance, which is a concept from optimal transport theory. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfields of optimization and mathematical modeling. Therefore, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
