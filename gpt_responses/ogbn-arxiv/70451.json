The use of nested lattice codebooks and quantization techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the signal processing (cs.MM) sub-category. The application of Integer-Forcing, a technique based on compute-and-forward, indicates that the paper may also be relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. The use of judiciously chosen integer linear combinations of quantized signals suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the proposal and analysis of a one-shot version of IF source coding suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
