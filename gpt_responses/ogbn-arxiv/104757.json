Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of neural networks, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper proposes different mechanisms for sharing information, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The experiments involve benchmark text classification tasks, which could also place the paper under cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper uses a neural network to jointly learn across multiple tasks, which could also fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
