The paper focuses on improving the system-wide spectral efficiency (SE) by applying cell range expansion (CRE) and inter-cell interference coordination (eICIC and FeICIC). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with system design and optimization, which falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of UAVs, which can be categorized under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
