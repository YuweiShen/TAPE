This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The paper also introduces a method for learning inter-task relatedness, which falls under the umbrella of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on classification, regression, and ranking tasks, which are common in natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
