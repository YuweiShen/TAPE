The use of attentional convolutional network also suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The datasets used in the experiments involve images and videos, indicating the involvement of multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the importance of understanding human emotions, which falls under human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
