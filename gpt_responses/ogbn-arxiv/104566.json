The proposed protocol involves user cooperation and scheduling, which are also relevant to system and control theory (cs.SY). The use of batched network code suggests a potential application in multimedia communication (cs.MM). Finally, the analysis and simulation of the protocol's performance may involve distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
