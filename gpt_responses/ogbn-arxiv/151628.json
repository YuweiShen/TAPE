Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves machine learning techniques, such as joint training, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions utilizing relationships among target categories, which could indicate it belongs to cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the paper involves experiments on datasets, which could suggest it belongs to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
