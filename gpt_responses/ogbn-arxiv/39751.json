Additionally, the paper discusses the use of neural networks and neural architecture search, which are common topics in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of parameter remapping, which is a technique commonly used in the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency of the proposed method, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category, as efficiency is an important consideration in robotics applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
