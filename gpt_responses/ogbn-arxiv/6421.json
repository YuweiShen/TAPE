This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision sub-category.\n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper proposes a method for estimating the ego-motion of cameras and inter-camera poses, which are relevant to robotics applications such as visual odometry and SLAM.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a PoseNet-based network to estimate ego-motion, which is a machine learning technique. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an automated method for camera calibration, which is a task that can be automated using AI techniques.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an on-line method for inter-camera pose estimation, which is relevant to systems and control applications such as real-time tracking and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
