The paper also mentions regular functions and transductions, which are topics related to formal languages and automata theory, respectively. Therefore, the paper could also be classified under the sub-categories of programming languages (cs.PL), formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
