This is a core topic in game theory and hence, cs.GT is the most likely sub-category. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a dynamic program to determine the equilibria of dynamic games with asymmetric information. This involves decision-making and optimization, which are key topics in AI. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses a class of equilibria for dynamic games with asymmetric information, which can be seen as a learning problem. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents a sequential decomposition of dynamic games with asymmetric information over time, which can be seen as an algorithmic approach to solving such games. \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with asymmetric information and proposes a way to compress agents' information in a mutually consistent manner. This involves information theory concepts such as compression and mutual consistency."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
