Other likely categories could be cs.LG, cs.SI, cs.SY, and eess.AS. cs.LG because the paper uses a neural network for joint representation of spectra, cs.SI because the paper deals with simultaneous reduction of multiple sources of distortion, cs.SY because the paper proposes an iterative block-coordinate ascent algorithm for updating filters, and eess.AS because the paper deals with audio signal processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
