Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the analysis of the constructed spanner, which involves results on plane geometry, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper deals with the performance of the constructed spanner, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
