The paper discusses the development of a receiver capable of detecting the network-coded combination of bits during a slot considering an arbitrary number of sources, orthogonal modulation, and a block fading channel. This work involves the application of information theory (cs.IT) and networking (cs.NI) concepts. The use of sphere decoding to reduce complexity is a signal processing technique (cs.SI). The simulation and analysis of the system performance involve the use of mathematical models and algorithms (cs.MM) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
