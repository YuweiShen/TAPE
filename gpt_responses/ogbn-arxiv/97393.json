This suggests that cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of an oracle and hashing, which are common techniques in data structures (cs.DS) and scientific computing (cs.SC). The application of the algorithm to implicitization of parametric hypersurfaces suggests that it may also be relevant to control systems (cs.SY) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
