The paper proposes a new type of attack called elite Sybil attacks, which recruit highly-rated accounts to generate realistic-looking reviews. This type of attack is likely to fall under the categories of security and privacy (cs.CR), social and information networks (cs.SI), and social computing (cs.SOC).
