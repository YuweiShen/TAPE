The paper proposes a control strategy for executing coordinated trajectories computed by a multi-robot trajectory planner, which involves designing a safe and deadlock-free approach (cs.MA, cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of reactive collision-avoidance methods and compares the proposed approach to state-of-the-art reactive techniques, which are topics commonly studied in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
