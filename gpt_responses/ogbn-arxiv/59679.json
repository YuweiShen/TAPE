It also discusses the use of edge processing and Neural Processing Unit (NPU) in mobile, which falls under the categories of multimedia (MM) and neural networks (NE). Additionally, the paper proposes heuristics based solutions for integer programming problems, which relates to the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (DC). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.MM, cs.NE, and cs.DC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
