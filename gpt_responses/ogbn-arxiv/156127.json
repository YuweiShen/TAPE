The framework also involves the specification of different sets of assumptions and objectives, which is related to the field of Robotics (cs.RO) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also borrows from work in Software Engineering (cs.SE) to propose the multi-tier framework. Finally, the paper discusses the need for planning systems supporting dual fairness assumptions, which is related to the field of Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
