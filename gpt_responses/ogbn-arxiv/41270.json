The use of algebraic constructions and left regular matrix representations suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). The focus on low ML decoding complexity and the use of lattice decoder algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The use of algebraic constructions and the mention of full diversity suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the mention of low Peak to Average Power Ratio suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
