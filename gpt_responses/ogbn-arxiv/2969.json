It also mentions the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, which are commonly used in computer vision research. \n\nThe paper also discusses the learning behavior of deep residual networks, which suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. \n\nThe use of ensembles in deep residual networks could also make it relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. \n\nThe proposed model architecture and its performance improvements could also make it relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper mentions investigating a model parallelism technique, which could make it relevant to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category, as parallel computing is often used in large-scale language processing tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
