The paper also introduces a new notion of capacity based on Information Geometry, which is related to information theory (cs.IT). The experiments conducted in the paper are on image classification tasks, which is a common application of computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses the generalization error of the proposed measure, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE) and statistical learning theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
