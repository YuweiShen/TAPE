This involves analyzing and visualizing the main paths of diversification, which suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and social networks (cs.SI). Additionally, the use of technology maps and filtering techniques may fall under the categories of software engineering (cs.SE), data mining (cs.DM), and cybernetics (cs.CY). Finally, the paper may also touch on topics related to machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL) in the context of analyzing patent data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
