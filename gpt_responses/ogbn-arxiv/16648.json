The robots are equipped with lights, which is a characteristic of the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The Look-Compute-Move cycles and fully asynchronous scheduler are typical features of the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The problem of forming arbitrary patterns is related to the Distributed Data Structures (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the study of initial configurations for forming arbitrary patterns can be seen as a problem of Control Systems (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
