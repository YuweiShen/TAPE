The paper introduces a new and computationally efficient 4D light field feature detector and descriptor, which is particularly useful for structure from motion (SfM) and other tasks that match features across viewpoints of a scene. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with 3D reconstructions and depth estimation, which are also relevant to the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. The use of light field cameras suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category, as these cameras are often used in robotics applications. The paper's focus on efficiency suggests that it may also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category, which deals with efficient processing and representation of multimedia data. Finally, the paper's use of feature detection and descriptors suggests that it may be relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category, which deals with machine learning and computer vision techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
