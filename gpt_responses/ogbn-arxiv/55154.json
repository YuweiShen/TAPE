However, given the focus on wireless communication and signal processing, Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) are the most likely categories. The paper also discusses the optimization of beamformers, which is a topic that falls under Systems and Control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of numerical simulations, which could place it under Multimedia (cs.MM) or Computer Networks and Communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
