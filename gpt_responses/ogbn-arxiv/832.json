The paper proposes a method for estimating a mapping from observations to latent states and constructing good exploration policies. This falls under the broad category of machine learning and specifically RL, which suggests cs.LG and cs.AI as likely categories. The paper also deals with robotics and control, which suggests cs.RO as a likely category. The paper uses clustering and regression techniques, which suggests cs.CL as a possible category. Finally, the paper provides theoretical guarantees, which suggests cs.SY as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
