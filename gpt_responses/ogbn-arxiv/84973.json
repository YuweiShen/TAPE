The proposed method is based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), which are a popular tool in both communities. The paper also discusses the properties of SVMs in the open-set scenario, which is a topic of interest in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) communities. Finally, the paper presents experimental results on image datasets, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
