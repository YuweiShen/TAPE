This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as well as systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also presents computationally efficient algorithms to solve the optimization problem, which involves mixed-integer linear programming, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI).
