Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also deals with resource allocation and optimization, which falls under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of erasure codes for mixing data in sub-tasks is related to cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper presents experimental results and performance analysis, which are typical of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
