It also involves the study of formations, which are related to combinatorial designs and graph theory, making cs.CC and cs.GT likely sub-categories as well. The use of upper bounds and analysis of algorithms suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
