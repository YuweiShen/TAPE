The use of models of human decision-making from behavioral psychology, behavioral economics, and neuroscience suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfields of cognitive science and neuroscience. The examples used in the paper involve grid worlds and ride-sharing, which are relevant to the subfields of robotics and control engineering. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.CE (Control Engineering), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
