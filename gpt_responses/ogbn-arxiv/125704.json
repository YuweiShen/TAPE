Additionally, the paper discusses the complexity of producing $N \\times N$ squares, which could also place it in the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity) sub-categories. The use of tile assembly models also suggests a potential fit for the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. Finally, the paper includes results on the efficient self-assembly of squares, which could place it in the cs.CG (Computational Geometry) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
