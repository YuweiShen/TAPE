The proposed method is based on $M$-estimation, which is a statistical estimation technique that is often used in machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the performance of the method under non-Gaussian noise conditions, which is a topic in statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
