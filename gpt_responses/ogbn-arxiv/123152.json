Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with wireless communication systems, which suggests cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as another likely category. The paper proposes an adaptive algorithm for channel estimation, which involves system control and optimization, indicating cs.SY (Systems and Control) as a possible category. The paper also deals with mm-Wave frequencies and beamforming, which suggests cs.MM (Multimedia) as another possible category. Finally, the paper applies the theory of optimal design of experiments in statistics, indicating cs.LG (Machine Learning) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
