This falls under the scope of neural computing and makes cs.NE the most likely category.\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - The paper deals with language prediction tasks and character-level prediction, which falls under the scope of natural language processing. This makes cs.CL a likely category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper deals with improving the performance of recurrent neural networks, which is a core topic in machine learning. This makes cs.LG a likely category.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper deals with improving the performance of neural networks, which is a core topic in artificial intelligence. This makes cs.AI a likely category.\n5. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - Although the paper does not explicitly deal with computer vision, the techniques used in the paper could be applied to image and video data, which falls under the scope of computer vision.
