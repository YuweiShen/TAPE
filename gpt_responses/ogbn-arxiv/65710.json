The proposed group pyramid pooling module and the use of a new dataset also suggest a focus on machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG) techniques. Additionally, the use of annotations and the evaluation metrics suggest a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
