The use of coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission suggests a focus on networking and communication (cs.NI), while the consideration of channel connectivity and transmit set selection suggests a focus on signal processing and optimization (cs.SI). The mention of backhaul links and message distribution suggests a focus on mobile and wireless communication (cs.MM), while the consideration of cooperation constraints suggests a focus on distributed systems and algorithms (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
