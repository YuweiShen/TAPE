This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also presents a new algorithm for preventing these attacks, which involves canonicalizing user-supplied path strings. This algorithm is related to programming languages (cs.PL) and systems and control (cs.SY), as it involves cross-platform compatibility and verification strategies using symbolic execution. Finally, the paper also mentions the goal of the algorithm being small and easy to test, which relates to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
