The paper also discusses the use of different sampling methods, including irregular nonuniform sampling, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SP) and machine learning (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the use of filter-bank sampling, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SP). The paper's results may have implications for the design of communication systems, which is a topic in systems and control (cs.SI). Finally, the paper's focus on capacity limits and optimization suggests a connection to optimization and learning theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
