The experiments are conducted on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification (cs.CV), and the method is also shown to work for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the impact of sparsity on prediction accuracy and inference cost, which are important considerations in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of the method for natural language processing tasks, which falls under the category of \"Computation and Language\" (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
