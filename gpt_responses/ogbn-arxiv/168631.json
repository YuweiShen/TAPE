The paper also proposes a new representation of types as hyper-rectangular regions, which falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG). The evaluation protocols discussed in the paper involve measuring the accuracy of transitive relation inference, which is relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL), databases (cs.DB), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
