The paper proposes an algorithm that uses cost-to-come information to focus the search, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.AI) and optimization (cs.LG). The algorithm can be applied to a variety of cost maps, which includes systems and control (cs.SY) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
