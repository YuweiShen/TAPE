The paper also introduces a novel bipartite graph representation for modeling sparse signal ensembles, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and possibly multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper provides fundamental bounds on the number of measurements required for joint signal recovery, which could be considered a statistical inference problem (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
