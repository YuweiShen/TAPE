The paper proposes a novel learning algorithm called other-play (OP) that enhances self-play, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods, which is a subfield of machine learning that deals with multiple agents interacting with each other (cs.MA). The paper studies the cooperative card game Hanabi, which is a problem in game theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper also discusses the performance of the proposed algorithm when paired with human players, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
