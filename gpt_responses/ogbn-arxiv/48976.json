The proposed approach uses Bayesian learning, which is a well-established strategy for hard problems in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of prior distributions and optimization in both continuous and discrete spaces, which are common topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the experiments are conducted on image datasets, which is a common application area for multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
