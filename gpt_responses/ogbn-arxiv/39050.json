Additionally, the paper proposes a new deep learning framework (FlexFlow) that uses guided randomized search to find a fast parallelization strategy, which could also fall under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the use of SOAP, a more comprehensive search space for parallelization strategies, which could fall under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach with real-world DNN benchmarks, which could fall under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
