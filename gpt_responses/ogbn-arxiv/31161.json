This topic is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG), as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper focuses on the application of road sign classification in the context of autonomous driving, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
