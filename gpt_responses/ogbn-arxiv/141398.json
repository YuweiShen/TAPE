Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper proposes a new architecture that uses region adaptive dense deformable modules and a self-attentive module, which are machine learning techniques. Therefore, the paper could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions benchmark datasets for dynamic scene deblurring, which suggests that it could belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
