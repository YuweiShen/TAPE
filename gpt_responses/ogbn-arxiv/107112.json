The use of a robotic platform and manipulation tasks make this category the most likely.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of tactile feedback for control, which is a common topic in AI research. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a tactile-based state estimator, which is a common AI technique.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions the use of efficient planners, which could potentially involve machine learning techniques. Additionally, the use of a tactile-based state estimator could also involve machine learning.\n4. cs.CV (Computer Vision): Although the paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, the use of tactile feedback for control could potentially involve computer vision techniques for interpreting tactile information.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the control of contact states and object states, which are common topics in systems and control research. Additionally, the use of closed-loop controllers is a common technique in this field."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
