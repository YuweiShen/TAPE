The method is applicable to networks with differentiable and non-differentiable activation functions, which suggests a focus on computer vision tasks (cs.CV) where ReLU activation functions are commonly used. The paper also mentions the use of quasi-convexity, which is a mathematical optimization technique that could fall under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
