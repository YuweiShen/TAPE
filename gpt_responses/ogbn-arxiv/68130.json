The paper also mentions direct visual odometry (DVO), which is a technique used in robotics (cs.RO) for estimating the motion of a robot using visual input. The use of unsupervised learning strategies (cs.LG) and novel depth normalization strategies (cs.AI) are also mentioned in the paper. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it deals with generating 3D depth maps from 2D images."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
