The use of annotations and their applications to computing optimal homologous cycles suggest that the paper may also belong to sub-categories related to data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The mention of surfaces and the extension of an algorithm to arbitrary 2-complexes suggest that the paper may also belong to sub-categories related to graph theory (cs.GT) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
