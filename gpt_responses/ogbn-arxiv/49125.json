The paper also mentions computer vision (cs.CV) as an application area for their proposed method. Additionally, the use of neural networks suggests that the paper may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the architecture (cs.AR) category as it discusses the deployment of models on different inference accelerators."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
