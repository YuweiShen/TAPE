Therefore, cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the study of book drawings, which is a subfield of computational geometry, making cs.CG (Computational Geometry) another likely sub-category. The use of fixed parameter tractable algorithms suggests that the paper may also fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Finally, the study of crossing numbers and graph embeddings may also make cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
