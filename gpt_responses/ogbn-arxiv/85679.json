The proposed method involves using deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) based classifiers fine-tuned with a dataset of real and fake hand representations captured in both visible and thermal spectrum. This involves image processing and analysis, which falls under the domain of computer vision. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper deals with presentation attack detection (PAD) in hand biometrics, which is a security-related problem. The proposed method aims to detect fake hand representations, which can be used to bypass the biometric system's security measures. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the use of thermal features of the hand for presentation attack detection in a hand biometrics system's pipeline. This involves the use of multiple modalities (visible and thermal spectrum) for capturing hand representations, which can be considered as multimedia data. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed method involves using deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) based classifiers fine-tuned with a dataset of real and fake hand representations. This involves the use of machine learning techniques for classification. \n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper deals with the use of hand biometrics for user authentication."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
