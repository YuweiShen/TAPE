The use of neural networks for learning the mapping from perception to decision suggests that the paper may also fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of 2D-laser range findings and target positions suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) may also be relevant. Finally, the fact that the model is able to navigate in real-world environments suggests that the paper may also fall under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
