Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SP (Signal Processing) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves polynomial interpolation, which falls under numerical analysis (cs.NA). The use of sparse signals and the polynomial interpolation aspect suggest that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
