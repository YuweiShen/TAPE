The use of optimization methods to predict muscle forces for measured movements is also a common approach in robotics. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses deep autoencoders, which are a type of neural network, to predict muscle activation trajectories. \n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision): Although the paper does not explicitly deal with computer vision, the use of neural networks for prediction is a common approach in computer vision. \n4. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses neural networks for prediction, which falls under the scope of this sub-category. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with the problem of motor control, which is a common problem in AI.
