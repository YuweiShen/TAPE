This falls under the domain of robotics. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper uses monocular cameras for feature detection and tracking, which is a computer vision technique. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the communication and coordination between multiple MAVs, which falls under the domain of systems and control. \n4. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper presents a collaborative localization approach for multiple agents (MAVs) working together towards a common goal. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses multiple-view geometry based relative pose computation, which is a technique used in computer vision and artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
