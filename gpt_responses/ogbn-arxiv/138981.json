The paper proposes a unified method for testing closeness of a wide range of univariate structured distribution families, which suggests that it could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also provides lower bounds and optimal algorithms for the problem, which suggests that it could belong to the Data Structures (cs.DS), Learning (cs.LG), or Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the sample complexity of the proposed algorithm, which suggests that it could belong to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
