The focus of the paper is on handling noise in the input data, which is a common issue in real-world applications. The paper proposes a new method called t-Exponential Triplet Embedding (t-ETE) that is inspired by recent advances in robust binary classification and ranking. The paper presents extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
