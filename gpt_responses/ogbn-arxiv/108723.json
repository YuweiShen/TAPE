This involves the use of binaural spectral features extracted from a microphone pair and a supervised audio-visual alignment technique that maps these features onto an image. The paper also introduces a novel dataset that contains audio-visual training data as well as scenarios involving several participants engaged in formal and informal dialogue. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are Speech and Dialogue Processing (cs.SD), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Computation and Language (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
