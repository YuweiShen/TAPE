Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of data structures and algorithms, which suggests that it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The use of deterministic and expected time algorithms suggests that it could belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
