This involves building a denotational semantics and using assume-guarantee reasoning. These concepts are commonly associated with programming languages and software engineering (cs.PL, cs.SE). The paper also mentions avoiding combinatorial explosion, which is a common concern in logic (cs.LO) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses implementation of prototype tools, which falls under systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
