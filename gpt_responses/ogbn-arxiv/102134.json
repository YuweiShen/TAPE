The use of spatial coupling techniques also suggests a possible fit with the Networked and Distributed Systems (cs.NI) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the study of the constraint length of LDPC codes is related to the field of Coding and Information Theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
