The framework also involves real-time colored volumetric mapping, which could be related to computer vision (cs.CV). The use of explicit representation of all three states in the map and the methods for faster insertions could involve artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The framework's integration into ROS (Robot Operating System) could also relate to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
