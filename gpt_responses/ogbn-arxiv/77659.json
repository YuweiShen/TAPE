It proposes a new aggregation rule that is provably resilient to Byzantine failures. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper is about distributed learning and proposes a new aggregation rule that is designed to work in a distributed setting. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new algorithm for aggregating the results of SGD in a distributed setting. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the problem of controlling distributed systems in the presence of Byzantine failures, which is a problem in systems and control theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
