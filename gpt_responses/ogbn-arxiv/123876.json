The paper also discusses the efficiency of the index in searching and extracting subtexts, which is relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of succinct data structures is also mentioned, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also experiments with real-world repetitive texts, which could fall under the category of natural language processing (cs.DL) or databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
