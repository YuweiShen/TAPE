This involves using voltage and injection measurements at the terminal nodes of the grid to reconstruct the topology and impedances of the operational lines. This problem involves aspects of systems engineering (cs.SY), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), network infrastructure (cs.NI), and computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
