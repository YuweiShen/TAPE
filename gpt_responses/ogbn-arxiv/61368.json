This makes it likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with the challenges of large dimensionality and scarcity of labeled data, which are common issues in information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Finally, the paper proposes a method that requires fewer training samples, which suggests it may also be relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
