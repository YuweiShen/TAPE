This involves optimizing the transmit power of the primary signal and the reflection coefficient of the secondary ambient backscatter to maximize the ergodic capacity of the secondary system under fading channels. This topic is related to information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), systems and control (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves optimizing the performance of a communication system using mathematical models and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
