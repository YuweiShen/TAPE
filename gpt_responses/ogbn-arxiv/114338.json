The proposed solution involves redesigning the JPEG compression framework, which falls under the category of computer graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the limitations of existing mitigation solutions, which relates to the field of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the proposed method involves maximizing the malicious feature loss of AE perturbations, which is a technique commonly used in adversarial attacks and defenses in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
