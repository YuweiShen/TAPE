This involves disentangling pose and appearance features from RGB imagery, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also mentions collecting a new dataset, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories.
