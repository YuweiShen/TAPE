The approach involves integrating molecular structure, transcriptomic profiles, and prior knowledge about interactions among proteins within cells. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computational biology (cs.CE), databases (cs.DB), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
