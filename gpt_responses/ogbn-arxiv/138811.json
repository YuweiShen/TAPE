The task of resolving one-word questions in conversations requires machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI), and the paper presents baseline architectures for the task, which falls under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of crowd-sourcing for dataset annotation, which falls under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI). Additionally, the task of resolving sluices in conversations involves understanding the context and retrieving relevant information, which can be achieved through neural networks and other computational techniques (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
