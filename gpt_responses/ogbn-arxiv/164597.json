This falls under the domain of computer vision and pattern recognition, making cs.CV a likely sub-category. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - As the paper deals with multimodal sentiment analysis, which involves multiple modalities such as text, audio, and video, cs.MM is also a likely sub-category. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper discusses deep learning-based architectures for sentiment analysis, which falls under the domain of machine learning. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper discusses the importance of generalizability in multimodal sentiment analysis, which is a key issue in information retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
