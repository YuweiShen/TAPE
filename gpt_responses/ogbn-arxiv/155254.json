It also involves the study of subshifts, which is a topic in formal languages (cs.FL) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also uses graph theory (cs.GT) to analyze the structure of the subshifts. Finally, the paper discusses the behavior of the dynamical system, which is a topic in control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
