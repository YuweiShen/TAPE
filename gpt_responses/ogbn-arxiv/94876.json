The paper also discusses the use of integrity checks and progressive decoding mechanisms, which are concepts related to Information Theory (cs.IT) and Error-Correcting Codes (cs.CR). The paper specifically addresses the issue of Byzantine failures, which is a topic related to Distributed Systems (cs.DS) and System and Control Theory (cs.SY).
