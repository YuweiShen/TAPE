The proposed method involves quantifying feature map importance and conducting kernel clustering, which are also relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper evaluates the method on image datasets, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
