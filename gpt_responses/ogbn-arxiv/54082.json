Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with data management and database systems, which suggests cs.DB as another likely sub-category. The use of linear and non-linear models for runtime estimation indicates that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of runtime approximation on the overall execution of link specifications, which suggests that it may also be relevant to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
