Additionally, the paper discusses the use of deep learning methods, which falls under the deep learning (cs.DL) sub-category. The paper also touches on issues related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and information retrieval (cs.IR) as it discusses the use of weakly-supervised data-driven techniques to perform scalable historical analysis of large image corpora. Finally, the paper discusses trends in fashion and social norms over time, which suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
