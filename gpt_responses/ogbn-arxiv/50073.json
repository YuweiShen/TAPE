The proposed method also involves the use of unitary matrices, which is a topic in linear algebra and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of beamforming to minimize inter-user interference, which is a topic in networking and communications (cs.NI). Finally, the paper proposes a new decomposition method, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
