Additionally, the use of sequence to sequence models and gated recurrent units are common techniques in NLP research. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a new model architecture for the encoder-decoder setting. \n\nArtificial Intelligence (cs.AI) is another likely sub-category as the paper deals with improving the ability of seq2seq models to capture compositionalities better. \n\nInformation Retrieval (cs.IR) is a possible sub-category as summarization is a common task in IR research. \n\nFinally, Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) is a possible sub-category as the proposed model uses gated recurrent units, which are a type of neural network architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
