This is a common problem in machine learning, and the proposed solution is likely to be of interest to researchers in several subfields. The use of gradient-based training suggests that the paper is likely to be in the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) subcategories. The focus on end-to-end learning and the use of neural networks suggests that deep learning (cs.DL) is also a likely subcategory. The specific applications of the proposed method to financial prediction tasks suggest that computational finance (cs.CE) and computer security (cs.CR) may also be relevant subcategories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
