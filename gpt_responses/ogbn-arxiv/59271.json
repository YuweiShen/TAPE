The use of crowdsourcing and multiple workers per sentence to capture inter-annotator disagreement suggests a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The paper also presents metrics for evaluating frame disambiguation systems, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) or information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses the importance of accounting for ambiguity in natural language processing, which could be relevant to the sub-category of cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
