The paper also discusses the transferability of these adversarial examples across different networks, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The security implications of adversarial examples make it relevant to the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the use of deep features in the proposed approach suggests a connection to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
