The use of Bayesian optimization and structured sparsity also suggests a potential fit for the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on improving recovery performance while maintaining low computational complexity aligns with the goals of the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
