Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes new training objectives for building better sentence encoders, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The evaluation benchmarks and tasks involve measuring the ability of sentence representations to capture broader context information, which could be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
