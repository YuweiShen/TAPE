The focus is on reducing the complexity of Sphere Decoding (SD), which is a technique used in signal processing and communications (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of lattice theory in constructing the STBCs, which is a topic in networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper deals with multiple access channels (MAC), which is a topic in multimedia systems and networking (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of complex orthogonal designs in STBCs, which is a topic in coding theory and cryptography (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
