The use of stochastic encryption and the analysis of its impact on the detection performance involve probabilistic modeling and optimization, which are relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, the paper presents analytical results on the expected sample size, which is a performance metric commonly used in statistical learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
