This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses interference cancellation and symbol detection, which are topics in signal processing (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the proposed algorithm involves message passing, which is a technique commonly used in networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
