The approach involves learning policies for invoking parameterized skills, which can be seen as a form of reinforcement learning (cs.LG). The authors also mention the use of state-dependent policies, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques such as deep learning (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper involves experiments on real-world robotic systems, which suggests the use of control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
