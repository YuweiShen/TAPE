The paper also proposes a framework that combines recent advances in knowledge distillation (cs.LG) and probabilistic logical languages to incorporate spatial knowledge in existing neural networks. The use of probabilistic logical languages also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the task of Visual Question Answering involves reasoning about images, which can be related to robotics (cs.RO) where robots need to perceive and reason about their environment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
