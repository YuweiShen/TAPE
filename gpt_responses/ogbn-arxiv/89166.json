Additionally, the paper mentions the adoption of epistemic principles, which are also relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of algebraic semantics and relational semantics also suggests a connection to the fields of logic and computer science, particularly in the areas of algebraic logic (cs.LG), programming languages (cs.PL), and concurrency theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
