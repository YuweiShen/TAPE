The use of stable matchings is a common technique in this area. The paper also presents a polynomial-time algorithm, which involves data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.DM). Finally, the empirical evaluation of the algorithm involves machine learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
