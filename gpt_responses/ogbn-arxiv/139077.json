This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with the transmission of data over a wireless channel. The paper also considers the practical aspect of finite alphabet inputs, which could fall under the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper proposes an iterative algorithm for determining the precoders, which could fall under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
