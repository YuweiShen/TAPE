The paper also explores modulation and coding schemes (cs.IT), multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) transmission multiplexing format (cs.MM), and acknowledges operation settings (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the networks in terms of access delay (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
