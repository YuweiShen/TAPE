The use of transfer learning and self-supervision to initialize a good representation of the data is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The alternating algorithm proposed in the paper is a novel approach that could be of interest to researchers in the field of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper's focus on reducing overfitting and balancing labelled and unlabelled losses during training suggests that it could also be relevant to researchers in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
