The paper proposes a method to alleviate the problem of unfaithful translations generated by NMT by using a phrase table as recommendation memory. This involves using techniques such as prefix trees, attention vectors, and probability calculations, which are commonly used in NLP and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which focuses on NLP and related topics. Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which are all relevant to the techniques and methods used in this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
