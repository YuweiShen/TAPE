The use of reinforcement learning and machine learning algorithms suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The fact that the robot is vision-capable and the use of perceptual spaces suggests that it could also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Finally, the use of partial observability and coping with less experience suggests that it could also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
