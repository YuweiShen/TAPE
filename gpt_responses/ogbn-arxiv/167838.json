The paper also proposes a memory-enabled hierarchical control policy and an efficient learning mechanism, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper uses simulations to generate and analyze accidents, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
