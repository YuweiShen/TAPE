The paper also uses combinatorial techniques and graph theory to analyze the complexity of the problem, which are common tools in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The paper also discusses treewidth, which is a concept in cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry).
