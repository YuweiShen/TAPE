Additionally, the paper also incorporates color intensity adaptation and frequency scaling optimization at each filter-bank level and spatial orientation to extract and enhance perceptually significant features. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as it deals with image quality assessment, which is a crucial aspect of multimedia processing. \n\nThe Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper proposes a systematic approach to review the evolution of IQA algorithms using unbiased test datasets. Information theory deals with the quantification, storage, and communication of information, which is relevant to the evaluation of image quality. \n\nThe Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories are also possible as the paper proposes a computational model that exploits the concept of object detection and encapsulates characteristics proposed in other IQA algorithms in a unified architecture. This involves the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to evaluate image quality."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
