The paper also applies the framework of smoothed analysis to explain the differences in performance of two algorithms, the Minimum-Mean Cycle Canceling (MMCC) algorithm and the Network Simplex (NS) algorithm. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.NE (Networks and Internet Architecture), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
