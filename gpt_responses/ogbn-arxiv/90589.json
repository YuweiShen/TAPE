The use of the medial shape as a unique deductive scheme suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC). The mention of SAT problems and NP-Time complete satisfiability also points to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the extension of propositional logic without encoding atoms as sub-atoms suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
