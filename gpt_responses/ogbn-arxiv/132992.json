Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category, as it deals with NLP tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques, which are covered in cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Additionally, the paper uses visual features such as font choices and visual layout, which are covered in cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also proposes a joint model that combines textual and visual features, which falls under the scope of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
