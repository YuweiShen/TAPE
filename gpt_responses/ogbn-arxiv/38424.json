This makes cs.RO the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses automated planning for robotic systems, which involves the use of AI techniques. Hence, cs.AI is a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the control of robotic systems in construction processes, which falls under the scope of cs.SY.\n4. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper may involve the use of computer vision techniques for perception and localization of building elements, which makes cs.CV a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper may involve the use of graphics techniques for visualization and simulation of the construction process, which makes cs.GR a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
