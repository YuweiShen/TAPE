The study also involves measuring problem difficulty through computational steps, which is related to machine learning and computational complexity (cs.LG and cs.CC). Finally, the investigation of hyperparameters and their effects on model performance is relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
