The protocol is designed to work with low-power and low-compute-capable robots, which suggests a focus on networking and communication (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of MQTT-SN, which is a protocol for the Internet of Things, indicating a possible connection to systems and networking (cs.SY). The implementation of the protocol on low-power IEEE 802.15.4 radios suggests a focus on hardware and embedded systems (cs.MA). Lastly, the paper discusses the implementation of multi-robot applications, which could fall under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
