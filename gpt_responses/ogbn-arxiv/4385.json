The algorithms presented in the paper involve computational geometry techniques, such as collision detection and separation distance, which are also relevant to the subfield of computational geometry (cs.CG). The problem of coordinated motion planning involves scheduling and optimization, which are topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the complexity of the problem, which is related to the theory of algorithms and computational complexity (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with the practical implementation of the algorithms, which is relevant to the subfield of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
