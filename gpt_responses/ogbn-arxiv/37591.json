The proposed method involves semi-supervised learning, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of automatic labeling and co-occurrence matrix analysis involves artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of deformable neural networks, which is a subfield of neural networks (cs.NE).
