It also proposes a flow that performs design space exploration to generate a customized hardware architecture and software operator library. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper focuses on deep learning acceleration for object classification and style transfer, which are common tasks in AI. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a runtime system equipped with a JIT compiler for flexible code-generation and heterogeneous execution, which is relevant to systems and control. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper deploys optimized deep learning models for object classification and style transfer, which are tasks in computer vision. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper proposes a two-level ISA and a JIT compiler, which are relevant to programming languages."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
