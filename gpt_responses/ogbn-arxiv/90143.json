The use of non-Abelian groups is a novel approach to coding theory, which could be of interest to researchers in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the performance of the codes in the presence of adversarial attacks, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The potential applications of non-Abelian codes in multi-terminal settings and the exploitation of code structure suggest that the paper could also be relevant to researchers in signal processing (cs.SI) and distributed computing (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
