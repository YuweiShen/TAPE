The study investigates how the personality of the virtual interviewer influences a user's behavior, specifically their willingness to confide in and listen to the virtual interviewer. This work involves the intersection of human-computer interaction (cs.HC), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computational linguistics (cs.CL), cyberpsychology (cs.CY), and information retrieval (cs.IR) as it involves developing a virtual agent that can understand and respond to user behavior and language."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
