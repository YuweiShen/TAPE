This is a topic that is relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and deep learning (cs.DL). Given the focus on deep learning architectures and their applications, cs.LG and cs.DL are the most likely sub-categories. However, the use of residual blocks and their impact on stability and generalization power also suggest relevance to cs.CV and cs.NE. Finally, the focus on improving existing architectures without introducing new parameters suggests relevance to cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
