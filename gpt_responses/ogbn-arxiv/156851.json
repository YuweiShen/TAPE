It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as the proposed method is deployed on a real robot for grasping and manipulation. Additionally, the paper involves the use of deep learning techniques, which could place it in the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it deals with 3D object pose estimation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
