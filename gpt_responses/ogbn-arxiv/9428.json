It also involves training deep neural networks, which falls under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. The paper also mentions using the proposed algorithm on image datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10, which suggests it could be relevant to Computer Vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper involves training feedback weights to approximate forward activations, which could be relevant to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
