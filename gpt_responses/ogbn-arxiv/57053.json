The algorithm uses raw laser data and odometry information to navigate without relying on a map. The paper also discusses the use of a reward function shaped based on the online knowledge of the map of the training environment, obtained using grid-based Rao-Blackwellized particle filter, to enhance the obstacle awareness of the agent. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.RO (Robotics)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision)\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
