The use of Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) and linear minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) receiver also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the signal processing (cs.SI) or multimedia (cs.MM) categories. Finally, the optimization techniques used in the paper may also relate to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
