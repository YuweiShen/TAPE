The proposed Crystal Loss function is a new loss function for training deep networks, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) category. The paper also discusses the use of quality pooling, which is a technique for aggregating features, and this falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) category. The paper also involves optimization of features, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method in terms of false alarm rates, which falls under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
