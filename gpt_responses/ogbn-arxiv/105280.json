It also involves deep learning techniques, which makes it likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions experiments on indoor and outdoor scenes, which suggests that it may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of canonical correlation analysis as a training objective suggests that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
