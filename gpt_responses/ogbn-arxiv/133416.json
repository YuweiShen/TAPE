The paper also proposes a theoretical framework for enforcing properties on CBS, which involves formal methods and logic (cs.LO). The BIP framework used in the paper is a language for modeling and simulating heterogeneous systems, which falls under programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the implementation of the approach in a tool, which involves distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper deals with ensuring correct behavior of systems, which is a topic related to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
