Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a likely sub-category as well. The experiments conducted in the paper involve training and improving NMT systems, which falls under the scope of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves attention allocation, which is a common technique used in neural networks, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of parallel corpora and automated evaluation, which falls under the scope of cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
