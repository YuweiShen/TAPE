Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also discusses compression and decompression processes, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and database systems (cs.DB). Additionally, the use of hash map table and repeat sequences suggests a possible connection to computational engineering (cs.CE) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
