The paper also introduces a novel region proposal network and a new detection network, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.AI, cs.LG). The proposed method aims to improve object detection performance, which is a common problem in robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on commonly used benchmarks, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
