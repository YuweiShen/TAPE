This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also discusses the computational complexity of constructing polar codes, which could fall under the computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-category. The use of partial orders and bipartite graphs suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the discrete structures (cs.DS) and social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on improving the complexity of the construction problem suggests that it could also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
