This involves estimating model parameters via CP decomposition of observed higher order input moments. The paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it deals with parameter estimation of latent variable models. It is also likely to be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) as convolutional models are commonly used in image processing. Additionally, the paper involves projections onto the space of stacked circulant matrices, which is related to topics in cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). Finally, the paper's focus on efficient and parallel algorithms may also make it relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
