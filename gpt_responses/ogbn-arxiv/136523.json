The paper proposes a generic framework for optimizing non-decomposable performance metrics like the F1 score, which is a popular metric in many subfields of computer science. The paper also addresses the issue of missing labels, which is a common problem in many real-world applications. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to several subfields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), computational linguistics (cs.CL), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
