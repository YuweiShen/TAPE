The paper also describes a system that can plan, apply and adapt grasps on objects, which is a typical robotics application. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper uses simulated tactile data to evaluate hypothetical grasps, which is a common technique in computer vision for evaluating object properties. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents an adaptive grasping method that uses simulated data to guide the search for better grasps, which is a typical AI approach to problem-solving. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a probabilistic approach to estimate the success of grasps, which is a common machine learning technique. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper describes a system that can plan, apply and adapt grasps on objects, which is a typical systems and control application."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
