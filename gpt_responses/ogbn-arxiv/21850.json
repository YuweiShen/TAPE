The paper also proposes a novel minimax training framework for fuzzy hash functions, which can be used to detect malware. Therefore, cs.CR is the most likely category. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques, specifically kernel networks, and perturbation-consistent adversarial training. Hence, it could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) categories. \n\nThe paper uses Portable Executable files, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks, and the proposed method involves kernel embeddings, which are also used in computer vision. Therefore, the paper could also belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision) category. \n\nFinally, the paper proposes a new architecture for fuzzy hashing, which involves alternating roles of players during training. This is a software engineering concept, and hence, the paper could also belong to the cs.SE (Software Engineering) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
