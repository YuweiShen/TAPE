The paper proposes a power allocation algorithm for minimizing the total transmit power while ensuring a minimum SINR at the desired receiver, which is a common problem in information theory and networked systems. Additionally, the paper takes into account the self-protecting architecture of layered transmission and artificial noise generation to prevent potential information eavesdropping, which is a topic of interest in cryptography. Finally, the paper proposes suboptimal power allocation schemes with low computational complexity, which is a common problem in control systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
