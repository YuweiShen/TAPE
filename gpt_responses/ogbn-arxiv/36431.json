The paper discusses the achievable rates for the primary system and the BD transmission, and formulates two transmit beamforming optimization problems. The paper also proposes a novel transmit beamforming structure to reduce computational complexity. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper discusses simulation results, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
