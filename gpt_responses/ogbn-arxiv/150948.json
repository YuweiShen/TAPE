The use of multi-level neural networks also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of color moments and wavelets decomposition, which are common techniques in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
