Therefore, cs.CL and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the formalization of CNLs into logical reasoning systems, which falls under the category of computational logic (cs.LG, cs.CC). Finally, the paper proposes non-monotonic extensions of CNLs, which involves argumentation theory and reasoning about exceptions, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
