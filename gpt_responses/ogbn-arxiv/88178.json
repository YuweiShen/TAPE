It also involves the use of Boolean networks, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper discusses the interaction graph, which is a concept in network science (cs.NI) and the reduction of coding functions, which is a technique in computer science (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents results on the solvability problem, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
