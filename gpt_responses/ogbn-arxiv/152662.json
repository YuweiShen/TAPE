These are all topics that fall under the umbrella of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.DS). The paper also mentions graph searching games, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG). Additionally, the paper discusses tradeoffs between different graph parameters, which is a topic in game theory (cs.GT) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
