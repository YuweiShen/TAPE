The use of algorithms to minimize the number of probes required suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The problem of determining the shape and orientation of a convex polygon also involves graph theory (cs.GR) and computational science (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
