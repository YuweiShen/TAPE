This involves synthesizing policies with different cooperation degrees and training a cooperation degree detection network in an offline phase, and adaptively selecting policies based on the detected degree of opponent cooperation in an online phase. This work involves aspects of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) in the use of deep reinforcement learning, as well as game theory (cs.GT) in the study of social dilemmas. It also involves multiagent systems (cs.MA) in the investigation of interactions between multiple agents, and social and information networks (cs.SI) in the analysis of cooperation and exploitation in SPD games."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
