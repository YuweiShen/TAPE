The paper also discusses network coding schemes, which could fall under the networked systems (cs.NI) sub-category. The use of superposition coding and interference decoding could also fall under the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The paper mentions the combination network (CN) as a case study, which could fall under the computer communications (cs.CC) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses examples of CNs with multiple receivers, which could fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
