The paper also discusses probabilistic labeling models and objective measurement principles, which are topics typically studied in the sub-categories of cs.AI, cs.LG, and cs.CV. Additionally, the paper validates its method using real crowdsourcing datasets with binary, multiclass, or ordinal labels, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of cs.IR and cs.CL. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.IR, and cs.CL, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
