Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also involves complexity theory, which suggests it could also belong to cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Additionally, the paper deals with propositional logic, which could place it in cs.PL (Programming Languages). The use of circuit-style structures and resource sharing could also suggest a connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
