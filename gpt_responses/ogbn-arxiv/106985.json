Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) as these are all related to machine learning. The paper also discusses the use of attribute information and network characteristics, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks).
