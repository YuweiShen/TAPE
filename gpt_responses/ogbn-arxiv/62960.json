It proposes a novel economic approach based on contract theory to incentivize users to accept being served over unlicensed bands. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the problem of spectrum allocation in cellular networks and proposes a distributed algorithm to assign users to licensed and unlicensed spectra. \n3. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper formulates the problem of spectrum allocation as a matching game with incomplete information and proposes a distributed algorithm to solve it. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a practical model in which the information about the quality-of-service (QoS) required by every user is not known to the MNO and other users, and derives a closed-form expression of the price charged by the MNO for every user. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the impact of the proposed pricing mechanism on the QoS requirements of users and shows that it can increase the fraction of users that achieve their QoS requirements by up to 45%."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
