This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper addresses security concerns and attacks, which could also place it under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of deep learning for biometric spoofing detection also involves multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
