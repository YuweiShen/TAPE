The use of suffix arrays and suffix automata suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The problem of computing minimal absent words also has connections to combinatorics and graph theory, which are covered by the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) sub-categories. The paper also presents experimental results using real and synthetic data, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Finally, the problem of computing minimal absent words has applications in bioinformatics, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
