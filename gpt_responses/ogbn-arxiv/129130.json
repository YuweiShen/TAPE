The proposed scheme is based on distributed source coding, which is a common technique in network information theory (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of non-unique decoding, which is a topic in distributed systems (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). The application of the scheme to the caching problem involves cache placement and prefetching, which are topics in storage systems (cs.SI) and content delivery networks (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
