The use of a fully-convolutional network architecture also suggests that it is likely to be related to machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a new approach for video saliency detection, which involves temporal aggregation, indicating that it may be related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
