Therefore, cs.NI (networking and internet architecture) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of radio resource management (RRM) and interference management, which could fall under cs.IT (information theory) and cs.CR (cryptography and security). Additionally, the paper involves the implementation and evaluation of a prototype, which could fall under cs.MM (multimedia) and cs.COM (computer communication networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
