The paper proposes a novel multi-level memory architecture for these systems, which involves storing query results in cells rather than triples. This is a technical paper that focuses on the design and implementation of a specific system, so it is likely to be categorized under computer science - Computation and Language (cs.CL). However, it also involves machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE) as well as information retrieval (cs.IR) and knowledge representation (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
