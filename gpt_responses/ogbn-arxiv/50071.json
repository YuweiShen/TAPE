The paper focuses on the design of the aerial backhaul scheme, which involves network formation among UAVs seeking to form a multi-hop backhaul network in the air. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). \n\nAdditionally, the paper involves the use of UAVs, which are autonomous systems that require control and navigation algorithms. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.RO (Robotics), which deals with the design and control of robots and autonomous systems. \n\nFurthermore, the paper involves the optimization of the backhaul network, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the transmission, processing, and storage of information. \n\nThe paper also involves the coordination of multiple UAVs, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control), which deals with the analysis and control of complex systems. \n\nFinally, the paper involves simulation results, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia), which deals with the processing and analysis of multimedia data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
