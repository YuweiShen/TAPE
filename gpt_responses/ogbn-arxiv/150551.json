The paper also presents simulations and experimental results, which are common in robotics research. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with controlling a system (mobile robot) with noisy actuators and measuring its motion in the environment. The paper also presents a control policy to maximize the probability of satisfaction of a given specification. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses Statistical Model Checking (SMC) to obtain an MDP control policy that maximizes the probability of satisfaction. SMC is a common technique used in AI research. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to map the measurements of the mobile robot to a control policy. MDPs are commonly used in machine learning research. \n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a feedback control strategy for the mobile robot based on the MDP control policy. This involves implementing software for the control strategy, which falls under the domain of software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
