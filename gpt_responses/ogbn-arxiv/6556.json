The paper uses techniques from computational complexity theory, graph theory, and probability theory to establish lower bounds for the Sum of Squares (SOS) semidefinite hierarchy. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CC (Computational Complexity), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
