However, the paper also mentions specific applications such as computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), indicating that these subfields may also be relevant. Additionally, the paper deals with both smooth and non-smooth problems, which suggests that it may be relevant to the subfields of data structures (cs.DS) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
