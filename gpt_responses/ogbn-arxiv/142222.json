The paper proposes a new method for generating evasive spams to test the effectiveness of existing detectors, which involves machine learning techniques such as maximum entropy and rating sampling (cs.IR, cs.LG). The paper also discusses the limitations of existing detectors and the need for a behavior-based approach to spam detection, which involves analyzing the patterns and characteristics of spamming behavior (cs.SI, cs.CL). Overall, the paper covers a range of topics related to cybersecurity, machine learning, and natural language processing, which are relevant to several arXiv CS sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
