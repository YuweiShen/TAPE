The method is based on clustering, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The existing ZSL methods are for image data, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) subfields. The proposed method is evaluated using a dataset, which involves classification, a subfield of cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
