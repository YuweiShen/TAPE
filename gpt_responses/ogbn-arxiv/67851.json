It specifically focuses on multicast, which involves communication between multiple nodes in a network (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a distributed algorithm, which falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC). The application of the algorithm is for graphics or video streaming, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and the algorithm aims to maximize the total rate achieved by all receivers, which is a goal of optimization and scheduling in communication networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
