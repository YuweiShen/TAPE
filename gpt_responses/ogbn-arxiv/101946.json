The paper also deals with geometric tolerances and compliance, which are important topics in computational geometry (cs.CG) and mathematical optimization (cs.MS). The use of half-spaces and polytopes to control the topology of polyhedra is also relevant to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper's focus on solving operations on sets of constraints could also be relevant to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
