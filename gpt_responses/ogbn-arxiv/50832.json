Information theory is the study of communication systems and their limits, which is relevant to this paper. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with the design and analysis of a relay-aided cellular network, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a new scheme for interference management in cellular networks, which can be seen as a control problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the transmission of multiple streams of data in a cellular network, which is relevant to multimedia applications. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society) - The paper does not directly deal with societal issues related to computing, but it may have implications for the design and deployment of cellular networks, which can be seen as a societal issue."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
