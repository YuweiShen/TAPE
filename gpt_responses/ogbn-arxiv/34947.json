This involves extracting a predictive model from visuomotor experiences related to object-directed behaviors. The paper also discusses the error minimization principle in the predictive coding framework and the need for sufficient generalization through a large number of learning trajectories. Based on these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is robotics (cs.RO), followed by machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
