The paper proposes a novel bandit-based approach for this problem, which falls under the category of optimization algorithms. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as these sub-categories are also relevant to the problem of hyperparameter optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
