Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves the reconstruction of articulated human skeleton motion and non-rigid surface deformations, which falls under the category of graphics (cs.GR). The use of convolutional neural networks for pose estimation and trajectory subspace also involves machine learning (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper presents state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy and robustness, which could be of interest to the community of statistical learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
