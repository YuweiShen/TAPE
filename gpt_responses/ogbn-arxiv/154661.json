The paper also mentions that the proposed method is scalable to both high dimensions and large numbers of samples, which suggests that it can be applied to computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and data science (cs.DS) problems. Additionally, the paper mentions benchmarks with large numbers of high-dimensional data, which suggests that it can also be applied to multimedia (cs.MM) problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
