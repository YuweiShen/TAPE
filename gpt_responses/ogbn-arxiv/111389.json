The analysis of cycles and degrees in partial cubes also relates to graph theory (cs.DS) and graph algorithms (cs.GT). Finally, the use of formulas to describe graph properties suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of computational complexity and optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
