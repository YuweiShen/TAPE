This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) as it involves transmitting information over a noisy channel. The privacy aspect of the problem suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of mutual information and side information in the problem suggests that it may be related to machine learning (cs.LG) and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the problem of distributed decision-making may also be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
