The use of Gaussian measurements and noise also suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as a possible sub-category. The optimization problems involved in the paper also suggest numerical analysis (cs.NA) as a potential sub-category. Finally, the experiments conducted in the paper involve matrices belonging to different constraint classes, which could fall under scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
