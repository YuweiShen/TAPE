The paper proposes non-adaptive sampling procedures that allow successful identification of the infected population with overwhelming probability. This involves designing probabilistic and explicit procedures that require a small number of agents to single out the infected individuals. The paper also discusses the use of compressed sensing techniques in this context. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
