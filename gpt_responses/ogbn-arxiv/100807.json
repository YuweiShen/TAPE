The approach involves using mirror descent algorithm for exact maximum a posterior inference and back propagation with stochastic gradient descent for model parameter estimation. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
