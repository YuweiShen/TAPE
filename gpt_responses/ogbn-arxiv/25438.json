The proposed method involves the use of supervised learning (cs.DL) and image processing algorithms (cs.MM) to classify and separate compound figures. Additionally, the paper discusses the evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed method, which could fall under natural language processing (cs.CL) as it involves evaluating the performance of a machine learning model."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
