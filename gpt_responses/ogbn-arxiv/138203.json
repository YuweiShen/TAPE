This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), cryptography and security (cs.CR), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). However, given the focus on deep neural networks and support vector machines, as well as the use of empirical and theoretical analysis to evaluate the proposed regularization technique, cs.LG is the most likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
