Additionally, the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and neural networks in general suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the vulnerability of deep neural networks to attacks, which suggests that it may belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category.
