Therefore, the most likely category is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as they are related to perception and decision-making in autonomous systems. The paper also involves data processing and filtering, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
