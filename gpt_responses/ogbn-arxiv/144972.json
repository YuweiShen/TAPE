The paper also focuses on the approximation of nonlinear functions, which is a common problem in machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a normalization scheme, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and cybernetics (cs.CY). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed method in security- and privacy-aware analytics applications, which falls under the category of social and information sciences (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
