The power scheduling algorithm may also involve distributed computation and communication among different components of the system. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper deals with renewable energy generation and battery storage, which are considered as emerging technologies in the field of energy systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
