Therefore, cs.AI and cs.LO are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also deals with the design of a solver, which falls under the category of Programming Languages (PL), making cs.PL another likely sub-category. The use of GPUs for general-purpose computing is a recent trend, and the paper discusses the challenges of exploiting GPU parallelism, which could fall under Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (DC) or Architecture (AR). Hence, these two sub-categories are also likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
