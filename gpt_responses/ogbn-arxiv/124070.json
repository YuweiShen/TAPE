This framework involves learning an uncertainty-aware dynamics model and optimizing the policy according to these learned models. The paper also evaluates the proposed approach on challenging continuous control benchmarks, which suggests that it belongs to the machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and multiagent systems (cs.MA) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
