The paper also proposes a training objective that is invariant to changes in depth range and scale, which is a machine learning technique, hence cs.LG is also likely. The paper also mentions 3D films as a source of training data, which involves robotics and graphics, hence cs.RO and cs.GR are also possible categories. Finally, the paper discusses the generality of the learned model, which is related to artificial intelligence, hence cs.AI is also a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
