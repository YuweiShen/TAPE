Specifically, the focus on natural language processing and semantic change suggests that cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The use of these techniques for information retrieval and OCR algorithms suggests relevance to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.CY (Computers and Society). The incorporation of models of diachronic conceptual change suggests relevance to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
