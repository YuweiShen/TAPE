The most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper focuses on active learning algorithms for combining humans and algorithms in a machine learning context. The second likely category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), as the paper discusses the practical challenges of relying solely on the crowd for acquiring labeled data. The third likely category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval), as the paper mentions tasks such as analyzing sentiment, which are often relevant to information retrieval. The fourth likely category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as the paper discusses the complementary strengths of humans and algorithms in various tasks. The fifth likely category is cs.DB (Databases), as the paper proposes algorithms for integrating machine learning into crowd-sourced databases."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
