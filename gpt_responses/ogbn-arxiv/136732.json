The paper specifically focuses on object-level video summarization using an online motion auto-encoder. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves learning and optimization techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves multimedia analysis and retrieval, which could place it in cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also involves information retrieval and could belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper involves artificial intelligence techniques, which could place it in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
