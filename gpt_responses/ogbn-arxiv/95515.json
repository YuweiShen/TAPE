The methodology presented in the paper involves optimization techniques, which can be categorized under signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper also deals with MIMO channel size, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
