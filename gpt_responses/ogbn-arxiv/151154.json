The focus on pattern-based methods and the use of morpho-syntactical annotations suggest a stronger connection to cs.CL, but the potential application of the proposed boosting method to any pattern-based relation extraction method could also make it relevant to cs.IR and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
