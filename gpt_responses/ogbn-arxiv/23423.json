This involves statistical active learning algorithms that rely on estimates of expectations of functions of filtered random examples. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the complexity of the resulting algorithms, which may fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
