The use of deep learning methods also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. The paper also involves the estimation of optical flows, which could place it in the Multimedia (cs.MM) category. Additionally, the use of motion compensation and the focus on improving temporal dependency could suggest the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. Finally, the use of super-resolution techniques could also place it in the Graphics (cs.GR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
