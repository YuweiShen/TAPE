Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses spectral efficiency and communication delay, which are related to Information Theory (cs.IT) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the feasibility of D2D communication in Long-Term Evolution Advanced, which is related to Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category.
