It could also belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category as it introduces a new formalism for reasoning. Additionally, it could be classified under Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) as it deals with linguistic features for expressing defeasible knowledge. The paper also touches on the topic of legal reasoning, which could place it in the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on formalism and logic could also make it relevant to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
