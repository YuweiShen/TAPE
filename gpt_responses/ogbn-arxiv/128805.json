The paper also discusses the use of quality-sensitive bit rate adaptation, which involves optimizing the compression algorithm based on local image complexity and visual saliency, which could fall under machine learning (cs.MM) and/or information theory (cs.IT). The use of deep neural networks also suggests that the paper could be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
