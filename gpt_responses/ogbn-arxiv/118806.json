The proposed method uses convolutional neural networks (cs.LG) and is trained in an end-to-end fashion using a combination of Euclidean loss and Total Variation (TV) loss, which are common techniques in deep learning and optimization (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed method on both synthetic and real SAR images, which involves image processing and analysis (cs.GR). Finally, the paper mentions the use of batch normalization and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, which are common techniques in deep learning for image and signal processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
