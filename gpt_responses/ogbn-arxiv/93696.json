The proposed method involves incorporating a mixture-of-experts layer, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the adaptation of hierarchical feature aggregation, which involves the use of contextual information, a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep convolutional neural networks is also a topic related to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on two scene parsing datasets, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
