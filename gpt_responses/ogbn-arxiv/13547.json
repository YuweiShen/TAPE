Here are the reasons for the suggested categories: \n\n- cs.GR (Computer Graphics): Deformation fields are a fundamental concept in computer graphics, where they are used for tasks such as shape animation, morphing, and editing. The paper's focus on coordinate-free representations and linear operators is particularly relevant to this field. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): Deformation fields are also important in computer vision, where they are used for tasks such as shape matching, registration, and segmentation. The paper's emphasis on functional operators and metric distortion could be relevant to this field as well. \n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): Deformation fields are a natural topic in computational geometry, where they are studied in the context of shape analysis, optimization, and modeling. The paper's use of linear-algebraic tools and guarantees of equivalence between different representations could be of interest to this community. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): Deformation fields are often represented and processed using numerical methods, such as finite element analysis or spectral methods. The paper's focus on linear operators and functional representations could be relevant to this field as well. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Deformation fields are increasingly being studied in the context of machine"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
