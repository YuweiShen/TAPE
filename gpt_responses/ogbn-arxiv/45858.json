The use of remote sensing and in situ measurements involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The validation of hyperspectral data involves computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed planning algorithm is based on Monte Carlo Tree Search, which is a popular technique in machine learning and reinforcement learning (cs.LG). Finally, the problem of joint optimization of sampling locations and model of the environment can be seen as a control problem, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
