This approach is important in domains where multiple agents cooperate and delegate tasks among themselves, e.g. through social commitments, and need to ensure that a delegating agent can infer whether or not another agent is actually progressing towards a delegated task. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses an approach based on domain independent heuristics from automated planning, which is a subfield of AI. \n- cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper focuses on domains where multiple agents cooperate and delegate tasks among themselves, which is a core topic in multiagent systems. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, but the approach it proposes could potentially be used in conjunction with machine learning techniques. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper does not explicitly mention robotics, but the approach it proposes could potentially be applied in robotics domains where multiple agents are involved. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper does not explicitly mention systems and control, but the approach it proposes could potentially be applied in control systems where multiple agents are involved."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
