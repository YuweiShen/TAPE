This falls under the scope of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a low-complexity algorithm for the reconfiguration state and beam selection, which can be applied in networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The use of reconfigurable antennas in mmWave MIMO can improve the performance of multimedia applications, such as video streaming and virtual reality. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents an architecture of reconfigurable mmWave MIMO with beamspace hybrid analog-digital beamformers and reconfigurable antennas at both the transmitter and the receiver, which involves system design and control. \n5. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The use of reconfigurable antennas in mmWave MIMO requires hardware design and implementation, which falls under the scope of hardware architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
