This involves reasoning about change actions and differential maps, which are concepts that are closely related to logic. \n\n2. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the semi-naive evaluation of Datalog queries, which is a well-known technique in database programming. The paper also introduces a calculus for incremental computation, which is relevant to programming language design. \n\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper deals with the problem of incremental computation, which is a fundamental problem in data structures and algorithms. The paper also discusses the semi-naive evaluation of Datalog queries, which is a well-known algorithmic technique in database systems. \n\n4. cs.DB (Databases): The paper discusses the semi-naive evaluation of Datalog queries, which is a well-known technique in database systems.
