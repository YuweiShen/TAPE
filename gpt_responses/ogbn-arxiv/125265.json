The use of object-based models to reduce communication requirements suggests a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV). The paper proposes distributed algorithms for pose graph optimization, which is a common optimization problem in robotics and computer vision, and the use of machine learning techniques to improve the performance of the algorithms, which suggests a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a privacy-preserving approach to distributed mapping, which suggests a possible connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
