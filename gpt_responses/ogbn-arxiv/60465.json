The proposed solution involves the use of principal component analysis (PCA), which is a technique commonly used in machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the optimization of spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), which are topics related to systems and control (cs.SY).
