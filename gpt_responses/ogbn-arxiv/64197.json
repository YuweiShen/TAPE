The proposed method involves the use of attention-based encoder-decoder framework, which is a popular technique in natural language processing (cs.CL). The method also involves estimating probabilities, which is a common task in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on standard benchmarks, which is a common practice in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
