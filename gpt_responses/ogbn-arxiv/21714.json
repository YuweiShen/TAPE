This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses efficient ways of applying these mobile models, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of deep learning techniques and convolutional neural networks also suggests that the paper could belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its performance on various datasets, which could fall under the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
