Game theory is a natural fit for analyzing such scenarios, and the paper explicitly mentions computing equilibrium strategies for the agents. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves learning the qualities of agents and tasks, which is a core problem in AI. The paper also mentions that the mechanism needs to balance rewards and costs of exerting effort, which is a common theme in AI research on reinforcement learning and multi-agent systems. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves learning the qualities of agents and tasks, which is a core problem in machine learning. The paper also mentions that the mechanism needs to balance rewards and costs of exerting effort, which is a common theme in machine learning research on reinforcement learning and optimization. \n4. cs.EC (Economics and Computation): The paper involves designing a mechanism for matching agents to tasks, which is a core problem in the intersection of economics and computation. The paper also mentions adverse selection and moral hazard, which are classic concepts in economics. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper involves designing a mechanism for matching agents to tasks, which can be viewed as a problem in data structures and algorithms.
