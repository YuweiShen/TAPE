The abstract mentions the use of heavy traffic approximation technique, which is commonly used in queuing theory and stochastic processes (cs.PR). However, since the focus of the paper is on the application of these techniques to a specific problem in wireless networks, we consider cs.IT, cs.NI, cs.SY, cs.MM, and cs.GT to be the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
