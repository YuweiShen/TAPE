The optimization involves beamforming and relay mode selection, which are typical topics in information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a novel concept of hybrid relay communications, which involves switching between active RF communications and passive backscatter communications. This is a networking concept that can improve the overall relay performance.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper involves optimizing the relay performance by jointly optimizing the HAP's beamforming, individual relays' radio mode, the PS ratio, and the relays' collaborative beamforming. This is a control problem that can be addressed using optimization techniques.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper aims to enhance the throughput performance at the receiver, which is a typical multimedia performance metric.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a convex approximation to the original problem and designs an iterative algorithm to solve the problem. This involves computational techniques that are relevant to computational engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
