The use of Spherical Radial Basis Functions (SBF) for geometric modeling also falls under computational geometry. The paper also mentions the use of the algorithm for modifying node sets for time-varying embedded boundaries, which could be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR). Overall, the paper's focus on meshfree discretizations and geometric modeling suggests that it is most likely to belong to cs.NA and cs.CG, with cs.GR and cs.CV being less likely but still possible."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
