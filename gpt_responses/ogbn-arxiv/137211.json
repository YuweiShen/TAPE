This topic is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Additionally, the paper borrows the idea of Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) model, which is commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
