The paper uses neural networks and unsupervised word representations such as ELMo or BERT, which are commonly used in the subfields of computational linguistics (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of conditional random fields, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on human subjects, which is a common practice in the subfield of neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
