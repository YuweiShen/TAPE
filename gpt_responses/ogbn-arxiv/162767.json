This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method is evaluated on image classification tasks, which are typically addressed in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the problem of noisy labels, which is a common issue in cybersecurity (cs.CR) where attackers can manipulate data to mislead machine learning models. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.CL, and cs.CR, in descending order of likelihood."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
