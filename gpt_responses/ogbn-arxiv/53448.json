The paper proposes a supervised attention mechanism that is learned with guidance from conventional alignment models, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the re-ordering issue in the attention mechanism, which is related to optimization and learning theory (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper uses experiments to evaluate the proposed method, which involves numerical analysis and statistical methods (cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions using Chinese-to-English translation tasks, which could involve computer vision techniques for handling Chinese characters (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
