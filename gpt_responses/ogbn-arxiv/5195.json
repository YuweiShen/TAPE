This topic falls under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and social and information networks (cs.SI). However, given the focus on deep ReLU networks, cs.LG and cs.NE are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
