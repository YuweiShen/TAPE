It also discusses the limits of decidability in the stable growth of complexity and establishes undecidability as a requirement for systems exhibiting strong open-ended evolution. These topics are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), logic in computer science (cs.LO), computational complexity (cs.CC), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
