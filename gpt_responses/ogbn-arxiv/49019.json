The paper also involves machine learning techniques, such as adversarial training, which suggests it could be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of a bird's eye view (BEV) detection framework, which could be relevant to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
