This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the transmit strategies and ergodic rate loss, which are topics related to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper presents a dual multiple access channel, which is a topic related to communication (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
