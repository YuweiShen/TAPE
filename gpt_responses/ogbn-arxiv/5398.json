The proposed method involves learning a projection function and exploiting multiple semantic representations, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates its approach on benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) and natural language processing (cs.CL) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
