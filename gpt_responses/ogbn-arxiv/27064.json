The focus on identifying security flaws suggests a potential fit with the computer security (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of adaptive learning and probability distributions suggests a potential fit with the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of program instrumentation and code coverage suggests a potential fit with the programming languages (cs.PL) sub-category.
