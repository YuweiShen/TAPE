The paper also introduces new tractable classes of classical planning, which falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL). The algorithm uses machine learning techniques, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of macros in robotics (cs.RO) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
