This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The approach is applied to control manufacturing processes, which suggests that the paper is also likely to belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories.
