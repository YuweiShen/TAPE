The paper proposes a new design framework for concurrent data structures, which involves exploring a two-dimensional space of design choices, which falls under the category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the implementation and evaluation of the proposed design on parallel architectures, which falls under the category of Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Performance (cs.PF). Finally, the paper emphasizes the importance of deterministic relaxation bounds for achieving better performance, which falls under the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
