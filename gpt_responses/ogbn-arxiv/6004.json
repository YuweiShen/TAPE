The study design involves a multi-staged procedure to infer an empirically founded theory, which suggests a focus on software development (cs.SD) and programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses issues related to the classification of NFRs, which could be related to machine learning (cs.LG) and cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
