This involves the use of multiple antennas at the transmitter, which can be analyzed using information theory concepts. \n2. cs.EM (Electromagnetics): The paper deals with wireless power transfer, which is a topic in electromagnetics. The authors also discuss the physics-based and curve fitting-based nonlinear models of the energy harvester, which can be analyzed using electromagnetic principles. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new signal design for wireless power transfer, which can be seen as a control problem. The authors also discuss the efficacy of the scheme using circuit simulations, prototyping, and experimentation, which can be analyzed using systems and control principles. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with wireless power transfer, which is a topic in networking and internet architecture. The authors also discuss the use of multiple antennas at the transmitter to induce fast fluctuations of the wireless channel, which can be analyzed using networking principles. \n5. cs.PE (Performance Evaluation): The paper discusses the efficacy of the proposed signal design for wireless power transfer using physics-based and curve fitting-based nonlinear models of the energy harvester"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
