It is also likely to belong to cs.RO (Robotics) because it evaluates the proposed approach on two representative dynamic robotic learning problems. Additionally, it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) because it deals with learning control policies for high-dimensional systems. It could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) because it leverages physical priors in the form of an approximate system dynamics model. Finally, it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) because it deals with learning control policies for continuous control MDPs, which could involve visual perception."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
