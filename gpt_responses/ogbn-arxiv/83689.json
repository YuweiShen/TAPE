The paper proposes the use of proactive eavesdropping and cognitive jamming to intercept and decode information from suspicious communication links and disrupt/disable/spoof targeted malicious wireless communications. This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and network security (cs.NI). The proposed techniques also involve the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and system engineering (cs.SY) to achieve the desired intervention tasks. Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation and evaluation of the proposed techniques, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
