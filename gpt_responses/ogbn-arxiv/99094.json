The use of computational algebraic geometry and convex relaxations suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of computer science related to optimization (cs.DS, cs.NA) and machine learning (cs.LG). However, the specific applications in 3D vision, such as rigid body transformation estimation and camera autocalibration, suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the use of consensus maximization suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
