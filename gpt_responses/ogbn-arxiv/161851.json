It also involves natural language generation (cs.CL) and generative models (cs.LG). The use of Policy Gradient, a strategy from Reinforcement Learning, suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the evaluation of the method on large datasets suggests a possible connection to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
