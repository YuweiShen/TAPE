The paper also discusses the effect of synthetic gradients on the representational strength of the learning system, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The practical experiments involve feed-forward networks, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) applications. Finally, the paper discusses the relationship of synthetic gradients to other error approximation techniques, which is related to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
