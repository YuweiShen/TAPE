Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel similarity metric method, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions the use of domain knowledge in the feature extractor, which is related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with geospatial objects, which falls under the category of cs.GR (Graphics). Finally, the paper proposes a 2-stage object detection pipeline, which is related to cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
