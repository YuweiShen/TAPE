Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also discusses soundness proofs and type safety, which are topics typically associated with cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.TYPES (Type Theory), respectively. Additionally, the paper mentions module systems and family polymorphism, which are relevant to cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.MS (Mathematical Software), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
