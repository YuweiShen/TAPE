The use of network function virtualization (NFV) and service function chaining (SFC) to enable agile mission offloading is also discussed, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also touches upon the coordination of resources in a system, which is a topic in systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the security implications of bi-directional mission offloading, which is a topic in cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
