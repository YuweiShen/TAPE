The use of CMA-ES, a derivative-free optimization algorithm, is the main focus of the paper. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also specifically mentions tuning hyperparameters for a convolutional neural network on the MNIST dataset, indicating relevance to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
