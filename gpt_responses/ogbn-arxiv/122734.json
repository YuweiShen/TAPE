It also involves deep learning techniques, which makes it relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of multiview geometry and stereo rectification suggests that it may also be relevant to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the application of the framework to diverse species, including humans, dogs, and monkeys, suggests that it may be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
