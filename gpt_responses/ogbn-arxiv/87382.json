The paper also discusses the behavior of generalized values under joins of foreign key sequences, which is a topic in programming languages (cs.PL). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of different monads to store vastly different types of information in the database, which is a topic in logic (cs.LO) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the capture of classical concepts like Markov chains, graphs, and finite state automata, which is a topic in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
