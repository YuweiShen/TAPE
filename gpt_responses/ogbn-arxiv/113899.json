The paper proposes a low rank structured matrix completion approach to solve this problem, which is a common technique in information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm, which is a common topic in signal processing (cs.SP) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper provides extensive numerical experiments to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, which is a common practice in scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
