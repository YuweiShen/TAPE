The paper also uses techniques from approximation theory and statistical learning theory, which are relevant to computer science theory (cs.CC) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses the estimation of functionals of high-dimensional parameters, which is a topic in signal processing and information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
