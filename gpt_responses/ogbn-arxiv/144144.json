The paper proposes a new method for NER that extends the use of dictionaries and improves mention boundary detection. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related areas. Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), as these sub-categories also cover topics related to NLP and machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
