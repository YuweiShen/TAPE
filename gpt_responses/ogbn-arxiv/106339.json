The use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) also suggests the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The analysis of a large patient population and the high accuracy achieved by the model may also relate to the medical imaging (cs.MS) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning for classification tasks is a common theme in the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
