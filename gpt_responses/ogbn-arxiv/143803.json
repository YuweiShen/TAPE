The descriptor is evaluated on a number of different tasks, including image retrieval and object recognition, which are typically associated with computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of whitening of the descriptor space, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of unsupervised learning to construct the descriptor, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the semantic meaning of the whitening on patch similarity, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper evaluates the descriptor on a number of different datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
