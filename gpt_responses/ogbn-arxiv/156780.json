Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel framework for incremental residual learning, which involves training a set of branches sequentially, and predicting the residuals of all previous branches combined. This framework involves machine learning techniques, which suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper involves extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
