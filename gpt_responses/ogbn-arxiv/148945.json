The paper proposes two model-based algorithms that leverage a model to predict future gradients to speed up policy learning. This topic is closely related to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), control systems (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
