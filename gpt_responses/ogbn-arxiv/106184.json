This suggests that computer vision techniques are being used to solve the problem. \n3. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - The paper discusses the issue of irrelevant text in trademarks affecting retrieval methods, which is a language-related problem. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The authors use machine learning techniques, specifically deep learning, to solve the trademark retrieval problem. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - Trademarks often include images and logos, which are multimedia objects. The use of computer vision techniques to retrieve trademarks suggests that this paper could also be relevant to the multimedia subfield."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
