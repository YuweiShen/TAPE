Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of feed-forward deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which falls under the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The optimization strategy proposed in the paper involves training the CNN on basic level object categorization before training on subordinate level categorization, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the link between the proposed optimization strategy and the human visual cortex, which could fall under the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
