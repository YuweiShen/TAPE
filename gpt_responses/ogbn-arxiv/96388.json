This falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the Walsh transform, which is a tool commonly used in information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper presents new results about specific permutations, which could fall under the category of data structures (cs.DS) or computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
