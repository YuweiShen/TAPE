This involves signal acquisition modeling and uncertainty estimation, which are common topics in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses numerical experiments and validation, which could fall under information theory (cs.IT) or neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the application of the proposed method is in fetal MRI, which could be categorized under bioinformatics (cs.BIO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
