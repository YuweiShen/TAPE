The paper also proposes a new theory on the role of awareness and universal context in neural networks, which could be relevant to the subfield of cognitive computing (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed theory in modelling human behaviour, which could be relevant to the subfield of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
