The paper also discusses the challenges of computation and memory consumption, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The proposed method involves an evolutionary algorithm, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method in terms of parameters and FLOPs, which suggests that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves experiments with image data, which suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
