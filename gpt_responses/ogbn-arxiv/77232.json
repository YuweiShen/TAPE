The paper also discusses optimization and compression techniques for the network, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of the detector in automotive safety suggests a possible connection to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses the trade-off between accuracy and memory usage, which could be relevant to computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
