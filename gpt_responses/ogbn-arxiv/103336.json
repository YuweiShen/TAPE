The paper uses mathematical models and analysis to characterize buffer starvation and proposes approaches to obtain the exact distribution of the number of buffer starvations. The paper also discusses the application of starvation analysis to optimize objective quality of experience (QoE) of media streaming. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.PF (Performance)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
