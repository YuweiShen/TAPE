The proposed method involves the use of weight matrices to suppress noise, which is related to information theory (cs.IT). The paper also mentions enforcing spatial smoothness, which is a common technique in graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the paper uses a Retinex model, which is a popular method in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
