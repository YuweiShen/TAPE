The proposed algorithm is based on cooperative game theory (cs.GT) and the CPs' utility function is used to optimize their individual profit, which is a topic related to networked systems (cs.NI) and control engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which is a topic related to computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
