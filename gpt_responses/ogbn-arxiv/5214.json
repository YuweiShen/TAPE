The paper also considers the physical layer functional split between the central unit (CU) and radio units (RUs), which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper proposes optimization algorithms based on stochastic successive upper bound minimization (SSUM), which is a technique used in machine learning and optimization (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of fronthaul compression and precoding on interference management and information overhead, which are relevant to communication and networking (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
