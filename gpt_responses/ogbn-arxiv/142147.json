This suggests that the paper belongs to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes an external memory algorithm, which involves efficient use of disk I/O, indicating that it could also belong to the Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) sub-category. The paper also mentions the computation of maximal repeats, which is a problem in combinatorics and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of scan-based algorithms suggests that the paper could also belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms, which could indicate that the paper belongs to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
