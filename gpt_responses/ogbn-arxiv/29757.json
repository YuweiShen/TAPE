The use of deep learning methods such as fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and deep residual architectures also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of medical images and the focus on glaucoma detection suggests that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the iterative nature of the proposed method and the use of training data to optimize the learning process suggests that it could belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
