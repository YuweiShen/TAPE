It may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as it proposes a novel algorithm for sparse convolution and leverages sparsity structure. Additionally, it may belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category as it deals with deep convolutional neural networks. Finally, it may belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as it applies the proposed method to LiDAR-based 3D object detection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
