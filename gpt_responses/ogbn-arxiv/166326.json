The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) in the analysis of security definitions and constructions of protocols. The use of hashing functions and constructions of authentication schemes suggest the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also deals with quantum information (cs.QI) in the context of quantum adversaries and quantum state authentication. Finally, the paper involves software engineering (cs.SE) in the design and implementation of authentication protocols."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
