Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related topics. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) as it deals with online sources such as company intranet and the World Wide Web. Hence, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also involves artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning for text processing, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. The paper also involves evaluation of the proposed method, which makes cs.LG (Learning) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves deep learning techniques for text processing, which makes cs.DL (Machine Learning) another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
