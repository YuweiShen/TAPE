It leverages the parallel capabilities of Spark to provide a high degree of data independence. The paper discusses how to map JSONiq expressions to Spark transformations on RDDs and how to map JSONiq FLWOR clauses to Spark SQL on DataFrames. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DB (databases), cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), and cs.IR (information retrieval). Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the system, which suggests that it could also be relevant to cs.LG (machine learning) and cs.SE (software engineering) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
