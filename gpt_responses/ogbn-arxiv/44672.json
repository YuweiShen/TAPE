The proposed algorithm is based on image processing techniques and aims at being resource-saving, which suggests a focus on efficiency and practical applications. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). However, the paper also addresses challenges related to human factors (e.g. make-up, non-centered eye recording), which suggests a potential interest in human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and machine learning (cs.LG). Moreover, the proposed algorithm is evaluated on a large dataset of hand-labeled images, which suggests a potential interest in multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
