These are all topics related to natural language processing, which falls under the cs.CL category.\n\n2. cs.SD (Sound): The paper focuses on speech processing, which is a subfield of sound processing. The development of tools for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, voice activity detection, and keyword spotting also fall under this category.\n\n3. cs.LG (Learning): The paper mentions the use of machine learning techniques for some of the speech processing tasks, such as speaker diarization and automatic speech transcription. This falls under the cs.LG category.\n\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of machine learning techniques for speech processing also falls under the cs.AI category.\n\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper mentions the release of a high-quality studio speech corpus under an open license, which could be used as a reference for studies in phonetics and pronunciation. This falls under the cs.SI category, as it involves the sharing of resources and information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
