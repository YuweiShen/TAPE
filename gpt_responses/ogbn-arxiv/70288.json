The paper focuses on classification tasks, which are typically covered in the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and cryptography and security (cs.CR). However, since the paper deals with learning from noisy data, it could also be relevant to other sub-categories such as data mining (cs.DM) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Among these sub-categories, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely ones since the paper proposes a novel learning system for multi-class classification using deep neural networks. The other sub-categories are also relevant since the paper uses benchmark-simulated and real-world noisy-label datasets to evaluate the proposed method, which are common in computer vision, natural language processing, and cryptography and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
