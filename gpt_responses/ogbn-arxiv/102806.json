The paper also uses market equilibria and stable polynomials, which are common tools in computational social choice (cs.DS) and algorithmic mechanism design (cs.EC). The problem of allocating items to agents also has applications in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
