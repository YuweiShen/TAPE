These are all computer vision tasks, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper focuses on the use of deep learning techniques, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also involves the estimation of two components of the target signals, which suggests that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category, as it deals with image and video processing tasks. Finally, the paper may belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category, as it involves the generation of visual content."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
