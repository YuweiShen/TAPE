This makes it likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), Signal Processing (cs.SP), and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses extensions of the results to other evolution equations, which could potentially place it in the Scientific Computing (cs.SC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
