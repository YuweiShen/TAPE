The use of deep neural networks for facial recognition also suggests that the paper may fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) category. The paper also discusses the use of wireless identifiers, which could potentially fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) or networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the issue of noisy and weak supervisory labels, which could potentially fall under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
