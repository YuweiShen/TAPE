The paper also discusses the use of chemoattractant and chemorepellent gradients to stimulate growth, movement, and network minimization, which suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the mechanisms in developing methods of spatially programming parallel unconventional computers and robotic devices, which suggests a focus on social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
