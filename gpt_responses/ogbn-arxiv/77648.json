It also involves the transmission of streaming sources, which is related to networked systems (cs.NI). The paper presents an explicit construction for the code, which involves algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The code is designed to handle burst and arbitrary erasures, which is a problem in signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with optimizing the rate of transmission, which is a topic in computer communications (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
