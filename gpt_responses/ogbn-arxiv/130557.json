The use of submodular valuations suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of submodular optimization (cs.DS). The development of approximation algorithms involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of combinatorial algorithms and multilinear extensions suggests that the paper may also be relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
