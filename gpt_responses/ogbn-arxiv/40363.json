The paper also mentions issues of distributed optimization, which could fall under the cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) category. The use of predictive control and stochastic uncertainties could also suggest a connection to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) categories. Finally, the paper may also relate to the cs.PL (Programming Languages) category, as it discusses the lack of common vocabulary between the control and power systems communities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
