The proposed framework involves deep neural networks, which suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and sound (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
