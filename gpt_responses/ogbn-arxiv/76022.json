The proposed measure is based on evaluating structural similarities between the saliency map and ground-truth map, which involves analyzing the regions and objects in the scene, indicating a possible connection to machine learning (cs.AI) and machine perception (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the use of meta-measures to evaluate the proposed measure, which suggests a possible connection to machine learning and data mining (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
