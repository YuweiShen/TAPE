Additionally, the paper proposes a new formulation of the nonlocal block that allows for deeper nonlocal structures, which is a topic that is closely related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the nature of diffusion and damping effect of nonlocal networks, which suggests that it may be relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper makes connections between the proposed nonlocal network and other nonlocal models, such as nonlocal diffusion process and Markov jump process, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
