It addresses the joint design of the hybrid backhaul links and the access links, which are crucial components of CRAN. The paper formulates the hybrid backhaul and access link design problem by minimizing the total network power consumption. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Augmented Reality (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
