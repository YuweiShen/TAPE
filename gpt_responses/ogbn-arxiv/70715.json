The use of deep neural networks suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) category. The paper also deals with the ambiguity of relevance labels, which is a common issue in natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the proposed method involves sampling techniques, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
