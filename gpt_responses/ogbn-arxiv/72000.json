This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The use of massive MIMO technology is a key aspect of the paper, which makes it relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a new transmission protocol that improves the performance of multi-way massive MIMO, which could be of interest to the sub-category of computer communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
