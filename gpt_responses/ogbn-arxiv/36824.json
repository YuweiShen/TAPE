The paper also discusses signal processing (cs.SP) and machine learning (cs.MM) techniques for sparse sensing and sampling. The use of state-dependent channels suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of statistical learning (cs.SI). Finally, the paper derives tight bounds on information rates and performance, which is a common theme in theoretical computer science (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
