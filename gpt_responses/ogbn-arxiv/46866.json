The paper also discusses a learning algorithm for the network, which involves self-organization and plasticity, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the network's ability to perform relational inference, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY).
