The agents are also goal-directed and operate in an environment, which suggests a connection to robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also presents actual software implementations, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
