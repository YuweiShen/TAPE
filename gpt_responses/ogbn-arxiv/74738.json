The proposed algorithm involves dividing the search space into sub-spaces, which could also be relevant to the subfield of logic in computer science (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL). The use of iterative successor computations suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI), while the focus on scalability and efficiency could also be relevant to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
