The paper also presents a formal theory for specifying and verifying distributed systems, which involves logical reasoning and theorem proving (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a semi-automatic theorem prover, which falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the correctness of system components, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE).
