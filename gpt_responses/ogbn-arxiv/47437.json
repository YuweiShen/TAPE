The use of one-bit measurements and the focus on positive and unlabeled examples suggest that the paper may belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The consideration of recommender systems and social networks also suggests a possible connection to data science (cs.DS) and social informatics (cs.SI). Finally, the use of optimization procedures and the mention of sample complexity suggest a possible connection to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
