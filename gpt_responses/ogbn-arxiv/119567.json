This falls under the category of Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networked Systems (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a sparsifying precoder, which is related to Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses feedback overhead and delay, which is relevant to Signal Processing (cs.SP). Finally, the paper mentions compressed sensing, which is a technique used in Information Theory (cs.IT) and Signal Processing (cs.SP)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
