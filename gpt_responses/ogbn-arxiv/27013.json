The paper discusses a new modular variant of extractive QA that focuses on building a standalone representation of the document discourse, which is a key research goal in machine reading comprehension. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the arXiv CS sub-categories that are related to natural language processing (NLP), such as cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, since the paper also discusses the scalability advantage of the proposed method, it may also belong to the sub-categories related to information retrieval (IR) and neural networks (NE), such as cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
