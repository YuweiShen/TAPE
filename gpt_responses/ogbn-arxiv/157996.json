This is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the tendency of CNNs to learn surface statistical regularities of the dataset, which is related to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of Fourier filtering to construct datasets is a signal processing technique, which is relevant to the field of neural engineering (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the recognition of objects, which is a topic in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
