Specifically, the paper focuses on the complexity of computing minimal unidirectional covering sets, which is a problem that can be formulated in terms of data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), game theory (cs.GT), and logic (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
