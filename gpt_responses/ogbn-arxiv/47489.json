The proposed technique involves embedding and aggregation of descriptors, which are common techniques in information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques for training and testing, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper presents experimental results and comparisons with existing state-of-the-art approaches, which suggests a focus on evaluation and performance analysis, possibly falling under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
