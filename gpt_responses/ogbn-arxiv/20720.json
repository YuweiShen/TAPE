This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as well as machine learning (cs.LG) since the proposed solution involves a discriminative model implemented as a neural network. The use of network sensors such as proxy servers and firewalls also suggests a sub-category of network and internet security (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper mentions the automatic learning of server types, which could fall under the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
