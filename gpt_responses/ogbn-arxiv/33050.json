Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper proposes a new objective function to improve the performance of captioning models, which involves machine learning techniques. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of the current approach and proposes a new method to address them, which involves information retrieval (IR) techniques. Therefore, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
