Additionally, the paper addresses occlusion estimation and handling, which is a common problem in robotics (cs.RO). The paper also introduces a novel method for incorporating information from past frames, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on two popular datasets commonly used in multimedia research (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
