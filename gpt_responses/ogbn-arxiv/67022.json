The approach also heavily relies on visual perception and tracking, which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as another likely sub-category. The paper also involves human-robot interaction and user evaluation, which could fall under human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper proposes novel algorithms for policy learning, which is a sub-field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
