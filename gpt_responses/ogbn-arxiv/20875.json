This involves rewarding agents for having causal influence over other agents' actions, which leads to enhanced coordination and communication in challenging social dilemma environments. The paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
