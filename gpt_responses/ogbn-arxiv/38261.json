The proposed method involves learning shared visual characteristics across object classes, which is a task that involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions using a separate encoder to learn these characteristics, which is a technique commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
