This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The algorithm is designed to reduce complexity, which could also be relevant to the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The use of thresholds to classify the reliability of received information bits and channel quality could be related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) or computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the focus on achieving low complexity could also be relevant to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
