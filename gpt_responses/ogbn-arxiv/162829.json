The use of the Mellin transform method for the asymptotic expansion of integrals suggests a connection to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and mathematical software (cs.MS). The optimization of the constrained capacity of a bank of parallel independent coherent fading channels driven by arbitrary discrete inputs may also involve the use of algorithms and optimization techniques, which could be relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
