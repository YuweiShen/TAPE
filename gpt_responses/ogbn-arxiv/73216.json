The paper proposes a method for providing safety guarantees, which suggests that it may also belong to the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of mixed integer programming and the need for scalable analysis techniques suggest that the paper may also belong to the categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
