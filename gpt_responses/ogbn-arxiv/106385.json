The paper also mentions differential privacy, which is a popular framework for achieving privacy in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the overhead required to achieve privacy in different models of classification and regression, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also proposes a baseline approach for ensuring privacy, which involves training several models on disjoint subsets of data, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper discusses the use of private aggregation techniques, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
