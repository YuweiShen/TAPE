Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of discursive and perceptual context, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, making cs.AI a likely sub-category as well. The model proposed in the paper also involves handling diverse phenomena, which could fall under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Learning) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Finally, the paper's focus on reference resolution could also make it relevant to the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
