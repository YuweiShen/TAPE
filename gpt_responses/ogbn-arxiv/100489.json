The paper also introduces a new technique called Adversarial Self-Play (ASP), which involves adversarial training and can be applied to various domains, such as robotics (cs.RO), machine learning (cs.LG), and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses theoretical analysis of the policy space and the circumstances under which ASP offers the greatest benefits, which falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
