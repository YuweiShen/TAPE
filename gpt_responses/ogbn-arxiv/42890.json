It also involves the use of offline computation and real-time adaptation, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The paper introduces the concept of meta-planning, which involves decision-making and optimization, making it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of sensor measurements and real-time adaptation suggests the involvement of machine learning and pattern recognition (cs.LG), and the use of a quadrotor suggests the involvement of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
