The method is based on a dynamic basis approach and uses isometric log-ratio transformation to model and predict gradual monotonous changes in a distribution. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.ST (Statistics), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
