Additionally, the use of pre-screening algorithms and lesion detectors suggests the involvement of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The proposed feature extraction approach also indicates the use of statistical and machine learning methods (cs.LG). The use of experimental results suggests the involvement of statistical computing (cs.MS) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
