The paper proposes a new algorithm that approximates the $\\ell_0$ norm with a series of concave functions, and provides theoretical analyses and numerical simulations to support its performance. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT, cs.LG, and cs.SP, followed by cs.NA and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
