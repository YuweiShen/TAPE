Additionally, the paper proposes a novel class of graph neural networks for modeling non-local context relations, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of a latent space to reduce the complexity of the graph suggests that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the experimental evaluations on visual recognition tasks suggest that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
