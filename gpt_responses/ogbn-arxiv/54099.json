The paper proposes a procedure to train multi-domain, Recurrent Neural Network-based (RNN) language generators, which involves multiple adaptation steps. This involves leveraging existing resources and exploiting similarities between domains to facilitate domain adaptation, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also evaluates the proposed procedure using corpus-based evaluation results, which is related to speech and dialogue processing (cs.SD) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
