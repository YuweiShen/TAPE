The paper explores how to generate collective amoeboid movement from simple non-oscillatory component parts, which is a topic related to multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the morphological adaptation and robustness of the collective, which are topics related to systems and control (cs.SY) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the potential of such material approaches to the field, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
