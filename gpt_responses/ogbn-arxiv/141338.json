The paper also introduces a novel temporal loss function, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to improve the performance of deep-learning models. Finally, the paper uses a super-resolution method with a truncation approach, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NEURON) to adapt the size of the generated positions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
