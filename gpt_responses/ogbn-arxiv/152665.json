It proposes a wiretap channel model for the finite-length regime and derives a novel RF (broadcast) satellite wiretap channel model. The paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed design using practical error correcting codes in current standards of satellite communication. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves system design and evaluation, which makes cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
