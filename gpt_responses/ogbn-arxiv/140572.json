The use of novel frame structure and signaling procedure also suggests a networking focus. \n\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the use of hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) and round trip time (RTT), which are concepts related to information theory. \n\n3. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) - The lab trial may have involved the use of specialized hardware to achieve the ultra-low latency, which would fall under the hardware architecture sub-category. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - Ultra-low latency is important for multimedia applications such as video streaming and online gaming, which may be a focus of this paper. \n\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The use of novel frame structure and signaling procedure may involve system design and control, which would fall under this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
