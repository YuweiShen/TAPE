This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) category. The paper also proposes a novel approach to optimizing the partial area under the ROC curve, which involves structured learning and could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the robustness of the detection process, which could be categorized under cryptography and security (cs.CR) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
