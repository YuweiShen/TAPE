This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with learning policies from expert demonstrations without access to a reward signal, which is a common problem in AI. The proposed framework and algorithm can be used to imitate complex behaviors in high-dimensional environments with multiple cooperative or competing agents.\n- cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper specifically deals with multi-agent settings and proposes a new framework for multi-agent imitation learning for general Markov games. The proposed algorithm is designed to work in non-stationary environments with multiple (Nash) equilibria.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The proposed framework and algorithm can be used to train agents in high-dimensional environments, which is relevant to robotics applications.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with learning policies for multiple agents in non-stationary environments, which is relevant to systems and control applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
