Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the use of algorithms to support time-varying data traffic loads and node mobility, which could fall under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The evaluation of the proposed approach involves real-world experiments and large-scale simulations, which could be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
