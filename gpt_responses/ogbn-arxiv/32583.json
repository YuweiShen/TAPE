The consideration of power constraints and the analysis of the limit of normalized capacity suggest a focus on network information theory (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). The extension of the results to a SISO channel with delay spread indicates a possible connection to multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
