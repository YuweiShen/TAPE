The use of heuristics to generate low-total-cost solutions also falls under the scope of AI. \n2. cs.RO - Robotics is another field that deals with multi-agent systems and path planning. The use of D*-lite in the low-level search of CBS is a common technique used in robotics. \n3. cs.MA - Multi-agent systems is a subfield of computer science that deals with the interaction of multiple agents in a shared environment. This paper deals with multi-agent path finding, which is a common problem in multi-agent systems. \n4. cs.SY - Systems and control theory deals with the analysis and design of systems that interact with their environment. Multi-agent systems can be seen as a type of system, and path planning is a common problem in control theory. \n5. cs.DS - Data structures and algorithms is a fundamental subfield of computer science that deals with the design and analysis of efficient algorithms. This paper proposes a new algorithm, MD-DCBS, to solve the lifelong multi-agent path finding problem with multiple delivery locations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
