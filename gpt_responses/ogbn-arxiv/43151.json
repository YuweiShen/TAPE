This makes it relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), and game theory (cs.GT). The paper also mentions that their algorithm extends previous work on multi-armed bandits, which further supports the relevance to machine learning and artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
