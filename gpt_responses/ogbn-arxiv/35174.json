It introduces hardware isolation to prevent attacks and incorporates a lightweight hardware check to detect potential attacks. \n2. cs.AR (Architecture) - The paper proposes a new multicore architecture that introduces spatial allocation of hardware resources across two concurrent domains to enable strong isolation. \n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper discusses the design and implementation of IRONHIDE, a new secure multicore architecture. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a new system architecture that leverages hardware isolation to mitigate microarchitecture state attacks. \n5. cs.OS (Operating Systems) - The paper proposes a new architecture that enables dynamic hardware isolation by reallocating core-level resources across clusters, which is relevant to operating system design."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
