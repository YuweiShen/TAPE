The paper proposes new algorithms for dualizing hypergraphs, which is a problem that is closely related to many other problems in computer science, such as minimal hitting set enumeration, set cover enumeration, and hypergraph transversals. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computational complexity (cs.CC), and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
