The focus is on an irregular, physically plausible three-dimensional (3D) small-world interconnect fabric that is inspired by modern network-on-chip paradigms. The paper discusses the design tradeoffs and properties of this interconnect fabric. The likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.ET (Emerging Technologies), cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.EM (Electromagnetics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
