The proposed approach involves a distributionally robust framework, which is a technique used in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of Semidefinite Programming relaxation, which is a mathematical optimization technique commonly used in computer science (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper involves the use of both theoretical and empirical analysis, which are common in the fields of neural networks and machine learning (cs.NE) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
