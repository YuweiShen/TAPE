The use of random matrices and their asymptotic eigenvalue distributions suggests a connection to numerical analysis (cs.NA). The application of statistical physics and the replica method suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the examples of applications in communication engineering suggest a connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
