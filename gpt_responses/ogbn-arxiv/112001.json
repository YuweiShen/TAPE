The paper also mentions the computational cost and the use of clusters, which are topics in computer science theory (cs.DS). The applications mentioned in the paper, such as protein sidechain placement and stereo problems, suggest computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY) as possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
