The paper also mentions wireless index coding, which falls under the category of coding theory (cs.IT). The discussion of heterogeneous settings with asymmetric multiple antenna configurations suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and communication engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the paper's title explicitly mentions \"cellular blind interference alignment,\" which further supports the likelihood of cs.NI and cs.SI (signal processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
