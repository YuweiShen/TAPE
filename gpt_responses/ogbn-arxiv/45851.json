Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses end-to-end optimization, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of Gaussian filters and dynamic inference suggests a focus on probabilistic modeling, which could place the paper in the category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions tuning locality to the data and task, which could fall under the category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper discusses improving efficiency, which could place it in the category of cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
