The paper also discusses the complexity of query answering under entity resolution, which involves algorithms and computational complexity (cs.AI, cs.DS). The paper uses a chase-like procedure, which is a common technique in logic and knowledge representation (cs.LG). Finally, the paper explores the frontier between tractability and intractability, which is a topic in computational complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
