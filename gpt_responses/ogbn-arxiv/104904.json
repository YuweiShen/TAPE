It also involves information theory (cs.IT) as the protocol's cost is measured in terms of the number of bits communicated. The use of composed functions and the study of their complexity is related to data structures (cs.DS) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the problem of separating complexity classes has connections to discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
