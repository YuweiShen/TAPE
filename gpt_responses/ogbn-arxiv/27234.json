The paper proposes a framework to approximate the output probability distribution induced by model posterior with a parameterized model and in an amortized fashion. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), systems and control (cs.SY), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
