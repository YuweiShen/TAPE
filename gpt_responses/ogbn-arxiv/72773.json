The paper proposes a novel approach called Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) and its variant Counterfactual Data Substitution (CDS) to remove gender bias from text corpora. This topic is closely related to several sub-fields of computer science, including computational linguistics (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), cybernetics (cs.CY), and social and information networks (cs.SI). Given the focus on NLP and ML, cs.CL and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.AI, which deals with the development of intelligent systems. The use of counterfactual data and name-based interventions also suggests a potential connection to cybernetics and social and information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
