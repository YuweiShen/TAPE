This involves image processing, computer vision, and machine learning techniques, which are all relevant to the computer science subfield of computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper focuses on human-computer interaction (HCI) in AR and VR environments, which falls under the subfield of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also mentions the use of videos and image sequences, which are relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) subfields. Finally, the paper discusses the recognition of ego hand gestures using embeddings, which is a technique commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
