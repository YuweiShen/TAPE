The use of relays and multiple-access channels suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The proposed scheme involves beamforming and interference alignment, which are techniques commonly used in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of artificial noise, which is a technique used in multimedia systems (cs.MM) to improve the quality of transmitted signals."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
