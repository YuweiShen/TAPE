It also proposes a new architecture that uses adaptive convolution to align features with anchors, which is a common technique in computer vision. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as it involves training a model to improve performance. The use of adaptive convolution may also suggest a connection to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the mention of code being made publicly available suggests a possible connection to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
