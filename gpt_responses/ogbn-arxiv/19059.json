The use of unsupervised machine learning and queuing theory also suggests that it could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of these techniques for traffic management also involves robotics and control systems (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
