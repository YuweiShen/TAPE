This suggests that the paper could belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) category. Additionally, the paper focuses on the implementation of CPS, which involves the integration of diverse distributed software modules, suggesting that it could also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) categories. The paper also discusses code generation frameworks and formal analysis, which are topics that could fall under Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
