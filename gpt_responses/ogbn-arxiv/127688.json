The use of normal bases and linear equations suggests a connection to algebraic structures and algorithms, which could fall under the categories of data structures (cs.DS) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the explicit representation of solutions could involve machine learning techniques, which could relate to the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
