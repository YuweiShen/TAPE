The proposed method involves the use of deep neural networks (cs.LG) and fully convolutional networks (cs.IR) for estimating the geometry attributes of text instances. The method also involves the use of flexible representations (cs.AI) to handle text of arbitrary shapes. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.IR, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
