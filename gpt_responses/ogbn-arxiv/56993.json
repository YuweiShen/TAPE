The paper also discusses the application of the error bound to time series generated by certain classes of dynamical models, which falls under the sub-category of statistics (cs.ST) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper deals with the analysis of non-independent training data, which is relevant to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
