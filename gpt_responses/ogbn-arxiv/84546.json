It could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it proposes a new approach to incorporate a structured inference module into non-autoregressive models. Additionally, the paper uses techniques from computer vision (such as convolutional neural networks) and natural language processing (such as conditional random fields) which could make it relevant to the sub-categories of cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
