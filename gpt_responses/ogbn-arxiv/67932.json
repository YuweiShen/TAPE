It also involves proof theory and declarative specifications, which are related to logic (cs.LO). The paper mentions the use of refinement types, which are commonly used in type systems for verification and formal methods (cs.TL). The paper also discusses algorithmic typing rules, which are related to formal languages and automata (cs.FL). Finally, the paper deals with technical innovations in proving soundness and completeness, which are related to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
