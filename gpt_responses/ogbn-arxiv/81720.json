This topic falls under the area of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as well as algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The use of semidefinite programming also involves linear algebra and optimization techniques, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper deals with graph problems such as stable set and maximum clique, which are part of the area of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
