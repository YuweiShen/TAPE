The paper also discusses the use of Reed-Solomon codes, which are commonly used in error-correcting codes (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes new code constructions, which could potentially fall under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI) if the codes are used in network communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
