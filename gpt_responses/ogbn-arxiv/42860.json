The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework for finding the optimal caching policy, which involves modeling user requests using Markov processes and taking into account cache-refreshing costs. This suggests that the paper could also be classified under machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the scalability of the proposed approach, which could fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY) or information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
