This involves the study of the information content of the transmitted symbols and their manipulation to improve the performance of the receiver. \n2. cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with the design of a receiver algorithm for a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) channel, which is a common topic in communication systems. The algorithm is designed to work with both common and separate oscillator configurations, which are important aspects of wireless communication systems. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with the design of a receiver algorithm for a SIMO channel, which involves the study of the system dynamics and control aspects of the receiver. The algorithm is designed to work with different oscillator configurations, which requires the study of the system behavior under different conditions. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with the design of a receiver algorithm for a wireless communication system, which is a common topic in networking and internet architecture. The algorithm is designed to work with different oscillator configurations, which are important aspects of wireless communication systems. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the manipulation of QAM modulated data symbols before"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
