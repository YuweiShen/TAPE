This involves selecting data points from the training sample that exhibit special characteristics crucial for explanation, deriving semantic concepts from the selected data points through the use of domain ontologies, and filtering and ranking these concepts to produce informative explanations that improve human understanding. The paper is therefore likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for constructing informative explanations for predictions made from machine learning models, which is a key area of research in AI. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper is focused on developing a method for explaining predictions made from machine learning models, which falls under the umbrella of machine learning research. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper involves deriving semantic concepts from data points through the use of domain ontologies, which is a key area of research in computational linguistics. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves filtering and ranking semantic concepts to produce informative explanations, which is a key area of research in information retrieval. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper is motivated by observations from social sciences, which suggests a potential connection to research on the societal impact of technology."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
