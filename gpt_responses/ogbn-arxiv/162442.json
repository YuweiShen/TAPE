This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as it involves concealing sensitive information. Additionally, the use of audio signals suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper also mentions features such as dynamic overlay routing and performance optimization, which are related to software-defined networking (cs.SD) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
