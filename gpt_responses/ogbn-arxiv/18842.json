This involves the use of machine learning techniques for discovering and representing causal interactions among subsystems of a complex system. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed framework involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques for root-cause analysis, specifically the sequential state switching and artificial anomaly association methods. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with root-cause analysis in distributed cyber-physical systems, which falls under the domain of systems and control. \n4. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a spatiotemporal feature extraction scheme for multivariate time series, which involves the use of neural networks for discovering causal interactions among subsystems. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with fault propagation mechanisms and causal interactions among subsystems of a complex system, which can be modeled as a network. This falls under the domain of social and information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
