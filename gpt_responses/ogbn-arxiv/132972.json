The problem involves making decisions based on limited information, which is a common theme in information theory (cs.IT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The algorithmic aspect of the problem and the use of bounds suggest that it could also be classified under data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
