The use of morphological analysis and rule-based dependency analysis to extract purchase information from tweet data suggests that it could belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The use of bipartite graph and clustering analysis suggests that it could belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.SD (Software Engineering). Finally, the focus on visualizing regional information suggests that it could belong to cs.SOC (Social and Behavioral Sciences)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
