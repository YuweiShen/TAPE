The use of the Limited Multi-Label (LML) projection layer is demonstrated on top-k CIFAR-100 classification and scene graph generation, which suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), or neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Among these, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely categories as they are directly related to the proposed method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
