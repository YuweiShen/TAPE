The paper also discusses the memory-rate trade-off, which is a fundamental concept in coding theory (cs.CC) and has applications in various fields such as communication networks and distributed storage systems. Finally, the paper presents a specific case study for the demand-private coded caching problem for $K=2$ users, $N=2$ files, which can be considered as a subfield of information theory and coding theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
