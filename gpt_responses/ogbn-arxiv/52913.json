The paper presents algorithms for computing tight sensitivity bounds for constructing smaller coresets, which is a problem in computational geometry and optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
