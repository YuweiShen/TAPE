The paper also discusses the use of these networks for image and point cloud data, which are subfields of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper's focus on developing new linear layers for graph data suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper's use of deep neural networks and message passing neural networks suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper's theoretical contributions to the field of equivariant deep learning suggest that it may also be relevant to the subfield of machine learning theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
