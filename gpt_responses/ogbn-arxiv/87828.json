The paper specifically focuses on deep neural networks (DNNs), which are a subset of ANNs commonly used in computer vision tasks. Therefore, cs.NE (neural and evolutionary computing) is also a likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses techniques from information theory to study the strength of network connections during training, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and statistical learning (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
