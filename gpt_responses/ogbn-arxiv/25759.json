The use of multiple anonymized views and the computational cost trade-off suggest a possible connection to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB). Finally, the experimental evaluation and comparison of different anonymization techniques may involve machine learning (cs.LG) methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
