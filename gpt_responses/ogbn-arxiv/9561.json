It proposes a machine reading task for building a representation of the conversation and presents an end-to-end trainable machine reading algorithm called Attentive Memory Network (AMN). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is Information Retrieval (cs.IR), followed by Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, which suggests that it may be relevant to Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
