The authors present three control strategies to achieve this, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Systems and Control sub-category. \n2. cs.ME (Mechanical Engineering): The paper mentions physical and technological constraints occurring in experimental microfluidic platforms, which suggests that it may also belong to the Mechanical Engineering sub-category. \n3. q-bio.QM (Quantitative Methods): The paper uses stochastic agent-based simulations to validate the designed controllers, which suggests that it may also belong to the Quantitative Methods sub-category. \n4. q-bio.TO (Tissues and Organs): The paper deals with regulating the ratio of two cell populations, which may be relevant to the Tissues and Organs sub-category. \n5. q-bio.SC (Subcellular Processes): The paper mentions a genetic toggle switch as an example of a bistable memory mechanism, which may be relevant to the Subcellular Processes sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
