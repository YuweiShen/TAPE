The paper proposes a novel method for automatic detection of media genre and show identities using acoustic features, textual features or a combination thereof. The use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation to model both acoustics and text, and the use of Support Vector Machines based classification, suggests that this paper could belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): This sub-category deals with the processing, analysis, and retrieval of multimedia data, which is the main focus of this paper. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category deals with the retrieval of information from large collections of data, which is a key aspect of multimedia indexing. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with the intersection of computer science and linguistics, which is relevant to the use of textual features in this paper. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the development of algorithms that can learn from data, which is relevant to the use of Support Vector Machines in this paper. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category deals with the analysis and interpretation of visual data, which is not the main focus of this paper but could be relevant to the use of acoustic features."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
