This involves the use of deep neural networks and recurrent neural networks to learn update rules and gradient approximations. The paper also includes experiments on synthetic and practical optimization tasks, including black-box adversarial attacks. Based on these factors, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
