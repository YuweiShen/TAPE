The paper focuses on identifying vectors with large Pearson correlation, but the results extend to other similarity measures. The paper proposes an indexing data structure that is a recursive, data-dependent partitioning of vectors inspired by recent advances in set similarity search. The paper also analyzes the set similarity problem under a random data model that reflects the kind of skewed data distributions seen in practice. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.DB (Databases), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
