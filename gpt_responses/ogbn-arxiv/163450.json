The approach is based on recurrent neural networks, which are a type of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) technique. The paper also discusses the use of force sensors and safety considerations, which are relevant to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of neural networks to capture nonlinear factors suggests a connection to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
