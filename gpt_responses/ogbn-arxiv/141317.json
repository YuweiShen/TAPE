The use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with LSTM architecture suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The proposed view adaptation scheme involves adapting to the most suitable observation viewpoints, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of skeleton data suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of RNNs suggests that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
