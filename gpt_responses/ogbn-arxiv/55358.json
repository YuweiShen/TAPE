Additionally, the use of deep learning architectures is a common approach in this field. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as semantic parsing is a subfield of AI and the paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture for this task. \n\ncs.LG (Machine Learning) is another likely sub-category as the paper makes use of neural models for language semantics. \n\ncs.IR (Information Retrieval) is a possible sub-category as the paper deals with generating ontology-specific queries from natural language statements and questions, which is a task related to information retrieval. \n\nFinally, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a possible sub-category as the paper proposes a deep learning architecture for semantic parsing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
