The paper also uses simulated multi-neuronal data from a Poisson model, which is a common approach in the field of computational neuroscience.\n\nThe paper also involves the use of Temporal Data Mining (TDM) methods, which are commonly used in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The Frequent Episode Discovery framework used in the paper is a form of pattern mining, which is also a common topic in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category.\n\nThe paper also deals with the functional connectivity between neuronal populations, which is a topic in the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category. Finally, the paper presents a method to assess the statistical significance of the discovered episodes, which is a topic in the cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
