Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also uses convolutional neural networks, which are a popular deep learning architecture, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely categories as well. The paper also deals with information retrieval from clinical notes, which could make cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a possible category. Finally, the paper uses MLPs for prediction, which could make cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
