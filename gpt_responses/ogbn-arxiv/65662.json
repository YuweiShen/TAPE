This involves understanding the relevancy of contexts, discovery of useful behavioral rules of individuals and their ordering, knowledge-based interactive post-mining for semantic understanding, and dynamic updating and management of rules according to their present behavior. These issues are related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC), information retrieval (cs.IR), database systems (cs.DB), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and social and information networks (cs.SI).
