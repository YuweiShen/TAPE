The paper involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques to generate suitable and secure covers for steganography. The paper also involves cryptography (cs.CR) as it aims to provide secure steganography. Additionally, the paper involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it utilizes a sophisticated steganalysis network for the discriminative network. Finally, the paper involves multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with image quality and visual evaluation of the generated images."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
