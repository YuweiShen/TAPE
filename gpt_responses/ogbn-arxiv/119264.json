This is relevant to social and information networks, which often require efficient data transmission. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses multi-level modulations, which are commonly used in multimedia applications. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes signal processing algorithms for minimizing the required power under per-user SINR or goodput constraints, which could potentially involve machine learning techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
