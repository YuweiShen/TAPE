This involves image processing and computer vision techniques such as 2D/3D registration and automatic detection of fiducials. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The proposed method is intended for use in periacetabular osteotomy surgeries, which involve cutting and repositioning of bone fragments. This is a surgical robotics application that requires accurate and fast pose estimation of the fragments. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper involves the use of fluoroscopy images and CT scans for pose estimation, which are types of medical multimedia data. \n4. cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper describes the use of mathematical algorithms and software for 2D/3D registration and pose estimation of the bone fragments. \n5. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): Although not directly related to multi-agent systems, the proposed method involves the use of multiple fiducials implanted in different parts of the pelvis, which can be seen as multiple agents that need to be tracked and registered in 3D space."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
