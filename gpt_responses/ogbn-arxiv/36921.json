The topic of abstractive summarization falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP), which is typically classified under cs.CL. The use of RL and alternative evaluation measures also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper mentions improvements in automated metrics, which could indicate a focus on neural networks (cs.NE) commonly used in NLP tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
