The proposed method utilizes a pre-trained object detection model, which involves deep learning techniques (cs.LG). The method also involves unsupervised learning, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on two public datasets, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of supervised label information also involves machine learning techniques (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
