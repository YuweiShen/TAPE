The method involves parameter decomposition and updating only task-specific parameters, which are factorized into sparse low-rank matrices. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision)\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language)\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
