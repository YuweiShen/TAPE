The paper also discusses incorporating partial information from different data sources, which is a common problem in information retrieval and data integration (cs.SI). The paper uses boosting-inspired techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with community detection, which is a subfield of data science (cs.DS) and graph theory (cs.DB). Overall, the paper's focus on learning graph representations from weak feedback makes it relevant to several subfields of computer science, but the most likely categories are cs.LG, cs.SI, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
