The use of guillotine subdivisions and PTAS algorithms suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category covers research on the design and analysis of efficient algorithms and data structures for solving computational problems. The paper's focus on PTAS algorithms and their analysis makes it a good fit for this sub-category. \n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms and data structures for geometric problems, such as geometric optimization, geometric data analysis, and geometric modeling. The TSP with neighborhoods is a classic problem in computational geometry, and the use of guillotine subdivisions is a common technique in this field. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers research on the theory and applications of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics. The TSP with neighborhoods is a relevant problem in robotics and logistics, and the paper's focus on approximation algorithms may be of interest to researchers in this area. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers research on the theory and applications of machine learning, including deep learning, reinforcement learning, and statistical learning.
