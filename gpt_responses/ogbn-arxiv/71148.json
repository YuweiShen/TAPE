The use of optical systems and the focus on undersampling also suggest the Signal Processing and Information Theory sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of linear equations for signal reconstruction, which falls under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the robustness of the proposed scheme to noise, which is a common concern in the Signal Processing and Information Theory sub-categories, as well as the Systems and Control (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
