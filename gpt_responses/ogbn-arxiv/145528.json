This involves computer vision (CV) techniques for analyzing the skeleton-based motion dynamics, machine learning (ML) techniques for feature extraction and recognition, and human-computer interaction (HCI) for evaluating the robustness of the proposed framework. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves attention-driven residues for enhancing the performance of residual components, which falls under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of deep learning techniques for feature extraction and recognition also falls under the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The evaluation of the proposed framework on challenging datasets involves multimedia (MM) techniques for processing and analyzing videos. Finally, the evaluation of the robustness of the proposed framework involves human-computer interaction (HCI) techniques. Therefore, the other likely sub-categories are cs.MM and cs.HC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
