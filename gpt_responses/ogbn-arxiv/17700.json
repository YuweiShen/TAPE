Therefore, cs.AI and cs.LG are the most likely categories. The paper also involves theoretical analysis of the size of the compiled DNNFs, which could fall under cs.DS (data structures and algorithms) or cs.DM (discrete mathematics). Finally, the paper discusses practical experiments, which could fall under cs.CC (computational complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
