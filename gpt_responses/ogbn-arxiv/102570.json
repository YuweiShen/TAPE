These models are commonly used in computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of deep learning frameworks and compilers, which are commonly used in AI applications.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper explores the use of the Sunway many-core processor, which is a highly parallel architecture. The authors leverage the architecture features during compilation to generate efficient code for deep learning applications.\n- cs.PF (Performance): The paper focuses on generating efficient code for deep learning applications on the Sunway architecture. The authors compare the performance of their automatically generated code with hand-optimized OpenACC implementations.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper proposes swTVM, an extension of the TVM deep learning compiler, to support ahead-of-time compilation for architectures requiring cross-compilation such as Sunway. The authors leverage the architecture features during compilation to generate efficient code for deep learning applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
