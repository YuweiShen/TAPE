This involves using annotated MultiNet graphs to represent natural language expressions and selecting relevant similarity measures. The paper also discusses integrating this approach into an existing framework for answer validation and reranking. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval), as the paper deals with natural language processing and information retrieval. The paper also discusses machine learning techniques, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of a case base, which could be related to databases, making cs.DB (Databases) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of ranking models, which could be related to machine learning and optimization, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
