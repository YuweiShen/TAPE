The use of annotations and contracts also suggests a focus on formal methods and logic (cs.LO). The approach involves memoization, which is a technique commonly used in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents the approach in the context of a specific run-time checking framework, which suggests a focus on systems and software engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
