The paper proposes two algorithms for quickly computing upper bounds on the risk of collision between a robot and uncertain obstacles. This problem is closely related to robotics (cs.RO), as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of convex decomposition, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
