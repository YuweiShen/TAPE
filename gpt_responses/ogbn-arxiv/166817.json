This topic is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and logic (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper's focus on the formal semantics of negation and rule application makes it relevant to database systems (cs.DB) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the investigation of the benefits of this extension could also be of interest to the subfield of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
