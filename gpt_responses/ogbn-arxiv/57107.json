This suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Signal Processing (cs.SP) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a low-complexity algorithm, which may be of interest to researchers in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper deals with interference and noise, which suggests that it may belong to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a technique for estimating the covariance matrix, which may be of interest to researchers in the Statistical Learning (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
