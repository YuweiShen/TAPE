The approach presented in the paper involves using unlabeled data to learn generalizable face representations, which is a problem of unsupervised learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates its approach on unconstrained datasets, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and computer security and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
