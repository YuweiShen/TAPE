It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as the task of object pose estimation is relevant to robotics applications. The use of deep learning methods suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the use of geometric constraints and optimization techniques may suggest that it belongs to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
