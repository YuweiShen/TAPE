This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper also proposes ways to make models more robust against spurious correlations, which falls under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the paper uses automated semantic image manipulations and tests for consistency in model predictions, which could also fall under the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
