This falls under the scope of systems and control, making cs.SY the most likely category.\n\n2. cs.EM (Embedded Systems): The paper discusses the implementation of digital linear filters in software and hardware, which is a common topic in embedded systems research.\n\n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a compositional, effective abstraction for digital linear filters expressed as block diagrams, which is a software engineering technique.\n\n4. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the use of fixed-point or floating-point implementations of digital linear filters, which is a programming language concern.\n\n5. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper proposes a method for static analysis of digital linear filters, which involves reasoning about the behavior of the filters using logical techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
