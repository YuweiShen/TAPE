The framework is applied to physical domains involving fluids, rigid solids, and deformable materials interacting with one another, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV) or systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses hyperparameter choices and error mitigation, which could be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
