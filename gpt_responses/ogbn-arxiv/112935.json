This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories. \n\ncs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely category as it deals with natural language processing and information extraction, which are the main focus of the paper. \n\ncs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is also a likely category as the paper deals with extracting attributes from visual depictions of entities. \n\ncs.IR (Information Retrieval) is another possible category as the paper deals with extracting structured information from unstructured data, which is a key problem in information retrieval. \n\ncs.MM (Multimedia) is a relevant category as the paper deals with multimodal data, which is a key focus of this sub-category. \n\ncs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a possible category as the paper proposes a weakly supervised approach to training attribute extractors, which is a key problem in machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
