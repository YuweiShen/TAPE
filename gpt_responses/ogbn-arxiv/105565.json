It may also fall under the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category as it discusses the wireless channel model and bandwidth efficiency. Additionally, it could be categorized under Graphics (cs.GR) as it deals with virtual reality and 360-degree scenes. Computer Vision (cs.CV) is also a possibility as it involves predicting the field-of-view of each user. Finally, Information Theory (cs.IT) may be relevant as the paper mentions using convex optimization to find a feasible solution."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
