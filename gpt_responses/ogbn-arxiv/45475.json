The model also employs a structured, multidimensional representation of student proficiencies, which could be related to computational education (cs.CE) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper mentions educational content, suggesting a potential connection to computer science education (cs.ED)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
