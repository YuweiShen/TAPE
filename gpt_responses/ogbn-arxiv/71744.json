The approach is based on KL divergence and employs a data-dependent partitions based KL divergence estimator. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with convergence rates and consistency of the estimator, which suggests that it could also belong to the Statistics (cs.ST) or Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. Finally, the paper compares the performance of the KL divergence based test with a recently introduced test based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), which suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.ML) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
