The proposed method involves signal processing on graphs, which is a subfield of applied mathematics and computer science (cs.MM). The paper also mentions navigation and heritage reconstruction, which are applications of point clouds in computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the optimization problem formulation and numerical methods used in the paper suggest a connection to numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
