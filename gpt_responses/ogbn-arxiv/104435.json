The proposed algorithm involves regularization, drop rule, and AdaBound, which are optimization techniques commonly used in neural networks and deep learning (cs.NE). The paper also proposes a rule-pruning algorithm, which is a technique commonly used in fuzzy systems and control theory (cs.SY, cs.FL).
