The paper also discusses the size of complete and complete bipartite graphs in these non-planar graph classes, which falls under the category of graph theory (cs.GT). The technique presented in the paper involves generating and analyzing large sets of graphs, which could be considered a problem in data structures (cs.DS) or algorithms (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
