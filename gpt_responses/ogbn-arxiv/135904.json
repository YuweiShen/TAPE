The paper also discusses behavioral biases, which falls under the category of computational economics (cs.CE). The smoothness method is a well-known technique in theoretical computer science, which is categorized under cs.DS. The paper also discusses cost functions, which are related to optimization and algorithms, falling under cs.SI. Finally, the paper discusses some initial implications for atomic congestion games, which is a subfield of game theory and falls under cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
