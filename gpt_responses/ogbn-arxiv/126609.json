The use of orthogonal cuts and the linear number of cuts suggest a connection to data structures (cs.DS). The concept of genus is a fundamental concept in topology, which is relevant to the study of graphs and networks (cs.GT). The algorithmic nature of the problem and the use of special leaves suggest a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper presents a new technique for unfolding polyhedra of higher genus, which could be of interest to researchers in the field of computational geometry and algorithms (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
