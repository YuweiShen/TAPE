Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of multi-ground truth evaluation method, which involves natural language processing techniques, making cs.CL (Computation and Language) another likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of deep learning models, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper involves the use of text recognition techniques, which falls under cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
