Therefore, cs.IT and cs.COMM are the most likely categories. The paper also proposes a novel reduced-complexity decoding scheme, which involves algorithmic optimization and data structure design, indicating that it may also belong to the categories of cs.DS and cs.SY. Finally, the paper focuses on the application of polar codes in mobile communication standards, suggesting that it may also belong to the category of cs.NI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
