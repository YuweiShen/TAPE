Additionally, the paper discusses the compression and expansion of distances in hidden-unit space, which is a common topic in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions language and learning as potential causes of categorical perception, which could place it in the sub-categories of Computation and Language (cs.CL) and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
