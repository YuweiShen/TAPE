This falls under the sub-category of Information Theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the use of negacyclic codes in cryptography, which could place it under the sub-category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of linear codes, which could place it under the sub-category of Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL). The paper also discusses the use of cosets, which could place it under the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions MDS codes, which could place it under the sub-category of Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
