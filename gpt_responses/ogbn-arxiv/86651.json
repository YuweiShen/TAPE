This involves the use of Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNN) and other state-of-the-art architectures. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category deals with the study of neural networks and their applications, which is the main focus of the paper. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data, which is also relevant to the paper. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category deals with the study of the transmission, processing, and utilization of information, which is relevant to the use of TEC maps in satellite telecommunications. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category deals with the study of systems and control theory, which is relevant to the use of TEC maps in GNSS and other space applications. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the study of intelligent agents and their applications, which is relevant to the use of DNNs in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
