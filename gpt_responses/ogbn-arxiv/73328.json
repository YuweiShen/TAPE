It also extends the proposal to the field of memetic algorithms, which is closely related to evolutionary computing. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories as genetic algorithms are commonly used in these fields. The paper may also be relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category as it proposes a new selection mechanism designed to preserve and take advantage of population diversity. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) category as it presents a new algorithm design that aims to improve the performance of genetic and memetic algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
