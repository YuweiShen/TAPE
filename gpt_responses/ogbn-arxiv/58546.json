The concept of locked and unlocked chains involves the analysis of the connectivity of configuration spaces, which is a topic in discrete mathematics and combinatorial optimization (cs.DS). The use of rotatable joints and the goal of characterizing families of planar shapes that admit certain properties suggest a connection to robotics (cs.RO) and control theory (cs.SI). Finally, the study of universal foldability involves the analysis of geometric structures and their properties, which is a topic in graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
