This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of genetic algorithms for optimization, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the need for efficient and compact architectures, which is relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category.
