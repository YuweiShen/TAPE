The use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the focus on modeling long-range dependencies in the spectral domain suggests that it may also belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the use of hyperspectral images for classification suggests that it may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
