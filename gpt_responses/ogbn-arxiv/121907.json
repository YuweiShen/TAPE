The use of the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) and its variants also suggests a connection to the subfield of hardness of approximation. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), cs.CC (computational complexity), and cs.CG (computational geometry). The problems studied in the paper also involve graph theory and optimization, which could make cs.GT (graph theory) and cs.SI (social and information networks) relevant sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
