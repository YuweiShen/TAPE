Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses techniques for reducing model size and increasing training speed, which are topics related to machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper mentions using a self-supervised loss for modeling inter-sentence coherence, which is a technique related to computer vision (CV) and sequence modeling. Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
