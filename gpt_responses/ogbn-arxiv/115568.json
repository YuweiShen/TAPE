The use of analog beamforming and receive combining structures also suggests a potential connection to signal processing (cs.SP). The paper also mentions the exploitation of angular spreads, which could be related to computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SP). Finally, the use of compressed sensing techniques suggests a connection to signal processing (cs.SP) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
