The paper also discusses the decay rates of feature map energy and provides estimates of the number of layers needed to contain a certain percentage of input signal energy. These topics are closely related to the fields of machine learning, computer vision, neural networks, artificial intelligence, and information theory, which are covered by the arXiv CS sub-categories cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.NE, cs.AI, and cs.IT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
