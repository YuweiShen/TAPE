This falls under the category of optimization and machine learning, which are covered by several sub-categories in arXiv CS. The use of heuristics and ensembling techniques suggests a focus on neural networks and deep learning, which are covered by cs.NE and cs.LG. The paper also discusses decision-making processes and exploration-exploitation tradeoffs, which are relevant to reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence, covered by cs.AI. The use of window-based temporal credit assignment and resource utilization suggests a focus on data structures and algorithms, covered by cs.DS. Finally, the paper proposes a generalizable approach that can be adapted to different types of limited computational resources, which suggests a focus on control systems and robotics, covered by cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
