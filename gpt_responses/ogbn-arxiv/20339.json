This makes the paper relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO), Programming Languages (cs.PL), Software Engineering (cs.SE), Logic and Verification (cs.LF), and Computation and Language (cs.CL). However, since the paper focuses on the syntactic conditions of the calculus, it is most likely to be classified under cs.LO, followed by cs.PL and cs.SE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
