The paper also discusses algorithms and complexity results, which are typical topics in the subfields of data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of under-approximations and conditions for constructing complete intersections suggests a connection to the area of logic and verification (cs.LO), while the focus on recognizing polyadic predicates on words suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
