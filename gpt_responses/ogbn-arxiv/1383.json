The proposed mechanism involves monitoring network traffic, which is a key aspect of network security (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, which are common techniques in data analysis and machine learning (cs.SI). The mechanism involves blocking traffic from attacking sources, which is a form of traffic engineering (cs.DC). Finally, the paper discusses the use of different detection modules with varying levels of computational and memory overheads, which is a common approach in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
