The paper introduces a technique to represent grids supporting aggregated range queries that requires little space when the data points in the grid are clustered, which is common in practice. This technique can be applied to several domains, including Geographic Information Systems and OLAP cubes, which are covered by cs.DB and cs.IR. The paper also discusses the efficient support for aggregated range queries, which is a topic covered by cs.DS and cs.CG. Finally, the paper presents experimental results that show the performance of the proposed technique, which is a topic covered by cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
