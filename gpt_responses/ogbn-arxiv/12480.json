Additionally, the use of deep learning techniques such as local segmentation networks and curve connection suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper may also be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) as text detection is often a crucial step in document analysis and retrieval. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to computational linguistics (cs.CL) as it deals with text segmentation and connection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
