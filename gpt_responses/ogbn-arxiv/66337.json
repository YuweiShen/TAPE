Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also deals with machine learning (ML) systems and model training, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper introduces a new measure of embedding instability, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions that the stability-memory tradeoffs extend to other types of embeddings, including contextual word embeddings, which could also place it under cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
