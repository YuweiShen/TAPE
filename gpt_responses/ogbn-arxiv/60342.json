The paper proposes a method to make Ensemble of Classifier Chains (ECC) resilient to class imbalance, which is a popular multi-label learning method. This topic is closely related to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
