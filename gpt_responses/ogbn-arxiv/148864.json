This involves the use of intelligent information technologies and web services, which are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science. Specifically, the paper mentions the development of a system for supporting research in the field of ontology engineering, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of web services and microservices also suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and databases (cs.DB). Finally, the paper discusses the automated preparation of application documents for patenting inventions, which could be related to digital libraries (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
