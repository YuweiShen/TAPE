The specific focus on decision making algorithms based on Markov decision processes suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of robotics (cs.RO). The use of empirical hardness models and numerical experiments suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the discussion of the design and implementation of autonomous systems suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
