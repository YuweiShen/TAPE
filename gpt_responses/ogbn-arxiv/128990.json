The use of neural networks for policy learning suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The transfer of policies from simulation to a real system involves system integration and control (cs.SY). Finally, the use of vision-based perception for locomotion tasks suggests a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
