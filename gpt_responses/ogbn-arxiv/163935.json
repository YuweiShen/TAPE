The modifications suggested to the AA-SIPP(m) planner involve lifting restrictive assumptions and providing robustness to the solutions, which are typical concerns in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The problem of multi-agent path finding is also a well-studied topic in the field of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Finally, the evaluation of the algorithm involves simulation and experiments with real robots, which are typical approaches in the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
