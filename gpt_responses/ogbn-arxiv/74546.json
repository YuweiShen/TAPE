The paper also leverages Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data, which falls under the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. The use of SfM techniques and machine learning algorithms for scene understanding suggests that the paper could also be classified under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also presents a pipeline for generating strong 3D geometric priors, which could be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of contextual constraints for re-scoring pedestrian detections, which could be relevant to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
