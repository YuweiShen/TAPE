Therefore, cs.IT is the most likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the performance evaluation of different modulation schemes for indoor visible light communication systems, which are a part of networking and internet architecture. Hence, cs.NI is also a likely sub-category.\n\n3. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper focuses on the performance comparison of different modulation schemes for indoor visible light communication systems, which are a part of communications and networking. Therefore, cs.COMM is another likely sub-category.\n\n4. cs.OH (Other Computer Science): The paper may also fall under the category of cs.OH as it deals with a specific application of computer science, i.e., visible light communication systems.\n\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the impact of LED nonlinearity on the performance of different modulation schemes for indoor visible light communication systems, which are a part of multimedia applications. Hence, cs.MM is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
