This involves capturing power losses and power flows in the full decision variable domain, combining these approximations to recast the nonlinear constraints of the OPF problem into linear ones, and solving the approximate OPF problem with off-the-shelf solvers in a non-iterative fashion. These techniques involve optimization, machine learning, and control theory, which are all relevant to the sub-categories of cs.SY, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.NE, and cs.DC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
