The paper specifically focuses on over-the-air computing (AirComp) for WDA in clustered IoT networks with multi-antenna sensors forming clusters and a multi-antenna access-point (AP) performing WDA. This involves designing multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) AirComp for computing a vector-valued function. The paper also discusses the need to reduce channel or signal dimensionality in AirComp to avoid exposure to noise from channel null-spaces. Based on this, the paper proposes a framework of reduced-dimension MIMO AirComp, featuring decomposed-aggregation-beamforming (DAB). The paper also discusses efficient algorithms for rank-optimization of individual DAB components and channel-feedback leveraging the AirComp principle. Given this focus on wireless-data-aggregation, MIMO, and dimensionality reduction, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses the use of efficient algorithms, which could place it in the cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
