Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers topics related to NLP and computational linguistics. The paper also involves training end-to-end models, which is a common topic in the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of data augmentation on the performance of the models, which is relevant to the sub-category of cs.SD (Software Engineering) that deals with software development and testing. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on two datasets, which is related to the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval) that focuses on search and retrieval of information from large datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
