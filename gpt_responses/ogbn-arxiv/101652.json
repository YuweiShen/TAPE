This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) for neural architectural search (NAS), which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of deep learning and CNNs also falls under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category.
