The paper also introduces a new recalibration process that involves computing importance values and multiplying them to the original neural response, which is a machine learning technique and falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a weighting scheme that is asymmetric in the spatial domain, which could also be relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
