The paper also discusses the performance of different modulation schemes, which is a common topic in the field of networking and communication (cs.NI, cs.COMM). The paper also proposes a resource allocation method, which is a common topic in the field of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper focuses on the specific application of cognitive M2M networks, which is a topic in the field of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
