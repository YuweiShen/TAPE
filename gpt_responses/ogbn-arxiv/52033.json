This suggests a strong focus on information theory.\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - Plausible deniability is a concept often used in the context of cryptography and security, and the paper deals with scenarios where an entity eavesdrops on a communication protocol. This suggests a strong focus on cryptography and security.\n3. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The concept of plausible deniability has implications for privacy and surveillance, which are topics often discussed in the context of computers and society. This suggests a possible focus on the societal implications of the paper's findings.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with communication protocols and broadcast channels, which are often studied in the context of social and information networks. This suggests a possible focus on the network aspects of the problem.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the transmission and reception of signals, which is a topic often studied in the context of multimedia. This suggests a possible focus on the multimedia aspects of the problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
