The paper also mentions recent advances in equilibrium computation, which falls under the subfield of computational game theory (cs.GT) and computational economics (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the query complexity of fixed-point computation, which is a topic in computational complexity theory (cs.CC).
