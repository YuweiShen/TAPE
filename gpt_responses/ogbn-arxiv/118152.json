This falls under the domain of programming languages. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses heuristics to infer array access patterns in loops and then uses this information to compositionally prove universally quantified assertions about arrays. This involves logical reasoning and falls under the domain of logic in computer science. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a tool called \\(\\textsc {Tiler}\\) that implements the proposed method. This falls under the domain of software engineering. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper uses formal methods to verify properties of programs that manipulate arrays in loops. This falls under the domain of formal languages and automata theory. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): This is less likely, but the paper does not explicitly mention any security or cryptography-related aspects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
