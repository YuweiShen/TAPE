This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of Gaussian message passing and variational expectation-maximization (EM) methods, which are commonly used in statistical inference (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with the performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm in 3D massive MIMO systems, which falls under the domain of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
