The paper uses techniques from computational geometry, linear algebra, and optimization, which are common in the subfields of computer science such as data structures (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), numerical analysis (cs.NA), and control theory (cs.SY). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
