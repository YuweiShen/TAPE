This involves evolving the utility function for the agents, which falls under the domain of AI. \n2. cs.GT (Game Theory) - The paper discusses the impact of the evolved agents on the game's design and the game design process. This relates to game theory, which studies decision-making in strategic situations. \n3. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - The paper includes a user study to compare the agents to human play traces, which falls under the domain of HCI. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The evolution of the utility function for the Monte Carlo Tree Search agents involves a form of machine learning. \n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper proposes an automated playtesting system for Match-3 games, which involves software engineering principles and practices."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
