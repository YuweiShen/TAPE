This involves clustering and visualization methods, which are often used in machine learning and data analysis (cs.AI, cs.DB, cs.LG). The paper also focuses on the practical application of the technique, which is relevant to software engineering (cs.SE) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
