This falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also proposes a machine learning approach to this problem, which involves learning from data and making predictions, which falls under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also uses a ranking machinery to score the popularity of each correspondence, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR).
