This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The use of MQTT in building larger networks with more devices connected to the internet can be seen as a distributed computing problem. \n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper discusses the implementation of an Android application, which involves software engineering principles such as design, development, and testing. \n4. cs.DB (Databases) - The paper mentions the use of geolocation data, which can be stored and managed in databases. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - Although not the main focus of the paper, the use of MQTT in IoT networks raises security concerns, which can fall under the domain of cryptography and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
