Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also mentions building shape spaces and invariance to transformations, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper's focus on processing large image databases could place it in cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
