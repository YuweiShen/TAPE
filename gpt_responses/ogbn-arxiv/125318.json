The paper also derives closed-form expressions for key performance metrics, which is a common theme in information theory. \n2. cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with FSO communication systems, which are a type of wireless communication technology. The paper also considers the use of relaying transmission, which is a common technique used in wireless networks to improve communication performance. \n3. cs.OH (Optimization and Control): The paper considers the impact of pointing errors on the performance of FSO communication systems, which can be mitigated using control techniques. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the performance analysis of FSO communication systems, which is a common topic in networking research. \n5. cs.PHYS (Physics): The paper considers the impact of turbulence-induced channel fading on the performance of FSO communication systems, which is a physical phenomenon."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
