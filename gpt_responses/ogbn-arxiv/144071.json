The focus is on minimizing the average of smooth and convex but otherwise arbitrary functions, which is a common problem in federated learning. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also involves information theory and communication complexity, which suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) as another possible category. Finally, since the paper deals with heterogeneous data, cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) could also be a relevant category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
