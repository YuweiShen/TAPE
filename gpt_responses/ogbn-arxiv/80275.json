Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the complexity of the code construction, encoding, and decoding, which falls under cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The use of polar codes for achieving vanishing error rates on binary symmetric channels relates to cs.SI (Systems and Control) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of polar codes compared to other known high-rate codes, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
