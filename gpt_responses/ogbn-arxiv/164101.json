The strategy involves relative-distance constraints, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category. The use of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas for local tasks suggests that it may belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. The approach relies on relative-state measurements without explicit information exchange, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.LG (Learning) sub-category. Finally, the approach is demonstrated with computer simulations, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
