This falls under the sub-category of Speech and Signal Processing (cs.SD) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper discusses the optimization of bitrate allocation for different channels, which could fall under the sub-categories of Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Signal Processing (cs.SP).
