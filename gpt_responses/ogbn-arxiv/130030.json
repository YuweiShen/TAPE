This involves static program analysis of both source code and binary to estimate performance attributes. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.PF (Performance): The paper is primarily concerned with performance analysis and modeling of scientific applications.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a tool for software developers to analyze and improve the performance of their applications.\n- cs.AR (Architecture): The paper discusses the generation of performance models for different architectures, including non-existent or unavailable ones.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper targets scientific applications running on supercomputers, which typically involve distributed and parallel computing.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper involves static program analysis of both source code and binary, which is related to programming language design and implementation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
