The authors also discuss the use of machine learning algorithms for face detection, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the benchmarking of face detection systems, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and computer security (cs.CR) as face detection is often used for security purposes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
