This topic falls under the broad category of Computer Science and Networking (cs.NI) and specifically addresses the sub-categories of Architecture (cs.AR) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) as it deals with the design and control of NoCs. The use of reconfigurable FPGA and NoCs also suggests the sub-categories of Embedded Systems (cs.ET) and Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
