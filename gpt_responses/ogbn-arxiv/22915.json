The proposed approach involves the use of computational puzzles inspired by Bitcoin to delay fraudulent actions and consume significant computational resources of fraudsters. The paper also introduces several novel concepts such as stateless, verifiable computational puzzles and a real-time, graph-based solution to assign fraud scores to user activities. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.CY (Computers and Society), and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
