Evolutionary algorithms are commonly used to solve ELD problems, and SSA is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that belongs to the family of evolutionary algorithms. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes a new optimization algorithm based on SSA, which is a type of artificial intelligence. The algorithm is designed to solve non-convex ELD problems, which are challenging optimization problems in power systems. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with the problem of Economic Load Dispatch (ELD), which is an important component of power system control and operation. The proposed algorithm is designed to optimize the power generation of different units in a power system while satisfying various constraints, such as valve-point effects, multi-fuel operations, prohibited operating zones, and line losses. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a new optimization algorithm based on SSA, which is a type of machine learning algorithm. The algorithm is designed to learn from the problem constraints and find the optimal solution for the ELD problem. \n5. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper uses"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
