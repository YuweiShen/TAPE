The use of low-rank modeling to solve challenges such as noise, incompleteness, and distribution difference suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The applications discussed in the paper, such as knowledge transfer and fusion, are also relevant to sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The mention of practical challenges and large-scale data analysis suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
