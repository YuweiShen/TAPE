The paper focuses on developing a theoretical framework and formulation of a probabilistic representation of the data that can be used to give approximate query answers. This work is relevant to the database community (cs.DB) as it presents a new approach to summarizing and querying large datasets. Additionally, the paper discusses solving techniques and optimizations that are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures (cs.DS), and machine learning (cs.LG). Lastly, the paper experiments with large datasets from astronomy and flights, which are relevant to scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
