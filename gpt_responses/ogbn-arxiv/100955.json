Hence, cs.IR is another likely category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a simple greedy algorithm to find the best summary, which involves machine learning techniques. Hence, cs.LG is another possible category.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper deals with NLP and machine learning techniques, which are both sub-domains of AI. Hence, cs.AI is another possible category.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses a simple and fast baseline algorithm for extractive document summarization, which involves data structures and algorithms. Hence, cs.DS is another possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
