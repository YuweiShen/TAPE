Specifically, it proposes a data augmentation technique using a neural language model (NLM) to expand the size of limited labeled data sets by leveraging massive unlabeled event data sets. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and machine learning techniques for language processing. \n\nThe paper also deals with social media data analysis and information retrieval, which are relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper employs deep learning techniques for rumor detection, which are relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SD (Software Engineering) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
