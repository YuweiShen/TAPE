The techniques involve analyzing functional Magnetic Resonance Images (fMRI) data, which is a type of image analysis (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of non-linearities, which is a common topic in neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of regularization and statistical modeling, which are common topics in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
