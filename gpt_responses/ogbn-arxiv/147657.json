The proposed method also involves the use of neural networks to selectively focus on important contexts, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also evaluates its method on benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
