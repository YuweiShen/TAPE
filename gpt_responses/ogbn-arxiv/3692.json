This involves tasks such as parsing global and local information, extracting visual elements, and reconstructing an extensible template. These tasks are related to computer graphics (cs.GR), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and information retrieval (cs.IR). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
