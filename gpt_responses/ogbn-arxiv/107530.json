The updates are sent to a monitor/receiver, which suggests a possible sub-category of networked systems (cs.NI) or control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of redundancy to improve the reliability of the transmission, which could fall under distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper deals with the effects of erasure on the transmission, which could be considered a topic in cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
