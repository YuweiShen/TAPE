The use of CNN-based models also suggests a Machine Learning (cs.MM) sub-category. The study of temporal consistency between consecutive video frames indicates a possible sub-category of Learning (cs.LG). The use of object detection models suggests an Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the study of structure options and fusion strategies may also fall under the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
