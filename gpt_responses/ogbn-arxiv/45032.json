This task is closely related to computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML), which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.CV and cs.LG sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of pairwise binary models, which are commonly used in multimedia (MM) research. The paper also involves the use of feature engineering, which is a common technique in information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP), suggesting that the paper may also belong to the cs.IR and cs.CL sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
