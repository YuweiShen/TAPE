The proposed approach involves the integration of a generator and a classifier, which is a common technique in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) research (LG). The approach also involves the use of semantic embeddings, which is a common technique in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) research (AI, CL).
