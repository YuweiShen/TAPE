The paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm using the dueling neural network architecture, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of ambient backscattering communications, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of deliberate jamming, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
