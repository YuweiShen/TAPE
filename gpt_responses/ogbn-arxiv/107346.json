The use of global cardinality constraints also suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and combinatorics (cs.CC). The study of complexity is often related to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), and the paper's focus on characterizing sets of constraints suggests a connection to logic and computation (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
