This problem is related to data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR) in the context of designing schemes for the set membership problem. Finally, the paper uses combinatorics (cs.DM) to derive lower bounds on the storage required for the schemes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
