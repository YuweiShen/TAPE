The paper describes the creation of a large and consistently annotated video data set that can be used to train and evaluate new algorithms for tasks such as object detection, tracking, and recognition. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category. \n\nThe paper also involves mapping 3D ground truth positions of multiple objects into the image, which suggests that it may also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. \n\nThe paper mentions the use of software tools and algorithms for tasks such as object detection, tracking, and recognition, which suggests that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. \n\nThe paper also involves estimating the expected systematic error on the mapped positions, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper involves the use of video data, which suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
