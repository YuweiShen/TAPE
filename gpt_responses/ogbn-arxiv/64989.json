The paper also mentions the performance and latency of ownership transfer, admission order guarantees, and lock handover operations, which are all related to Operating Systems (cs.OS). Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of the lock in C++ and the use of atomic operations, which suggests that it may also belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The paper also mentions the ability of the lock to provide progress guarantees, which is related to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of queue-based locks, which suggests that it may also belong to the Architecture (cs.AR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
