The proposed approach leverages encyclopedic background knowledge for enriching domain-specific ontologies, which involves techniques from Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). The approach aims to improve both ontology-based methods and supervised machine learning, which are topics in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Deep Learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
