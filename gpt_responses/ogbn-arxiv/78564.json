Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems and their capacity limits, which is relevant to the use of NOMA for improving throughput in random access scenarios. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of NOMA for improving the performance of multichannel ALOHA, which is a well-known random access protocol used in networking. The paper also discusses the use of NOMA for uplink transmissions, which is relevant to the study of networking and internet architecture. \n\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of coordinated and non-coordinated transmissions in NOMA, which involves the design and analysis of control systems. The paper also discusses the use of successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver, which is a control system technique used to mitigate co-channel interference. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of NOMA for improving the throughput of multichannel ALOHA, which is a protocol commonly used for multimedia applications. The paper also discusses the use of NOMA for uplink transmissions, which is relevant to the study of multimedia systems. \n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
