This is a common technique used in computer vision applications. \n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): Document image classification is a common task in information retrieval, where documents need to be classified based on their content. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel approach for document image classification using deep learning and Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs). \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for document image classification, which falls under the broader category of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper does not focus on data structures and algorithms, but the proposed approach involves training and testing large datasets, which may require efficient data structures and algorithms for processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
