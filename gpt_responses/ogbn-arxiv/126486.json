This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of integer programming and column generation for efficient search suggests a focus on optimization (cs.DM) and algorithm design (cs.SI). Finally, the emphasis on interpretability and simplicity in the learned rules may also relate to work in computational ethics (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
