The use of deeply-supervised learning is also a key aspect of the proposed method, which falls under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the architecture and design of the neural network, which could be relevant to the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the proposed method is tested on benchmark datasets, which could fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
