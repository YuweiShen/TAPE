The paper uses logic to achieve new upper bounds for the problem, which suggests that it may belong to the categories of computational complexity (cs.CC), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), logic in computer science (cs.LO), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
