Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the decoding process of polar codes, which involves statistical modeling and analysis, making cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with the performance of polar codes in large block lengths, which is relevant to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
