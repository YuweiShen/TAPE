The paper also discusses the use of motion vectors, which are commonly used in video compression (cs.MM). The strategies introduced in the paper involve transferring knowledge learned from one CNN to another, which is a topic related to transfer learning and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the speed improvement achieved by the proposed method, which is a topic related to neural networks and optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
