This is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the challenges of identifying and rejecting useless paths, which is relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper mentions the use of probabilistic analysis, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
