This falls under the scope of several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Symbolic Computation (cs.SC), Computational Complexity (cs.CC), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Computational Geometry (cs.CG), and Systems and Control (cs.SY). The paper specifically focuses on the complexity of computing the multivariate resultant, which is a fundamental tool in algebraic geometry. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SC and cs.CC, followed by cs.DS, cs.CG, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
