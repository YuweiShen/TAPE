Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves deep learning algorithms, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the use of graphs and pairwise relations could place it in cs.GR (Graphics) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
