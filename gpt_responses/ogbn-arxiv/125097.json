The paper also proposes a generative network to craft adversarial patterns, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the security implications of adversarial attacks, which could fall under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category.
