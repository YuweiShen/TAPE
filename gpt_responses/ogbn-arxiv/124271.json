This involves understanding the space of document-centered assistance, investigating the types of queries users pose while seeking assistance with documents, and building machine learned models to accurately detect and answer document-centered questions. Therefore, the most likely category is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), followed by Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) and Information Retrieval (cs.IR). Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Cybernetics (cs.CY) are also possible categories given the focus on building machine learned models and designing intelligent systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
