The paper discusses the automatic processing that supports the corpus construction, the manual annotation activities, and some features of the medical language in the abstracts selected for the annotated corpus. The paper also discusses the possible applications of this corpus. The paper's focus on text classification and natural language processing suggests that it belongs to the categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper's discussion of the medical language and the use of UMLS concepts suggests that it may also belong to the categories of cybernetics (cs.CY) and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
