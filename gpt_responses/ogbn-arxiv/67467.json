The paper proposes a novel method for incorporating spatial information into hyperspectral unmixing, which involves linear models and matrix cofactorization. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR), which often involve similar techniques. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of numerical optimization methods, which suggests that it may also be relevant to mathematical modeling (cs.MM) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
