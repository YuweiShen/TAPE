This involves the use of machine learning techniques to model and predict the missing values. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed method involves the use of AI techniques such as tensor decomposition to estimate missing traffic data. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with traffic data, which can be considered as a type of network data. The proposed method can be used to complete missing traffic data in transportation management systems. \n4. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the problem of missing traffic data, which can be seen as a problem of information loss. The proposed method aims to recover the missing information using tensor decomposition. \n5. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes a numerical method based on tensor decomposition to estimate missing traffic data. This involves the use of numerical algorithms to solve the optimization problem involved in tensor decomposition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
