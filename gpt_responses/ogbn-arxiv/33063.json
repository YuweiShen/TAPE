The paper also discusses the use of noisy data and the trade-offs between private and public objectives, which are relevant to the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data science (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of fairness-constrained profit-maximizing policies, which is relevant to the field of computational economics (cs.CE). Finally, the paper discusses the applicability of the approach to a wide range of practical decisions, which is relevant to the field of social informatics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
