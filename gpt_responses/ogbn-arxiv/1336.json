The paper proposes a new algorithm for feature evaluation called Contrastive Feature Induction (CFI), which is designed to be efficient for high-dimensional problems like statistical relational learning. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Cryptography and Security (cs.CR), and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
