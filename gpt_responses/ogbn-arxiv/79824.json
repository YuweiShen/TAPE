Therefore, it is most likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the use of deep neural networks suggests that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of photo summarization systems, which suggests that it may belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a method for visualizing defect severity heat maps, which suggests that it may also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
