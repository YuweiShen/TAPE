Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also proposes a mathematical analysis to assess interference among stations, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper deals with millimeter wave frequencies, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper proposes a Markov Chain model, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper proposes a transmission scheduler, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.PF (Performance)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
