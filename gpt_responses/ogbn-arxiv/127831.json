The paper also mentions applications in super-resolution (cs.MM) and single-photon imaging (cs.SI), which are sub-fields of computer vision. Additionally, the paper discusses the efficiency of the algorithms, which is a topic of interest in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
