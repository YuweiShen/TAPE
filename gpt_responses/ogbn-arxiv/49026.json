The paper presents a top-down approach to the problem of formalizing contract statements in a machine-readable way. This involves identifying the most relevant contract statements and modeling their underlying rules in a novel knowledge engineering method. The paper also describes the development of a user-friendly tool for this purpose. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the paper deals with developing conversational agents, cs.CL (Computation and Language) as the paper deals with natural language processing, cs.LG (Machine Learning) as the paper describes a novel knowledge engineering method, cs.SE (Software Engineering) as the paper describes the development of a user-friendly tool, and cs.CY (Computers and Society) as the paper deals with the societal impact of chatbots handling contractual conditions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
