The paper also defines a translation from programs with indirect jump instructions to programs without them, which is a common technique in programming language semantics. \n\n2. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the behaviour of programs with indirect jump instructions, which is a concern in software engineering. The paper also considers the translation of programs with indirect jump instructions to programs without them, which is a technique used in software engineering to improve program correctness and maintainability. \n\n3. cs.AR (Architecture): The paper deals with the behaviour of programs on interaction with a memory device, which is a concern in computer architecture. The paper also considers different kinds of indirect jump instructions, which are relevant to the design of instruction sets and microarchitectures. \n\n4. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper defines the meaning of programs with indirect jump instructions by means of a translation into programs without them, which is a topic in logic and semantics. The paper also considers the intended behaviour of programs with indirect jump instructions, which is a topic in modal logic and verification. \n\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not directly deal with cryptography or security, but the behaviour of programs with indirect jump instructions can be relevant to security vulnerabilities such as buffer over"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
