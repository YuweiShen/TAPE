This involves facial landmarking using supervised machine learning, symmetry plane detection, template warping, and pose normalization. These techniques are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV), graphics (cs.GR), multimedia (cs.MM), human-computer interaction (cs.HC), and machine learning (cs.LG) research. Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
