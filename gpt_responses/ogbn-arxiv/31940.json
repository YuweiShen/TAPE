Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the analysis of the impact of spatial correlation on the performance limits, which is related to systems and control theory, leading to the possibility of cs.SY (Systems and Control) being a likely sub-category. The use of finite signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values and the derivation of a lower bound on the outage probability suggest the possibility of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) being a relevant sub-category. Finally, the use of asymptotic analysis suggests the possibility of cs.MA (Machine Learning) being a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
