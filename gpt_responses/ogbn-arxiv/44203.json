It also involves the use of deep neural networks (DNNs), which are commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) research, making cs.CL and cs.LG likely sub-categories as well. The paper also involves unsupervised learning, which falls under the sub-category of Statistical Learning (cs.SI). Finally, the use of a gating DNN to determine which expert is assigned to a given speech segment suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
