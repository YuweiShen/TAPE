This problem has applications in various areas such as network security, copyright protection, and data authentication. The paper presents models and algorithmic foundations for graph watermarking, including security definitions and proofs, as well as characterizations of when graph watermarking is algorithmically feasible. The paper also demonstrates the strength of the approach with exemplary watermarking schemes for two random graph models, the classic Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi model and a random power-law graph model, both of which are used to model real-world networks. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
