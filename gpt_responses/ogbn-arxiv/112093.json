The proposed solution involves the use of knowledge graphs, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of machine learning techniques such as Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Learning to Rank (LTR) also suggests the paper may belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
