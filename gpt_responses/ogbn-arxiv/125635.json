The paper also proposes a learning framework that jointly optimizes object labels, bounding box coordinates, and model parameters, which involves machine learning techniques, so it could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) categories. Additionally, the paper mentions experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets, which are commonly used in multimedia and computer vision research, so it could also belong to the cs.MM (Multimedia) category. Finally, the paper addresses the problem of noisy annotations, which could be relevant to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) category, as noisy data can be seen as a form of adversarial attack."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
