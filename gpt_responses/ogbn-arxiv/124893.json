Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. The paper also uses neural networks for SRL, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely category. Additionally, the paper proposes a new dataset for SRL in Indonesian conversational domain, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper also discusses the efficiency of active learning, which could be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
