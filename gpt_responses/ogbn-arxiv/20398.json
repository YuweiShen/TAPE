The paper discusses the tension between doing well globally on all users and doing well on any specific individual user. This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories, including cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.CY (Computers and Society), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). However, given the focus on personalization and the use of a new metric, cs.LG and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
