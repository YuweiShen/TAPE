The use of sampling-based algorithms and probabilistic completeness suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The analysis of computational complexity and the use of random geometric graphs suggest a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the use of novel connections between sampling-based motion planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs suggests a connection to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
