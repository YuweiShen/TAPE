The paper also discusses the cost of flows required to support multicast, which is a topic related to network infrastructure (cs.NI) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The use of mirror sites and distributed storage solutions also falls under the category of distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents algorithms for determining the content of the source nodes, which is a topic related to information retrieval and search (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
