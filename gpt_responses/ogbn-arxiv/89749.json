The paper also mentions the \"91 function,\" which is a classic example of recursion in computer science and is often used to teach recursion in introductory courses (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses Takeuchi's triple recursion, which is a well-known example of recursion in programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also mentions machine verification, which is a topic in formal methods and programming languages (cs.FL). Finally, the paper raises open questions, which could potentially be addressed using computational complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
