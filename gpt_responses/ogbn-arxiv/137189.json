It proposes a \"Separation of Concerns\" approach for the development of parallel and optimised MD codes, which involves writing code at a high abstraction level in a domain specific language (DSL) that is then translated into efficient computer code. This paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): This sub-category covers papers that focus on the development and application of computational methods in engineering, finance, and science. The proposed approach for developing parallel and optimised MD codes is relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): This sub-category covers papers that focus on the development and application of mathematical software. The proposed approach for developing a Python code generation system for molecular dynamics simulations is relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): This sub-category covers papers that focus on the design, analysis, and implementation of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing systems. The proposed approach for developing parallel and optimised MD codes is relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): This sub-category covers papers that focus on the design, development, and maintenance of software systems.
