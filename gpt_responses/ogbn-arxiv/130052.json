Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses regularization techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning, and specifically in neural networks. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of neural networks, which falls under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and the use of IWSLT datasets, which are commonly used in speech and language processing, falling under cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
