The use of low complexity polynomial methods suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.SI) and communication systems (cs.COMM). Finally, the use of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques may also suggest a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
