The paper also mentions the use of iterative decoding, which is a common technique in network information theory (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of protographs in code construction, which is a topic that falls under the sub-field of distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
