This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of AMP in image/video-processing applications, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of Markov random field prior distribution, which falls under statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
