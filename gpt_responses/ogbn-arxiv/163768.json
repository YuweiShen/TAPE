The use of demand oracles to elicit preferences of agents is a common technique in mechanism design and social choice theory, which are also subfields of algorithmic game theory. The paper also involves the study of submodular and subadditive valuations, which are topics in discrete mathematics and combinatorial optimization (cs.DS). The development of algorithms with improved approximation ratios involves techniques from approximation algorithms and machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with the design of procurement auctions, which is a topic in electronic commerce (cs.EC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
