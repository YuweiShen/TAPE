The pairwise balanced design (PBD) is a combinatorial object that is used in the paper to derive results about the sizes of optimal constant-composition codes, which suggests that the paper could also belong to the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) category. Additionally, the paper involves the study of the sizes of codes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also deals with the problem of determining the size of optimal constant-composition codes, which could be considered a cryptographic problem (cs.CR). Finally, the paper involves the application of mathematical techniques to solve a problem, which could be considered a topic in cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
