The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning techniques suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of supervised learning and empirical study further supports this. The paper also deals with the problem of multi-label classification, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The application of the proposed approach to large-scale urban reconstruction suggests that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
