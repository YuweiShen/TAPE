Therefore, cs.IR is another likely sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions the use of supervised and unsupervised models for the task of semantic similarity evaluation, which falls under the domain of machine learning. Hence, cs.LG is a possible sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with NLP and machine learning techniques for semantic similarity evaluation, which are sub-fields of artificial intelligence. Therefore, cs.AI is another possible sub-category.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper mentions the use of neural network-based models for the task of semantic similarity evaluation, which falls under the domain of neural computing.
