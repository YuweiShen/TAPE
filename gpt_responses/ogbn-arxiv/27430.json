The use of competitive minimax approach and Gallager's techniques for the analysis of error exponents suggests that the paper may also belong to the categories of coding theory (cs.CC) and statistical learning (cs.LG). The study of error exponents for discrete memoryless channels (DMC's) and time-varying convolutional codes suggests that the paper may also belong to the categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
