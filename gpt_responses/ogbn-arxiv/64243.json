MCTS is a popular choice in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for solving such problems. The paper proposes a preference-based MCTS variant that only depends on qualitative feedback, which opens up new applications for MCTS. The paper also discusses the underlying structure of feedback signals in different domains, which suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of AI, ML, game theory (GT), control systems (SY), and data structures (DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
