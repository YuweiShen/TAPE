This topic is closely related to the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and neural networks, which are all covered by the arXiv CS sub-categories of cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, and cs.NE. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of sequential tests and early stopping inequalities, which are topics that fall under the sub-category of cs.SD (Systems and Control). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.NE, and cs.SD, ordered from most to least likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
