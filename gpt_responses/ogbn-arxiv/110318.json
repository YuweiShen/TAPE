This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel dual loss function, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of deep learning for medical image analysis also falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
