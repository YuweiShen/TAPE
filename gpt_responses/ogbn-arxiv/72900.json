The paper specifically focuses on the finite-resolution regime and characterizes the error probability of algorithms as a function of properties of the transformation and the image capture noise. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. \n\nThe paper also uses statistical techniques such as Berry-Esseen type CLTs and type-counting results to analyze the performance of the algorithms, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the finite-sample performance of universal image registration, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
