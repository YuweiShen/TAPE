The paper also introduces a novel approach to balancing the trade-off between early and late fusion, which is a problem that is often encountered in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper uses multi-objective regularization to optimize the central network and the unimodal networks, which is a technique that is commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
