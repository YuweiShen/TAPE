The paper also discusses convergence rates for generalized Bayesian inference, which is a subfield of machine learning. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper introduces a new witness condition that connects the excess risk to an 'annealed' version thereof, which generalizes several previous results connecting Hellinger and R\\'enyi divergence to KL divergence. This is a topic that falls under information theory. \n- cs.ST (Statistics): The paper discusses optimization of excess risk bounds for general estimators, which is a topic in statistics. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses convergence rates for generalized Bayesian inference, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents new excess risk bounds for general unbounded loss functions, which is a topic that can be related to data structures and algorithms used in machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
