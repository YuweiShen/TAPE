The paper proposes new succinct representations of ordinal trees and discusses their static and dynamic properties. This makes it likely to belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The paper also discusses range queries, which is a topic in computational geometry, making it likely to belong to the cs.CG (Computational Geometry) sub-category. The paper also discusses entropy-bounded storage of dynamic sequences, which is a topic in information theory, making it likely to belong to the cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-category. The paper also discusses compressed full-text self-indexes, which is a topic in data compression, making it likely to belong to the cs.DM (Data Compression) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses time complexity of operations, which is a topic in theoretical computer science, making it likely to belong to the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
