This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) domain. The proposed approach involves semi-supervised learning, which involves training a model on both labeled and unlabeled data. This falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) domain. The approach also involves generating low resolution images, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) domain. The paper also discusses the impact of landmark detection on face recognition, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) domain. Finally, the paper involves experimentation and evaluation of the proposed approach, which falls under the information retrieval (cs.IR) domain."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
