It also involves modeling social interactions and markets, which are topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The analysis of many-to-many and one-to-one matchings falls under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses computational hardness results and polynomial-time algorithms, which are topics in theoretical computer science (cs.THE).
