The paper proposes a novel approach called Self-Tuning Networks (STNs) that adapt regularization hyperparameters for neural networks by fitting compact approximations to the best-response function. This involves modeling the best-response as a single network whose hidden units are gated conditionally on the regularizer. The paper also discusses the justification for this approximation and the gradient-based hyperparameter optimization algorithm used. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
