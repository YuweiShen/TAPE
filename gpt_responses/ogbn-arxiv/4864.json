This is a common problem in machine learning and falls under the category of \"large scale optimization\" (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the recovery problem, which involves accurately recovering the optimal solution to the original problem in the high-dimensional space based on the solution learned from the low-dimensional subspace. This is related to the field of \"compressed sensing\" (cs.IT) and \"numerical analysis\" (cs.NA). The paper also involves analyzing the performance of the proposed algorithm, which falls under the category of \"experimental design and analysis\" (cs.DS) and \"machine learning\" (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
