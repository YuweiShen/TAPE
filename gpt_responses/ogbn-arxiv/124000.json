The paper also uses mathematical and computational methods to formalize the notion of a lexicon and dictionary of meanings, which suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of monoidal categories also suggests a focus on mathematical foundations (cs.DS) and possibly information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
