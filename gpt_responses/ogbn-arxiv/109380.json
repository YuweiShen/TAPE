Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the design parameters applicable to the first three layers of the OSI model, i.e., physical, data link, and network layer, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Additionally, the paper discusses proposed solutions for some of the challenges faced by small satellite systems, which could also place it in cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
