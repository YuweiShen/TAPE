This involves the study of channel capacity, coding schemes, and error correction techniques, which are all topics covered in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the use of physical layer network coding in a two-way relaying scenario, which is a networking problem. The paper also addresses the issue of reducing overhead bits in the broadcast phase, which is a common concern in networking. \n3. cs.SI (Signal Processing) - The paper deals with the design of modulation schemes for QAM signal sets, which is a topic covered in signal processing. The paper also discusses the issue of singular fade states, which is a signal processing problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the use of QAM signal sets, which are commonly used in multimedia applications such as digital TV and video streaming. The paper also addresses the issue of reducing complexity at the relay, which is important in multimedia applications where real-time processing is required. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - Although the paper does not directly deal with cryptography or security, the use of network coding in a two-way relaying scenario has potential applications in secure communication.
