The proposed algorithm also involves knowledge distillation, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves quantitative analysis of computational cost and storage overhead, which can be related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
