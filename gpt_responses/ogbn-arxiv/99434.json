The concept of adaptive submodularity introduced in the paper is a generalization of submodular set functions, which are widely used in machine learning and optimization. The paper also gives examples of adaptive submodular objectives arising in diverse applications including sensor placement, viral marketing, and active learning, which are all subfields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
