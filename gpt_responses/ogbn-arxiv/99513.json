The use of secrecy codes and rate-limited secret-key generation also suggests a focus on cryptography (cs.CR). The consideration of a generalized multiple access channel and the characterization of the strong secret-key capacity region may fall under the categories of communication and networking (cs.CY, cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
