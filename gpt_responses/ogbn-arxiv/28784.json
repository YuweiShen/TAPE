The experiments involve training convolutional networks, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) tasks. The paper also discusses the difficulties in training learned optimizers, which can be related to optimization (cs.NE) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
