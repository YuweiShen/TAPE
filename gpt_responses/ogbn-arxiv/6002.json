Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which deals with the retrieval of information from large collections of data, including text. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of MAUI toolkit, which is a supervised learning approach for AKE. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and machine learning. \n\nThe experiments were conducted within a Multimedia Monitoring Solution (MMS) system for TV and radio news/programs, which suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia). \n\nThe paper also discusses the impact of filtering on AKE accuracy, which could be of interest to researchers in cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) who are working on improving the accuracy of NLP models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
