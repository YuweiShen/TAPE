The use of phased array and beamforming techniques also suggests a focus on networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of eavesdropping and information leakage, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The proposed algorithm for optimizing the beampattern also involves system optimization and control (cs.SY). Finally, the use of millimeter-wave technology for wireless communications suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
