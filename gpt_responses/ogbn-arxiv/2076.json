The use of vector embeddings and machine learning techniques to detect and remove occlusions also suggests a strong presence of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories.

Finally, the use of datasets and user studies suggests a multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
