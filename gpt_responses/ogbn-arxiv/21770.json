The paper proposes a novel neural network architecture for this task, which involves learning domain-specific embeddings and using them to generalize learning across related domains. This work is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
