The proposed approach involves extracting sentiments and emotional content from news documents, which is a common task in sentiment analysis research. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper also involves reducing the bulky news data to extract the hottest topics and news titles as knowledge. This task is related to information retrieval, which is a subfield of computer science that deals with the retrieval of information from large collections of data. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an approach to generate a word model using Word2Vec to understand the relations between words in the collected news database. This task involves training a machine learning model to learn the semantic relationships between words, which falls under the domain of machine learning. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper analyzes news articles from six different countries and five different news categories. This task involves analyzing social and information networks to understand the sentiment and emotional content of news articles across different regions and topics. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper also has implications for understanding the impact of news articles on society. By analyzing the sentiment and emotional content of news articles, the proposed approach can provide insights into the public perception of various events and topics."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
