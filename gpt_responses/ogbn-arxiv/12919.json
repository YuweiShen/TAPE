The paper also emphasizes the importance of building trust in robot systems, which is related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The proposed approach involves using machine learning techniques for state summarization and querying, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the need for a user-friendly human interface, which is a key aspect of systems engineering (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
