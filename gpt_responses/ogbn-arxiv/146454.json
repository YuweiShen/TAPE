The proposed method involves learning to predict critical states from local environment features, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of computer vision for environment perception (cs.CV) and the hierarchical graph structure for efficient planning (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
