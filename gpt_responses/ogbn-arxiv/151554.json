The paper proposes a new test to study this capability and analyzes four different recurrent network models. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the role of feature selection and memorization in sequence learning, which relates to natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
