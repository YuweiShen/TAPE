The focus on secure transmission and interference management suggests the category of security and privacy (cs.CR) as well. The use of multiple antennas and layered transmission makes the paper relevant to the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MM). Finally, the consideration of quality-of-service requirements and channel state information imperfections suggests the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
