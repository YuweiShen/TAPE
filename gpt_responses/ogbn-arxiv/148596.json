The use of degree information to bound the output size of a query and obtain faster join algorithms involves graph theory and algorithms (cs.DS, cs.DC). The paper also discusses the use of MapReduce for parallel processing (cs.CC) and the optimization of communication complexity (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
