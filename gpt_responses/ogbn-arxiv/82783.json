The paper also discusses differential privacy, which falls under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and is a common technique for preserving privacy in machine learning. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of large-scale training datasets, which is a common topic in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper mentions computer vision tasks, which falls under cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
