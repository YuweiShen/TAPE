It involves using text similarity between a user's own tweets and recent tweets by people they follow. This paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This sub-category deals with the study of social networks and their properties, as well as the analysis of information diffusion and social influence. This paper clearly falls under this category as it deals with modeling social interaction online and detecting non-explicit responses. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with natural language processing, text mining, and computational linguistics. The proposed approach in this paper involves using text similarity, which is a common technique in this field. \n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): This sub-category deals with the design, development, and maintenance of software systems. While this paper does not explicitly deal with software engineering, it does propose a new approach to detect social interactions, which could be implemented in software systems. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): This sub-category deals with the social and ethical implications of computing and technology. This paper could be relevant to this sub-category as it discusses the importance of detecting non-explicit responses in order to mitigate biases and build more accurate models when studying social interaction and information diffusion. \n-"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
