It may also belong to Information Retrieval (cs.IR) because it discusses how the corpus can be queried and exploited. Additionally, it could be classified under Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Deep Learning (cs.DL) because these techniques are often used in natural language processing tasks such as corpus analysis. Finally, it could be classified under Cybernetics (cs.CY) because the development of terminological knowledge bases is a common application of cybernetics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
