The use of MILP methods for trajectory generation also falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of obstacle avoidance, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of optimization techniques, which are often used in machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
