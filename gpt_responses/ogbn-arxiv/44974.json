This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a weak supervision based active learning approach, which involves iteratively querying labels for informative images, indicating a potential fit for the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of deep learning-based object detection, which falls under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of publicly available datasets, suggesting a potential fit for the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
