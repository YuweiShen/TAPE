This work is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) as well as natural language processing (cs.CL) due to its application in image captioning. Additionally, the use of recurrent structures suggests relevance to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
