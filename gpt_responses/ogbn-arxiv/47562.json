Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions that the method uses text transcripts to label the training images, which suggests that natural language processing (NLP) techniques may be involved, making cs.CL a likely sub-category as well. The paper also mentions constructing datasets and evaluating the proposed method, which suggests that information retrieval (IR) techniques may be involved, making cs.IR a likely sub-category. The paper proposes a pure end-to-end learning method, which involves designing a neural network architecture, making machine learning (LG) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a novel method for recognizing multiple text sequences, which involves solving a challenging problem, making artificial intelligence (AI) a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
