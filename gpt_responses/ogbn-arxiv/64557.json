This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method is applied to several applications including open-universe Gaussian mixture models (cs.CV), and a real-world named entity recognition task (cs.CL). Additionally, the use of neural networks for fast approximations to block Gibbs conditionals may also fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
