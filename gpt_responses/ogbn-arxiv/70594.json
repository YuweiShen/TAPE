This category is highly likely to contain papers related to this problem.\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a kernelization algorithm and a time complexity analysis for the Block Graph Deletion problem. This category is also likely to contain papers related to this problem.\n3. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper involves the study of graphs and their properties, which is a subfield of computational geometry. This category may contain papers related to this problem.\n4. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The Block Graph Deletion problem can be seen as a game between two players, where one player tries to delete vertices to make the graph a block graph, and the other player tries to prevent this. This category may contain papers related to this problem.\n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper involves the study of the time complexity of the Block Graph Deletion problem.
