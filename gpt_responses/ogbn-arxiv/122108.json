The paper also discusses the use of parallel computing, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Additionally, the paper may be relevant to the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) due to its focus on optimization methods for machine learning. The use of stochastic methods and convergence analysis may also make this paper relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the implementation of the proposed algorithms on Parameter Server may make this paper relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
