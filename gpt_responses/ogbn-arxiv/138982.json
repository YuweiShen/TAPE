This involves the use of multi-cellular precoding and decoding techniques, which are relevant to the fields of information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), signal processing (cs.SI), multimedia (cs.MM), and communication (cs.COM). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
