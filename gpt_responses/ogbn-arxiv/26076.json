This topic falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions noise management and incremental learning, which are common challenges in neural networks (cs.NE) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the use of probabilities and their normalization and revision, which are techniques commonly used in data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
