The paper also discusses the training of the network using a single learning objective, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel structure for the network, which involves partitioning the categories into disjoint subsets, and this could be considered an aspect of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are a type of neural network (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on datasets such as CIFAR100 and ImageNet, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
