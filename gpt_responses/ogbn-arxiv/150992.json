This involves the use of self-adaptation and variable topologies to allow the number of neurons, connection weights, and interneural connectivity pattern to emerge. The networks are evaluated on simulated robotic navigation tasks, which suggests that the paper could belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category covers papers that focus on the development of neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. The paper's use of a spiking neuroevolutionary system and the evaluation of networks on simulated robotic navigation tasks make it a likely fit for this sub-category. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): This sub-category covers papers that focus on new and emerging technologies, including memristors. The paper's use of memristors as plastic connections suggests that it could belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): This sub-category covers papers that focus on robotics and autonomous systems. The paper's evaluation of networks on simulated robotic navigation tasks makes it a likely fit for this sub-category. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category covers papers that focus on the design and analysis of control systems.
