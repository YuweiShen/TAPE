The use of interconnected p-bits for optimization and inference suggests a possible connection to Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the implementation of Boolean functions in an inverted mode, which could be related to Architecture (cs.AR) and Digital Circuits (cs.DC). Finally, the use of microcontrollers to emulate p-bits suggests a possible connection to Embedded Systems (cs.ETL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
