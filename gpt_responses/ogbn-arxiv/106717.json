The metric is also fit to a new database based on human raters, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the paper discusses the metric's response to objects potentially carrying semantic relevance, which relates to natural language processing (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper uses visualization techniques, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
