The use of distributed antenna systems and the joint allocation of subcarriers, antennas, and power also suggest a Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of multiple antennas for multi-user MIMO (cs.MM) and the consideration of complexity in the design of the techniques, which could fall under Computer Engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
