This involves the use of attention-based LSTM modules to encode input signals and model how various chromatin marks cooperate automatically. The paper also evaluates the model across 56 different cell types in human. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper also deals with biological concepts related to gene regulation, which makes it relevant to q-bio.GN (Genomics) and q-bio.TO (Other Quantitative Biology)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
