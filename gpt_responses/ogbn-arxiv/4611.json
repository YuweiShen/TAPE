The proposed method involves optimizing a reward function, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data mining (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the use of a data structure called the triplet relationship, which is a novel contribution and could be of interest to researchers in the field of similarity search (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
