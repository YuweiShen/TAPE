Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper proposes a novel theoretical framework to measure data overlap and a re-weighting scheme to re-balance the loss, which are both related to machine learning and optimization. Therefore, the paper could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper conducts experiments on large-scale datasets, which involves natural language processing and computer vision tasks, and therefore, it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
