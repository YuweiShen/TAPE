The proposed algorithm is a modification of the Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm, which is a popular method in machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SP). The paper also discusses the computational efficiency of the algorithm, which suggests a numerical analysis (cs.NA) perspective. Finally, the paper proposes a new approach to stabilizing AMP, which can be considered a contribution to the field of optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
