Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of NMT systems, which could be categorized under \"cs.NE\" (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper also mentions the use of word embeddings in image captioning, which could be related to \"cs.CV\" (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
