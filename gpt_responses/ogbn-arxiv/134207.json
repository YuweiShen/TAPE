The paper outlines three basic models of deep learning, including multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks, and further analyzes emerging new models of convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The paper also summarizes deep learning's applications in many areas of artificial intelligence, including voice, computer vision, natural language processing, etc. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
