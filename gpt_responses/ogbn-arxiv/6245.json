Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new training method, which involves adaptive focusing on hard data and synthesizing complementary samples, indicating that machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) are also relevant sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses a large-scale fashion dataset, suggesting that multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) may also be relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
