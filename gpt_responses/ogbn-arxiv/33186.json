It also emphasizes message passing as the primary means of communication between actors. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses how ActorScript can dynamically adapt to resources available and current load, allowing execution to be dynamically adjusted for system load and capacity. It also mentions that ActorScript can minimize latency along critical paths. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper highlights the safety and security features of ActorScript, such as extension invariance and the prevention of applications from directly harming each other. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper briefly mentions that binary XML and JSON are data types in ActorScript. \n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper mentions that ActorScript can specify the interface between hardware and software. However, this is a less likely category compared to the others."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
