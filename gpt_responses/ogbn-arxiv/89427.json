The paper also mentions applications in data science (cs.DS), and discusses efficient algorithms with practical storage and computation requirements (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper covers algorithm-independent converse bounds (cs.SI) and sublinear-time algorithms (cs.CC), which are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
