Specifically, the paper studies the geometric properties of such objectives and devises optimization algorithms with provable guarantees. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of efficient algorithms and data structures for solving computational problems. The paper's focus on optimization algorithms with provable guarantees makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the theory and applications of machine learning, including optimization problems that arise in this context. The paper's focus on DR-submodular functions, which are commonly used in machine learning, makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the theory and applications of artificial intelligence, including optimization problems that arise in this context. The paper's focus on non-convex optimization and probabilistic models suggests that it could be relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category deals with the mathematical foundations of information processing, including optimization problems that arise in this context.
