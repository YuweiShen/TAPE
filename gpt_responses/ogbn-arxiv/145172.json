Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of positional scoring rules, which are commonly used in machine learning and data science, making cs.LG and cs.DS likely sub-categories as well. The paper also deals with voting and preference aggregation, which falls under the sub-category of cs.GT (game theory).
