It focuses on the need for tools that support end-users in gaining awareness of data disclosures by their devices, forming educated privacy preferences, and blocking unwanted data flows. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CY (Computers and Society), which deals with the social and ethical aspects of computing. \n\nThe paper also involves user studies and explores the potential for new tools to empower end-users with both knowledge and mechanisms to control disclosures from their homes. Hence, it could also belong to cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), which deals with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use. \n\nThe paper also discusses the privacy threat posed by connected devices in the home and the need for effective privacy protection mechanisms. Therefore, it could belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), which deals with the design and analysis of cryptographic algorithms and security protocols. \n\nThe paper also involves the development of a novel technology probe with unique affordances and limitations, which could belong to cs.SI (Systems and Control) or cs.SD (Software Engineering), which deal with the design, development, and evaluation of complex systems and software."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
