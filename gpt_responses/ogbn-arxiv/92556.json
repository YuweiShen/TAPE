The use of Lipschitz functions and the focus on regret minimization suggest that the paper is likely to be classified under machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The mention of combinatorial algorithm selection problems and the empirical evaluation on online clustering benchmarks suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the areas of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the mention of \"expert selection\" suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the area of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
