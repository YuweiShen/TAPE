The focus on image processing and noise reduction suggests that cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The mention of mathematical analysis and efficient implementation suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.MM (Multimedia) as possible sub-categories. The mention of hardware realization suggests cs.SI (Systems and Control) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the mention of boundaries and spikes suggests cs.GR (Graphics) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
