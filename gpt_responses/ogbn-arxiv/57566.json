The paper also uses the Chernoff-Hoeffding bound, which is a common tool in computational complexity theory (cs.CC). The paper also involves analyzing the probability of drawing an unsuitable codebook, which can be seen as a problem in probability theory and statistics (cs.DS). The paper also deals with the converse part of the problem, which involves showing that a certain result carries over to the continuous case, which can be seen as a problem in control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves proving the existence of good resolvability codebooks, which can be seen as a problem in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
