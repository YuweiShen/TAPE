It also involves coding theory, specifically polynomial codes, which falls under information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses secure and private computation, which are topics in cryptography (cs.CR). The use of submatrix products and partitioning suggests that the paper may also be related to data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a new method for improving the state of the art, which could be considered a machine learning or optimization problem (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
