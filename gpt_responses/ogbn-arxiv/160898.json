The paper also discusses the use of backscatter tags, which are a type of wireless communication technology used in IoT and wireless sensor networks, making it relevant to cs.NI. \n\nThe paper also involves the design of a novel waveform for backscatter transmission, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.IT (Information Theory). The waveform is designed to exploit the maximum Degree-of-Freedoms (DoFs) of the backscatter channel, which could also be relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it involves the design of a system for vehicular positioning. \n\nThe paper's focus on developing a new backscatter transmission to estimate the relative position of the vehicle and the tag could also make it relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) as machine learning techniques are often used in positioning systems. Finally, the paper's extensive simulations to verify the accuracy of the proposed system could also make it relevant to cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
