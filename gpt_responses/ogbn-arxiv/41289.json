The paper focuses on the analysis of the achievable rates of transmissions and the energy recycled by the FD radios in a four-node scenario. The paper's content is related to information theory (cs.IT) as it deals with the analysis of achievable rates of transmissions. The paper also deals with network infrastructure (cs.NI) as it discusses the design of radios for next-generation networks. The paper's content is related to systems and control (cs.SY) as it involves the design of a new three-port element for the radio. The paper's content is related to multimedia (cs.MM) as it discusses the use of power dividers and energy harvesters for improving the spectral efficiency of the radio. Finally, the paper's content is related to computer communications (cs.COM) as it discusses the design of radios for communication networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
