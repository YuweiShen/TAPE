The use of geometric frameworks and linear subspaces suggests a connection to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and scientific computing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses fundamental properties of linear subspaces, which could fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
