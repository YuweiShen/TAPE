This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the performance of Raptor codes, which is a fundamental problem in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - Raptor codes are widely used in multimedia broadcast/multicast applications, which are important in networking and internet architecture. The performance analysis of Raptor codes under ML decoding is relevant to the design and optimization of such systems. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - Raptor codes involve the use of coding algorithms and data structures to encode and decode data. The analysis of the performance of Raptor codes under ML decoding may involve the development of new algorithms and data structures. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - Raptor codes can be used in the context of social and information networks, such as peer-to-peer networks and content distribution networks. The performance analysis of Raptor codes under ML decoding is relevant to the study of such networks. \n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The analysis of the performance of Raptor codes under ML decoding may involve the study of the computational complexity of decoding algorithms. This is relevant to the field of computational complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
