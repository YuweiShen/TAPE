The prototypes also use various physical systems such as fluidic, growth of slime mould, Marangoni flow, crawling of epithelial cells, excitation waves in chemical medium, propagating crystallisation patterns, which fall under the categories of control engineering (CE), systems and control (SY), and neural networks (NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
