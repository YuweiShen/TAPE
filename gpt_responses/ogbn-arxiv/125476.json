This involves disentangling appearance, canonical, and pose features, which are then utilized as classification features. The paper also introduces a new dataset, Frontal-View Gait (FVG), which focuses on gait recognition from frontal-view walking. Given these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) are also possible sub-categories given the focus on gait recognition and the collection of a new dataset."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
