This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper involves the recognition of Pashto letters, which is a language-specific task. Hence, it can be categorized under this sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Neural Network (NN) classifiers for letter recognition, which are machine learning algorithms.\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves the retrieval of information from handwritten Pashto letters, which can be categorized under this sub-category.\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves the use of machine learning algorithms for letter recognition, which is a sub-domain of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
