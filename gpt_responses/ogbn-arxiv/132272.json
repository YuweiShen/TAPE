The use of subgaussian prior is a common technique in both fields. The paper also involves a theoretical analysis of the sample complexity, which is a common topic in theoretical computer science (cs.DS) and statistics (cs.SI). Finally, the proposed estimator has a computational complexity, which is a common topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
