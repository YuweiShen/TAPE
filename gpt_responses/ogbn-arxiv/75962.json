The paper also proposes a novel label inference algorithm, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents experiments on real datasets, which suggests that it could also be classified under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
