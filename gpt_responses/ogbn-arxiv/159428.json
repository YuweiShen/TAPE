The problem involves approximating a non-Gaussian subspace given samples of a random variable in n-dimensional Euclidean space. The paper proposes an algorithm based on relative entropy as the contrast function and fits under the projection pursuit framework. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.IT (Information Theory)\n- cs.ST (Statistics)\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
