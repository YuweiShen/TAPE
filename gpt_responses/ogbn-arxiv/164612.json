The paper also considers wind uncertainty and corrective control policies for HVDC converters and generators. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the control of interconnected ac and HVDC grids, which falls under the scope of systems and control. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a scalable approach using Benders decomposition, which is a technique commonly used in distributed optimization. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves the use of chance constraints, which are commonly used in decision-making under uncertainty and optimization problems in AI. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper deals with HVDC systems, which are an emerging technology in the field of power systems. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): Although the paper does not explicitly mention the use of neural or evolutionary computing, these techniques are commonly used in power system optimization and control, which is the main focus of the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
