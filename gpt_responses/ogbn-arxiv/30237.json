The technique is designed to reduce computational overhead and improve efficiency, which is also relevant to neural network optimization and training (cs.NE). The experiments conducted in the paper involve several tasks related to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL), indicating that the proposed technique can be applied to various domains. Additionally, the paper discusses the properties of the proposed technique, such as re-scaling invariance and learning rate adaptation, which are fundamental concepts in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
