It leverages transfer learning from a larger, more highly represented dialogue source to achieve state-of-the-art dialogue generation performance in a few-shot setup without using any annotated data. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, since the paper proposes a novel technique for efficient learning, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, since the paper evaluates its model on a dataset consisting of human-human goal-oriented dialogues, cs.SD (Sound) is a less likely but still possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
