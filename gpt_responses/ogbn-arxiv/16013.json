This involves formal characterization of bigraphs and rewriting rules for biologically meaningful interactions. The paper also discusses the use of this framework for comparing and merging models at different abstraction levels. Given this focus on modeling and formalization, the most likely sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control). However, the paper also touches on topics related to databases (cs.DB), logic (cs.LO), and programming languages (cs.PL), as well as computational biology (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
