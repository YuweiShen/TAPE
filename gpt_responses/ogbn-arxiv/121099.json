The paper also discusses the use of power-law-like distributions, which are commonly used in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Complex Systems (cs.CC) research. The configuration model used in the paper is a popular tool in Statistical Inference (cs.SI) and Network Science (cs.IT). Therefore, these five categories are the most likely candidates for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
