The proposed joint quantization and feedback strategy involves analyzing the effect of user selection and joint quantization, which could fall under statistical learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper also considers the achievable sum rate using random matrix theory, which is a technique commonly used in multiple antenna systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
