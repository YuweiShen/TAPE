The paper also proposes a novel method for learning interaction-based item embeddings, which involves machine learning and could fall under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. Additionally, the paper mentions natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as word embeddings, which could place it in the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) category.
