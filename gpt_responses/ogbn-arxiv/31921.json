It may also belong to the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category as it explores the parallel capabilities of modern GPGPU applications for high-speed pattern matching. Additionally, it could be classified under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as it presents a compressed failure-less Aho-Corasick algorithm for pattern matching. The paper may also fall under cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) as it discusses the use of off-the-shelf hardware for intrusion detection systems. Finally, it could be categorized under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as it mentions the increasing link speeds and the need for high-speed pattern matching in real-world applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
