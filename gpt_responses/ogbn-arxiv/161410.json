It also discusses the performance and security of these algorithms, which are important aspects of distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also uses a taxonomy to analyze the algorithms, which is a common technique in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses the implications of different issues in consensus algorithms, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE).
