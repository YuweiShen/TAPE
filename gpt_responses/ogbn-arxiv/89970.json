The paper proposes a new fairness notation called \"equality of effort\" and develops algorithms for determining whether an individual or a group of individuals is discriminated in terms of equality of effort. This work is closely related to topics such as algorithmic fairness, causal inference, and optimization, which are covered by several arXiv CS sub-categories. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CY (Computers and Society), which cover topics related to machine learning, fairness, and social implications of technology. The paper also involves causal inference and optimization, which are covered by cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
