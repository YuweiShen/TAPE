This involves formulating penalty terms that regularize the output distribution of the decoder to encourage the satisfaction of validity constraints. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), social and information networks (cs.SI), and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
