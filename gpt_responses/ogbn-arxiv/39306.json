This topic is closely related to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of higher order orthogonal polynomials, which is a common technique in numerical methods (cs.ME). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of optimization methods, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
