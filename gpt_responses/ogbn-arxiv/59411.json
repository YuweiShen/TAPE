The use of ordinal preference information and the focus on approximation algorithms suggest a connection to topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the study of robust algorithms that can handle agents who may lie or provide incomplete information is relevant to the field of social choice theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
