The paper also involves technical results related to information theory (cs.IT) and complexity theory (cs.CC). The applications of the results to digital signature schemes and non-interactive proof systems suggest a connection to distributed systems (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
