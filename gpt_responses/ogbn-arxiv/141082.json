The focus is on developing scalable and accurate algorithms for online feature selection. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions applications in computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR), which are also possible categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
