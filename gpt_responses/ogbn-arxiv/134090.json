The use of recent developments in deep neural networks such as dropout, batch normalization, non-linear activation and inception module suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also involves pre-processing and post-processing steps, which may suggest that it belongs to the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
