The proposed method involves modifying the post-processing phase of object detection, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The method also involves using high-scoring object detections from nearby frames, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) as it involves analyzing and processing data from multiple sources."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
