This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes two new approaches based on these algorithms, which involves training and optimizing the models, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed methods using benchmark datasets, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
