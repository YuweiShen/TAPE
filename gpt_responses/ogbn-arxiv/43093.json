The paper proposes a method for empirically estimating the HP-divergence from random samples and derives a bound on the convergence rate for the Friedman-Rafsky estimator of the HP-divergence. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.ST (Statistics), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
