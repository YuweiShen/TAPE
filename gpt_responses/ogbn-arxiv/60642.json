The paper analyzes the performance of support recovery based on projections onto lower-dimensional space and formulates it as a multiple-hypothesis testing problem. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the importance of the measurement matrix incoherence and the total measurement gain, which suggests that it may belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
