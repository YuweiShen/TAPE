The proposed method uses Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) for predicting the aesthetic score distribution. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the task of predicting aesthetic quality, which is an important aspect of multimedia content. The proposed method can be applied to various multimedia applications such as image and video processing. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel CNN based on the Cumulative distribution with Jensen-Shannon divergence (CJS-CNN) for predicting the aesthetic score distribution. This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a deep learning based approach for predicting aesthetic score distribution, which is an important aspect of human perception. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with the task of predicting aesthetic quality, which is an important aspect of image retrieval and recommendation systems. The proposed method can be applied to improve the performance of such systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
