This problem falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG) and also involves algorithms and complexity (cs.DS, cs.CC). The paper also discusses the duality gap, which is a concept in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and uses combinatorial arguments (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
