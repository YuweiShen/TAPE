Therefore, cs.IR is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with interpretability and explainability of models, which are important topics in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), making cs.LG and cs.AI likely sub-categories as well. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of tree-based models, which are commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), making cs.CL and cs.CV possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
