The use of cache memories and the optimization of cache assignment suggest a possible connection to networking (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SI). The paper also mentions joint cache-channel coding, which is a technique used in multimedia communication (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
