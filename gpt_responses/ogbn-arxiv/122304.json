It also involves the use of neural networks, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-categories of \"cs.LG\" (Machine Learning) and \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of tensors, which could place it in the sub-category of \"cs.NE\" (Neural and Evolutionary Computing).
