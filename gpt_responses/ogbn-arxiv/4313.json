Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the measurement and tracking of channel propagation conditions, which falls under cs.IT (Information Theory). The use of mmWave frequencies for cellular systems is a key aspect of the paper, which is related to cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also discusses the design of efficient control plane applications, which falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper discusses the use of beam tracking and initial access, which is related to cs.AR (Augmented Reality and Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
