This involves optimizing the trajectory of objects in the world frame to recover the metric scale of the tracked object. The paper also discusses the use of an IMU for scale information and builds the proposed system on top of a monocular visual-inertial system. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics and Control), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves optimization and constraint-based methods, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
