The paper also discusses adversarial attacks and their impact on the performance of these algorithms, which falls under computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The proposed method for detecting attacks using the response of hidden layers in the network can be considered as a multimedia (cs.MM) topic. Finally, the paper presents countermeasures to improve the overall robustness of DNN-based face recognition, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
