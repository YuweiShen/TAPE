The paper also draws a novel equivalence between motion planning and the Bayesian active learning paradigm, which suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The algorithm presented in the paper, BISECT, involves probabilistic reasoning and decision making, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions planning problems for mobile robots and manipulators, which suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions real flight data collected from a full scale helicopter, which suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) for processing and analyzing the data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
