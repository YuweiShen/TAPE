The use of radial basis functions as a surrogate model is a technique commonly used in optimization, and the paper focuses on the performance of this approach in the context of hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also mentions the application of the proposed method to computer vision tasks, which suggests cs.CV (Computer Vision) as another possible category. Finally, the use of optimization techniques in control systems is mentioned, which could suggest cs.SY (Systems and Control) as a less likely but still possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
