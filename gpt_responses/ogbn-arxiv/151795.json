This problem is difficult to solve due to its non-convex fractional form, and conventional algorithms have addressed it iteratively for each channel realization, leading to high computational complexity. The paper proposes a new method based on the concept of saturation power, which is parameterized using random matrix theory and relies only on second-order channel statistics, thus reducing computational complexity. The paper involves concepts related to information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), control and systems engineering (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
