The paper presents a clustering approach to solve this problem and introduces a framework called promise correlation clustering. This work is relevant to the sub-category of databases (cs.DB) as well as machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS) due to the clustering approach. Additionally, the paper discusses the complexity of the problem, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
