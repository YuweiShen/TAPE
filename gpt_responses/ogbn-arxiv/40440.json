Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses the initialization of network parameters, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and the training of DNNs on high-dimensional data, which is related to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
