The authors propose a new technique called propagation maps to understand the influence of the perturbation in each layer of the network, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the security implications of the one-pixel attack, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the authors analyze the locality of the vulnerability and reveal that it lies in receptive fields, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
