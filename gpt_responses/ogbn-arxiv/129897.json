The use of evolutionary techniques such as Differential Evolution (DE) is a popular approach in solving path planning problems (cs.AI). The paper also deals with uncertain and time-variant obstacles, which is a common problem in control systems (cs.SY). The use of current map data and the avoidance of collision boundaries suggest the use of computer vision techniques (cs.CV). Finally, the paper mentions the efficiency and speed of the proposed algorithm, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
