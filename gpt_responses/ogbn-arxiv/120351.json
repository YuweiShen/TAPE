This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of Symbolic Computation (cs.SC). Additionally, the paper discusses the algorithms used for projection and lifting, which are commonly used in computational geometry (cs.CG) and optimization (cs.LO). The paper also mentions the use of triangular decomposition, which is a technique used in computational geometry (cs.CG) and computational mathematics (cs.MS). Finally, the paper discusses the functionality of the package, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
