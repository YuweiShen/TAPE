The use of convex optimization techniques also suggests a connection to convex optimization (cs.OH) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). However, since the paper focuses on resource allocation problems, we can rule out some sub-categories such as computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
