The use of the streaming model implies that it may also belong to the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category. The consideration of discrepancy suggests that it may belong to the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-category. The use of randomized algorithms suggests that it may also belong to the computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-category.
