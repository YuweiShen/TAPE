This task is commonly studied in the computational linguistics (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-fields of computer science. The paper also utilizes topic modeling, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for identifying latent topics in text. Finally, the paper mentions the cost-effectiveness of their approach, which suggests a potential application in deep learning (cs.DL) for reducing the need for expensive human annotation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
