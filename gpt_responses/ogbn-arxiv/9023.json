The system also incorporates advances in deep perceptual learning and probabilistic semantic reasoning, which are topics in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions formal results for tracking moving targets, which is a topic in control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper includes a numerical study and physical implementation on both wheeled and legged platforms, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
