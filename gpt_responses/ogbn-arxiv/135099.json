The paper also heavily relies on information theory and statistical methods, which suggests that it could also be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper proposes a new method for estimating transfer entropy that is applicable to non-stationary time series, which could fall under the categories of information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
