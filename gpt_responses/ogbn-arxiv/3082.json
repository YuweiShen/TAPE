The use of regularization methods and numerical optimization techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to computational geometry (cs.CG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the mention of \"intensive numerical experiments\" suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.MM) in terms of evaluating the performance of the proposed method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
