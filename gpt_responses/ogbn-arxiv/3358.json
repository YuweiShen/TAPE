This topic is closely related to the fields of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), as well as computer security (cs.CR) and computer vision (cs.CV), which are concerned with the robustness of machine learning models to adversarial attacks and other forms of input perturbations. Additionally, the paper proposes a methodology that relies on sound abstract versions of SVM classifiers, which can be seen as a form of abstract interpretation (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
