Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions experiments on image datasets, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). The use of priors and their impact on the behavior of parameters suggests a connection to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the generalization capabilities of function estimators, which could place it in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.ST (Statistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
