Additionally, the paper focuses on distributed optimization and network features, which could also place it in the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-categories. The use of optimization algorithms and analysis of network parameters could also suggest a connection to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category.
