Additionally, the use of convolutional neural networks suggests a focus on deep learning techniques commonly used in computer vision. The paper also mentions the existence of shared visual representations, which could fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of neural networks also suggests a focus on the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category.
