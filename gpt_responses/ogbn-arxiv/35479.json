Therefore, the most likely category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses optimization and search algorithms, which are relevant to the sub-categories of cs.GT (Game Theory) and cs.PL (Programming Languages). The use of multi-armed bandits is a common technique in machine learning, which falls under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper discusses the robustness of the discovered algorithms, which is relevant to the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
