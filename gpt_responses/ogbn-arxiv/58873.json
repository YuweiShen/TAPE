The paper also presents empirical evidence and theoretical arguments, suggesting a computational and mathematical approach, respectively, which could place it in cs.GR and cs.SY. Finally, the paper includes a quantitative analysis of the grid peeling process, which involves numerical methods, potentially fitting into cs.NA."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
