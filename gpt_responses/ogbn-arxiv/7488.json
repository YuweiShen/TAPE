Specifically, it proposes the use of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) coupled with the HATSGA algorithm for the fast reconfiguration of large distribution power networks. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
