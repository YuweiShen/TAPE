This involves representing entities with their contextual information in KGs using topic entity graphs, which can be viewed as a graph matching problem. The proposed solution uses graph attention to match entities and derive a graph-level matching vector. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a neural network-based solution for cross-lingual KG alignment, which falls under the scope of AI. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with cross-lingual KG alignment, which involves natural language processing and language translation. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning-based solution for graph matching. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with knowledge graphs, which are often used in information retrieval applications. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper deals with knowledge graphs, which are a type of database."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
