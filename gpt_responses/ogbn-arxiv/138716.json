The system's design and evaluation also involve user studies and interviews with domain experts, which are typical of HCI research.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Anomalies in cloud computing systems can be caused by security breaches or attacks, and detecting such anomalies is crucial for ensuring the security of the systems. Although the paper does not explicitly mention security, it is possible that the developed anomaly detection algorithm and visualization techniques can be applied to security-related data.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): Cloud computing systems are a type of distributed and parallel computing systems, and detecting anomalous performances in such systems is a critical task. The paper's focus on developing an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm and visual analytics system for cloud computing data is relevant to this sub-category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): Cloud computing systems are complex software systems that require careful monitoring and maintenance to ensure their efficient operation. The paper's approach to detecting and diagnosing anomalies in cloud computing systems can be seen as a software engineering task.\n- cs.DB (Databases): Cloud computing systems often involve large amounts of data that need to be stored, processed, and analyzed efficiently. The paper's focus on analyzing performance metrics"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
