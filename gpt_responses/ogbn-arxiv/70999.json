The paper specifically evaluates different engagement layers and patch architectures, which are commonly used in deep learning and computer vision (cs.CV) applications. The paper also discusses the use of inner feature representations in deep networks, which is a common topic in the field of neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the adaptation of neural network models to handle concept drift, which is a common topic in the field of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of heuristics to aid in parametrizing the patching procedure, which is a common topic in the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
