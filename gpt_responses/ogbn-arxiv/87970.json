The paper also discusses the vulnerability of modern detector architectures, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of adversarial attacks involves machine learning techniques, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves extensive evaluations and experiments, which is a common theme in machine learning research (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implementation of the attack, which involves multimedia systems and applications (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
