The paper also involves the use of deep function approximation (cs.AI) and temporal abstraction (cs.RO) to address the challenges of long horizons and continuous states/actions. The paper is specifically focused on teaching policies (cs.MA) and their effectiveness in improving team-wide learning progress.
