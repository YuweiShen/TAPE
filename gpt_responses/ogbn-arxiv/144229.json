The proposed framework also involves deep learning techniques (cs.LG) and system and control theory (cs.SY) to reduce feedback overhead and improve performance. Additionally, the paper focuses on the use of multiple antennas in UE, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
