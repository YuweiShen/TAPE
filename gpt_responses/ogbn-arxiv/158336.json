The use of optimization techniques such as sum-of-squares programming (SOS) suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the focus on safety and feasibility suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
