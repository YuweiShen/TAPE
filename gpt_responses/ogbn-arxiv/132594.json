This falls under the domain of information theory, which is concerned with the fundamental limits of communication systems. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the uplink MU-MIMO systems with NOMA, which is a key technology for future wireless networks. This makes it relevant to the networking and internet architecture community. \n3. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The iterative LMMSE detection is a signal processing technique used for detecting signals in noisy environments. Hence, this paper could be relevant to the signal processing community. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the capacity achieving iterative LMMSE detection for MU-MIMO systems, which is a key technology for multimedia applications such as video streaming and online gaming. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the computational complexity of the iterative LMMSE detection and proposes a low-complexity distributed calculation approach. This could be relevant to the computational engineering community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
