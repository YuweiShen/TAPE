The algorithm uses an actor-critic neural network architecture and a temperature-controlled Sinkhorn layer to produce continuous relaxations of permutation matrices. The empirical results show that the algorithm performs well on sorting, the Euclidean TSP, and matching tasks, indicating that it is relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), computer vision (cs.CV), and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
