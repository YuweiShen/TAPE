The use of reinforcement learning (RL) and advantage actor critic (A2C) algorithms further supports the likelihood of the paper belonging to the cs.LG and cs.AI sub-categories. The applications of the proposed solution to computing systems and operations research suggest the relevance of the paper to the cs.RO and cs.SY sub-categories. Finally, the mention of a large number of concurrent decisions and the use of a vector representation of the decision-making problem suggest a potential connection to the cs.DS sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
