Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) are the most likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses an NLP-based metric to measure semantic distance, which suggests cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as a possible sub-category. The paper also deals with publicly available video datasets, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
