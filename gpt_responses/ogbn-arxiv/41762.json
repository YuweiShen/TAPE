The use of sum-set inequalities based on the aligned image sets approach suggests a possible connection to signal processing (cs.SI) and numerical analysis (cs.NI). The paper also involves optimization techniques, which could place it in the category of mathematical optimization (cs.MM). Finally, the application of the results to wireless communication systems suggests a possible connection to computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
