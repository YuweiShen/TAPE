The focus is on optimizing the transceiver design at the reader and backscattering coefficients at the tags, which involves networking and communication aspects (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the practical utility of the proposed designs in wireless powered communication networks and BSC with imperfect channel state information, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The proposed designs involve optimization techniques and algorithms, which can be categorized under machine learning (cs.MM) and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
