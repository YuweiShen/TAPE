Therefore, cs.VLSI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses attacks on split manufacturing, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The paper proposes a new paradigm for enhancing security, which involves embedding keys in the FEOL layout, which is a software engineering technique (cs.SE). The paper also discusses the security of split manufacturing, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CY). Finally, the paper mentions the ITC'99 benchmarks, which are used to evaluate the performance of VLSI designs (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
