The main building block of the learner is a differentially private algorithm for locating an approximate center point, which is a problem in computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also provides lower bounds on the sample complexity for privately finding a point in the convex hull, which is a problem in computational complexity (cs.CC) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper uses techniques from differential privacy (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
