This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) domains. The paper proposes new models for online video object detection, which involves machine learning techniques such as deep learning (cs.LG) and computer graphics (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of optical flow, which is a common technique in computer vision and machine learning (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
