The use of MIMO and SIMO/MISO models also suggests a focus on signal processing and communication systems (cs.SY). The incorporation of Transmitting Antenna Selection (TAS) and modulation schemes further supports the relevance to Multimedia (cs.MM) and Computer Communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
