It may also belong to the computer graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as the filter is used for smoothing in graphics applications. The use of approximation techniques suggests that it may also belong to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. The mention of operations per pixel suggests that it may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of Gaussian kernels suggests that it may belong to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
