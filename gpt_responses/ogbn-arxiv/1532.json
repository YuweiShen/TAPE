The primary focus is on improving the speed of computation without impacting the quality of the approximation. This topic is closely related to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), and data structures (cs.DS). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
