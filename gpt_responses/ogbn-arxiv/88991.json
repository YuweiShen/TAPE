The analysis is carried out at a large scale, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques (cs.LG). The focus on human decision-making and the use of datasets with millions of recorded games suggests a connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of chess as a model system suggests a connection to game theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper discusses the identification of features that are present in most settings where the analysis of human error is applicable, which suggests a connection to cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
