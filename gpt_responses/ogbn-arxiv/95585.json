The paper also involves the use of a change-of-measure lemma, which is a common tool in probability theory (cs.ITP). The streaming transmission setup is often used in networked systems (cs.NI) and the paper discusses the use of a more powerful decoder, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) or signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
