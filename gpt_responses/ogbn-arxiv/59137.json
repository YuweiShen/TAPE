The paper focuses on the theoretical consistency of the method and proposes a new approach that fills the gap between theoretical consistency and empirical soundness. The paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.ST (Statistics), and cs.CV (Computer Vision) as these sub-categories are closely related to the topic of the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
