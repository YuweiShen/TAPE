Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of homography matrixes and a dual-mode judge mechanism, which are related to robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM) respectively. The paper proposes a framework that utilizes optical flow, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
