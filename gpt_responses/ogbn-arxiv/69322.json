The paper also proposes a novel approach based on deep neural networks, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. The paper involves modeling the dynamics of robot's interactions directly from images, which suggests that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.
