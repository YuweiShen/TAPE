Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of sub-linear variables and reducing space, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The problem of computing visibility areas can also be related to graph theory, which falls under cs.GR (Graph Theory). Finally, the mention of \"critical vertices\" suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
