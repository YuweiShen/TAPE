It could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as Bayesian Optimization is a popular technique in AI research. The paper also discusses the use of a hybrid algorithm that dynamically switches between sequential and batch policies, which could be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the paper presents experimental results on benchmark problems, which could make it relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with optimization, which could make it relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
