The paper also proposes a new approach to improve the performance of multilingual NMT models, which involves adding auxiliary losses to the NMT encoder. This approach is related to deep learning and neural networks, which are covered by the sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper may involve computer vision techniques, which are covered by the sub-category cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
