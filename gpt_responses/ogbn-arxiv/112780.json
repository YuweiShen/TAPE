The technique involves adding shortcut connections with a gating mechanism, which is often used in computer vision tasks (cs.CV). The paper also evaluates the technique on image classification datasets (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), which further supports the relevance to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the design of shortcut connections, which is a topic in natural language processing (cs.CL) as well as computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
