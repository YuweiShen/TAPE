The algorithm involves the intersection of the Pl\\\"\"ucker embedding of the Grassmannian and an algebraic variety, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also discusses connections to finite geometry (cs.DM) and applies the decoding algorithm to Desarguesian spread codes (cs.DS).
