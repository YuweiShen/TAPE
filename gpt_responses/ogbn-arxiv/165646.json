The paper also addresses motion tracking, which falls under robotics (cs.RO). The use of multiple sensors and the proposed calibration method suggest that the paper may also be relevant to graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the evaluation of real-time 3D reconstruction systems, which could be relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
