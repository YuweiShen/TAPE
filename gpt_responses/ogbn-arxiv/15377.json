The paper also discusses the Shannon limit, which is a fundamental concept in information theory.\n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) - The paper discusses the performance of the proposed distribution matching scheme in the context of 5G low-density parity-check codes, which is a topic in communications and networking.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - Although the paper does not explicitly discuss social networks, the concept of distribution matching can be applied in various network settings, including social networks.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper discusses the use of probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS), which is a technique used in machine learning for signal processing.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - Although the paper does not explicitly discuss data structures and algorithms, the concept of shell mapping can be seen as a type of algorithm for distribution matching."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
