The paper also discusses the use of skip pooling and recurrent neural networks, which are techniques commonly used in deep learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper focuses on improving the accuracy of object detection, which is a problem that can be approached using artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of neural networks also falls under the category of neural engineering (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the integration of contextual information, which is a topic that falls under natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
