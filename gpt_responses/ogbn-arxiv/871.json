The use of Lp-samplers involves concepts from information theory (cs.IT) and the finding duplicates problem is a classic problem in data mining (cs.DM). The lower bounds are obtained using reductions from communication complexity (cs.CC) and the application of the samplers to the heavy hitters problem involves concepts from control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
