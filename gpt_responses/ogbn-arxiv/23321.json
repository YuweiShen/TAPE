This involves using human abstracts to obtain question-answer pairs, which suggests a focus on natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) techniques. The paper also mentions using automatic metrics and human assessors to evaluate results, indicating a focus on machine learning (ML) and data science (DS) methods. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The focus on ML and DS methods suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as additional possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
