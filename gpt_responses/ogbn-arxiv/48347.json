The paper proposes efficient solvers for sparse subspace clustering, covering both $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_0$ models, and both linear and affine constraints. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
