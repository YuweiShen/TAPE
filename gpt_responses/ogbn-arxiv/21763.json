This involves managing heterogeneous remote sensing data and exploiting complementarity among different data sensors. The paper focuses on the use of optical VHSR images, which are commonly used for land cover mapping. The proposed method, named MRFusion, aims to avoid information loss induced by pansharpening or any other hand-crafted preprocessing. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of deep learning techniques, which suggests that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also deals with remote sensing data, which suggests that it may belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of land cover mapping, which suggests that it may also belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
