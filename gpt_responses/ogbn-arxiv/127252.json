The proposed receiver architecture is based on sub-Nyquist sampling technology, which is a topic of interest in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the hardware complexity of the proposed architecture, which falls under the category of networked and distributed systems (cs.SI) and network architecture and protocols (cs.NI). The joint DOA and frequency estimation algorithms are based on signal processing techniques, which are covered in the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SP) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
