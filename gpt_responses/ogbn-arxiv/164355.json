The use of the ramp penalty to accurately quantify costs and the efficient algorithm to approximately optimize the resulting non-convex constrained optimization problem suggest that the paper belongs to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the real-world goals of fairness, empirical recall, reducing churn, and stabilizing online training, which are relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer ethics (cs.CE), cryptography and security (cs.CR), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
