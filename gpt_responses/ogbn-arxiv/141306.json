This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed method utilizes genetic programming to synthesize the controller functions and modes. This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Genetic programming is a type of machine learning, which is utilized in the proposed method.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper mentions that the proposed methodology is demonstrated on multiple systems, which could potentially include robotic systems.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper mentions the use of a Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver to verify the correctness of the synthesized controllers. This falls under the scope of programming languages."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
