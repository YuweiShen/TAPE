The paper also discusses the implementation of trapdoors using strategies similar to backdoor/Trojan attacks, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The experiments conducted in the paper involve image recognition, face recognition, and traffic sign recognition, which fall under the categories of computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses potential countermeasures and mitigations, which fall under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
