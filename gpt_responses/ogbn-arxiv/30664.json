This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of embeddings to learn richer notions of compatibility, which suggests that it may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories.
