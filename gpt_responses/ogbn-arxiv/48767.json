Therefore, cs.IR is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of a dictionary, which is a data structure commonly used in data structures (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB). The paper also mentions the use of LZ77-like encoding, which is a common technique in data compression (cs.DL). Finally, the paper discusses the trade-off between compression effectiveness and retrieval times, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
