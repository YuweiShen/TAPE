This suggests that the paper could belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) category. The paper also discusses the problem of knowledge management and visualization in data mining, which suggests that it could belong to the Databases (cs.DB) category. The paper proposes a new approach called \"knowledge map\" to manage mined knowledge, which suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), or Deep Learning (cs.DL) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
