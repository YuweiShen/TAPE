It also introduces the concept of decreasing monomial-Cartesian codes, which are a type of error-correcting code (cs.CC). The paper uses algebraic techniques to analyze these codes, which could fall under the sub-categories of algebraic geometry (cs.AG) or algebraic combinatorics (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the application of these codes to symmetric channels, which could fall under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses a partial order inspired by recent work in polynomial formalism, which could fall under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
