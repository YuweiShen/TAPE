Information theory is a natural fit for this kind of work.\n2. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses deep neural networks to learn the transceiver for the multiuser degraded broadcast channel. This makes cs.NE a likely category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses machine learning techniques, specifically deep auto-encoders, to solve the communication system problem. This makes cs.LG a likely category.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with a communication system problem and proposes a solution using deep auto-encoders. Systems and control is a possible category for this kind of work.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with a communication system problem and proposes a solution using deep auto-encoders.
