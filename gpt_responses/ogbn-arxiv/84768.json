The problem is studied in the context of digraphs, which are a common object of study in computer science. The paper also discusses the complexity of the problem for different classes of digraphs, such as acyclic and reflexive multipartite tournaments, which are well-studied objects in graph theory. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), which are all relevant to the topics discussed in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
