It also addresses the issue of achieving strong secrecy, which is a concern in cryptography (cs.CR). The use of polar codes and universal hashing suggests a connection to coding theory (cs.CC) and randomness extraction (cs.SI). Finally, the paper may have applications in multimedia security (cs.MM) due to the increasing need for secure communication in multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
