The paper also discusses the use of oblivious RAM and concurrency control mechanisms, which are relevant to the categories cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also mentions the performance gains achieved by the system, which is relevant to the categories cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
