Therefore, cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) is a likely sub-category. The paper also proposes techniques based on simulation relations, which are commonly used in verification and model checking. Hence, cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.PL (Programming Languages) are also possible sub-categories.

Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
