This involves modeling autonomous thermalling as a POMDP and implementing it as part of ArduPlane, a popular open-source autopilot. The paper thus falls under the category of Robotics (cs.RO) as it deals with the development of autonomous control algorithms for sUAVs. It also involves the use of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) techniques such as POMDPs for modeling the problem and developing the controller. The paper also deals with control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves the development of a receding-horizon controller and the use of machine learning techniques for training the controller. Finally, the paper involves computer vision (cs.CV) as it uses visual sensors for detecting thermals during flight tests."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
