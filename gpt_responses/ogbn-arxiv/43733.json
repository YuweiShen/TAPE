The experiments are conducted on image classification and object detection tasks, indicating a focus on computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the limitations of existing normalization methods and proposes a new approach that addresses these limitations, indicating a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper involves training deep neural networks, indicating a focus on neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper involves natural language processing tasks, indicating a possible focus on computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
