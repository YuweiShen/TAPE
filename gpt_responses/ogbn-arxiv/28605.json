The use of decision fusion and Expectation-Maximization methods also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions the classification of glioma and non-small-cell lung carcinoma cases, which suggests a potential focus on medical imaging (cs.IR). Finally, the use of gigapixel resolution Whole Slide Tissue Images (WSI) suggests a potential focus on multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
