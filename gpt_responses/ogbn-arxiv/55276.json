Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the analysis of running time and approximation algorithms, which are common topics in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The use of polygonal curves to model protein backbones suggests a connection to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), while the study of discrete Fr\\'echet distance has applications in cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
