The use of compressed sensing techniques is a key aspect of the proposed method, which suggests that the paper could be relevant to the information theory (cs.IT) and data structures (cs.DS) communities as well. The paper also mentions applications in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), which further supports these potential sub-categories. However, given the focus on developing a general theory and providing robustness guarantees, we believe that the machine learning sub-category (cs.LG) is the most likely fit for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
