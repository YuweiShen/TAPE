The proposed technique uses raw signal data as input, which is then processed using deep convolutional neural networks (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of neural networks for classification tasks (cs.NE) and the application of the technique in condition-based maintenance (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
