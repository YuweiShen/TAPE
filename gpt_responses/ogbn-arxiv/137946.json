It is also likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories as it proposes a new operation for convolutional networks. The paper may also be relevant to the Graphics (cs.GR) category as it deals with 3D point clouds obtained using a LiDAR scanner or RGB-D camera. Finally, it may be relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category as it proposes a new method for reducing computation in convolutional networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
