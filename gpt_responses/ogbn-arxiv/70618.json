The analysis of local publishers and the likelihood of works being local may involve the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques (cs.DL). Information retrieval (cs.IR) may also be used to gather data on local publishers and their inclusion of works by scientists. The exploration of sociocultural benefits from academia may involve the use of statistical methods and data analysis (cs.LG). Finally, the analysis of local activities and geographic dimensions may involve the use of spatial data analysis and visualization (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
