The use of epistemic formulas and announcements also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The focus on how knowledge changes after announcements could also be relevant to multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and game theory (cs.GT). Finally, the use of infinitary axiomatisation suggests a connection to mathematical logic (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
