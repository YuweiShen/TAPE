The paper also mentions the NP-completeness of digraph list homomorphism problems, which is a well-known result in theoretical computer science (cs.CC, cs.DS). The paper's focus on tree-like trigraphs suggests that it may fall under the category of graph theory (cs.GT) or combinatorics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
