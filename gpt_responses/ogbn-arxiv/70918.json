Additionally, it involves network infrastructure (cs.NI) as it identifies and classifies mining websites in a large number of domains. It also involves distributed computing (cs.DC) as it studies the mining process and the contribution of different mining pools. Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) is also a possible category as the paper discusses the impact of browser-based mining on website operators and users. Finally, Cybersecurity (cs.CY) is another possible category as the paper discusses the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with browser-based mining."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
