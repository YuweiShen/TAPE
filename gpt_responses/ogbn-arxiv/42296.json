This involves human subject experiments in a simulated vehicle pursuit task, which suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of regenerative braking also suggests a focus on robotics (cs.RO) and cybernetics (cs.CYBER). Finally, the study involves the evaluation of driving conditions, which could fall under the category of emerging technologies (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
