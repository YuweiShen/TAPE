The method is applicable to a wide variety of potential functions, which suggests it could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the method, which could make it relevant to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
