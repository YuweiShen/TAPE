The paper also introduces a metric topology to the compressed domain, which is a topic related to data structures (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper discusses the trade-off between compression efficiency and malleability cost, which is a topic related to coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper characterizes achievable rates and malleability as the solution of a subgraph isomorphism problem, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
