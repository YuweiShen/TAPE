The proposed method involves a decomposition algorithm, which is a common technique in machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG). The paper also discusses a fast score computation technique, which is relevant to natural language processing and information retrieval (cs.CL, cs.IR). Finally, the paper deals with the issue of model size, which is a concern in database systems (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
