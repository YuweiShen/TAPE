The paper also compares the proposed method with other supervised dimensionality reduction techniques, which are commonly used in computer science research areas such as machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, these five categories are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
