The use of algorithms and the mention of a polynomial-time algorithm suggest that it could also belong to the Computational Geometry (cs.CG) sub-category, but since the paper does not explicitly deal with geometric problems, this is less likely. The paper also deals with budgeting, which suggests that it could belong to the Cybernetics (cs.CY) sub-category. The use of algorithms and the mention of a polynomial-time algorithm suggest that it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories.
