Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by information retrieval (cs.IR) and computational linguistics (cs.CL) since the paper deals with text and layout analysis. The use of deep learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks and gated recurrent units suggests that the paper may also belong to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
