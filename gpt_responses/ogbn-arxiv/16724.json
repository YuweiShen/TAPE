The paper proposes a cache-based approach to modeling coherence, which involves storing and utilizing contextual information from recently translated sentences or the entire document. This approach involves the use of neural models and machine learning techniques, which are commonly associated with sub-categories such as computational linguistics (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves the use of probabilistic models and scoring mechanisms, which are also relevant to sub-categories such as information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
