The use of polar interpolation is a novel technique that improves the precision of the parameter estimation, which could be of interest to researchers in the sub-category of numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the focus on translation-invariant signals suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the sub-category of statistical inference (cs.SI), which deals with estimating parameters in models with unknown translations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
