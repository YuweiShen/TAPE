This involves investigating the trade-off among the transmission rate, decoding error probability, and the transmission latency measured in blocklength. The paper also proposes a 1-D search algorithm to resolve the challenges mainly due to the achievable rate affected by the finite blocklength and the unguaranteed successive interference cancellation. The paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories, as it deals with optimizing communication systems, transmission rates, and power allocation, which are relevant to these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
