The paper also focuses on evaluating artificial systems for tasks that are sensitive to individual differences, which suggests a human-centered approach and falls under human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of a probabilistic model and computation method for judgment suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) approach. Finally, the task of ranking image pairs according to material attributes of objects suggests information retrieval (cs.IR) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
