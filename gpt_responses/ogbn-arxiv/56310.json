This topic falls under several sub-categories of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), augmented reality (cs.AR), systems and control (cs.SY), and software engineering (cs.SE). However, given the focus on wireless communication protocols and the programmability and flexibility of SDR, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely sub-categories. The other sub-categories are less likely but still relevant to the paper's content."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
