The study of bidirectional communication in a cooperative wireless network also falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the performance comparison between different relaying schemes, which involves signal processing and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also discusses the energy efficiency of the proposed system, which is related to computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
