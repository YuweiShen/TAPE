The use of central pattern generators and sensory feedback in the control system design suggests a focus on neural networks and embodied systems (cs.NE and cs.SY). The use of evolutionary optimization also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
