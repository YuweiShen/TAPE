This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the network topology and its impact on the delivery scheme, which is related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with the optimization of the delivery scheme, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
