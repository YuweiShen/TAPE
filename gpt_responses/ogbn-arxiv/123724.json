The paper proposes a new loss function for NMT training, which involves optimizing model parameters to balance generalization ability and error avoidance. This suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the sub-categories of \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG) and \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI), which are closely related to NMT and involve optimizing models for specific tasks. Additionally, the paper uses empirical evaluations to compare the proposed loss function to several baselines, which suggests that it could also be relevant to the sub-categories of \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE) and \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\" (cs.CV), which often involve empirical evaluations of machine learning models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
