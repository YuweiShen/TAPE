The focus on risk-sensitive objectives and constraints suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of control systems (cs.SY) and robotics (cs.RO), as these fields often deal with decision making under uncertainty. Finally, the use of synthetic datasets and the numerical experiment suggest that the paper may also fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
