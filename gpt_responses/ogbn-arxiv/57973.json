Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the compatibility of the proposed system with current datacenter infrastructures, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The proposed system involves programmable switches, which may also relate to cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper discusses the performance improvement gained from the proposed system, which may also relate to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
