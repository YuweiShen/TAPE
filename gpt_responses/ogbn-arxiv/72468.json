Therefore, cs.CL is the most likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with extracting sentiment from large volumes of social data, which involves information retrieval techniques such as crawling, indexing, and searching. Hence, cs.IR is also a likely sub-category.\n\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with social media data, which is a type of social network data. Therefore, cs.SI is another likely sub-category.\n\n4. cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper describes the development of an enterprise system for sentiment analysis, which involves software engineering techniques such as system design, implementation, and testing. Hence, cs.SD is also a possible sub-category.\n\n5. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the value of enriching sentiment results with user profiles in understanding sentiments of a specific user group, which falls under the domain of social computing. Therefore, cs.CY is another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
