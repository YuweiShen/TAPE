Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also addresses security issues related to SDN, which suggests a possible fit with cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The optimization of SDN control overhead involves system-level design and resource allocation, which could be relevant to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also discusses the need for interoperability with existing protocol stacks, which could be related to cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed framework in terms of latency, energy, and packet delivery, which suggests a possible fit with cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
