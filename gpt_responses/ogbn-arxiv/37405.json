It also involves distortion analysis, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of multiple users in the broadcast channel suggests a possible connection to networking (cs.NI), and the discussion of outer bounds may involve complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
