The paper also mentions the use of auxiliary learners to learn distributional information about the update targets online, which is a common technique in machine learning. Additionally, the paper discusses the empirical evaluation of the proposed algorithm, which is a common practice in machine learning research. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY) as it deals with reinforcement learning and policy evaluation, which are common topics in these sub-fields. \n\nFurthermore, the paper could be relevant to the sub-category of robotics (cs.RO) as reinforcement learning is often used in robotics for tasks such as navigation and manipulation. \n\nFinally, the paper could be relevant to the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE) as it discusses the use of function approximation in TD-learning, which often involves the use of neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
