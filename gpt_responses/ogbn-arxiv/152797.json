The use of deep learning techniques to learn features rather than a map suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper may also involve natural language processing (cs.CL) if it discusses the use of language to describe and navigate environments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
