The use of probabilistic programming for efficient inference is also relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The discussion of generative models and declarative knowledge is related to neural networks (cs.NE) and cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
