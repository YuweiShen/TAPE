The proposed protocols involve switching between energy harvesting (EH) and information transmission (IT), which requires system-level optimization and control (SY). The paper also discusses the achievable throughput, which involves performance evaluation and modeling (MM) techniques. Finally, the paper proposes practical protocols that can be implemented in real-world communication systems, which falls under computer engineering (CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
