The paper also discusses the structure of the information rate of a fading channel, which is relevant to network information theory (cs.NI) and communication theory (cs.COMM). The use of the Gaussian-Markov process suggests a focus on stochastic processes and statistical inference (cs.SI), while the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the user information rate suggests a focus on mathematical analysis (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
