This involves training an RL agent to replace less important memories in an external memory, and encoding the memory using either the GRU or Transformer architecture. This work involves natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques, which are typically covered in the arXiv sub-categories of cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the use of deep neural networks for learning representations and making predictions suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the use of streaming data and the focus on question answering suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
