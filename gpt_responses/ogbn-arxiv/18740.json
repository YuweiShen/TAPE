The paper also discusses practical scheduling schemes based on signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) feedback, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper presents new analysis of MRC, ZF and MMSE receivers, which are topics related to machine learning (cs.MM) and learning theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
