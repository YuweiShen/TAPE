The use of a neural network heuristic to guide the search algorithm suggests that the paper may also fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of a Tree-LSTM recursive neural network for learning a distributed representation of expressions suggests that the paper may also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also deals with reconstructing proofs of equivalence, which suggests that it may fall under the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with finding paths of equivalence preserving transformations, which suggests that it may also fall under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
