Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the energy and spectral efficiency of the system, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of extreme-value theory, which is a statistical method used in machine learning and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of multihop relaying on the system, which is a topic in computer networks (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
