This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also proposes metrics to evaluate explanations, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories.
