The paper introduces versions of the iterative hard thresholding algorithm for several tensor decompositions, and provides a partial convergence result based on a variant of the restricted isometry property of the measurement operator adapted to the tensor decomposition at hand. The paper also shows that subgaussian measurement ensembles satisfy the tensor restricted isometry property with high probability under a certain almost optimal bound on the number of measurements which depends on the corresponding tensor format. Overall, the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of arXiv CS, including information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), numerical analysis (cs.NA), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
