The paper presents lower bounds on the integrality gap for strong semidefinite programs, which are commonly used in approximation algorithms. This suggests that the problem is difficult to approximate within polynomial factors, which is a topic of interest in the areas of data structures, computational complexity, computational geometry, information theory, and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
