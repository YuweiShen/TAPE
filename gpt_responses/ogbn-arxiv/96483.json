However, given the focus on communication and coding, as well as the use of secure cross subspace alignment (SCSA), it is most likely to be classified under Information Theory (cs.IT). Other possible sub-categories include Cryptography and Security (cs.CR), Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
