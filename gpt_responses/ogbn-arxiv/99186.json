The use of deep reinforcement learning and interactive RL also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The AUV's ability to adapt to a changing environment and learn from both human and environmental rewards suggests a potential focus on control systems (cs.SY) and computer vision (cs.CV) for environmental perception."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
