The paper proposes a new method that exploits the property of shape recurrency and reduces NRSfM problems to rigid ones provided that certain recurrency condition is satisfied. The paper also develops efficient algorithms for automatic recurrency detection and camera view clustering via a rigidity-check. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV), graphics (cs.GR), robotics (cs.RO), multimedia (cs.MM), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
