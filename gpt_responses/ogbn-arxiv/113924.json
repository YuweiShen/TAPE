This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT), signal processing (cs.SP), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of sparse recovery algorithms, which is a popular topic in compressed sensing (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper analyzes the noise statistics of the co-prime arrays, which could fall under the sub-category of statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
