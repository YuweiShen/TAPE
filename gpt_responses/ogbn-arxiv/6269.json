The proposed methods involve modifications to the initialization and attention sublayers of the Transformer, which are related to optimization and training of deep neural networks, and thus could also be relevant to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) categories. Additionally, the paper mentions experiments on image captioning, which suggests a potential connection to the cs.CV (Computer Vision) category. Finally, the paper uses empirical analysis and proposes novel techniques, which could also be relevant to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
