It may also belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category as it discusses the potential security risks associated with dynamic updates. Additionally, it could be classified under Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) as it deals with distributed controllers. The paper also involves designing protocols for consistent behavior during the transition, which could fall under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper presents a prototype implementation called Morpheus, which could be classified under Programming Languages (cs.PL) as it involves developing primitives for implementing correct updates."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
