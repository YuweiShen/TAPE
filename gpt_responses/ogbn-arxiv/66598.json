The use of differential privacy (L-DP) is also a common technique in privacy-preserving data analysis (cs.LG). The paper also deals with the optimization of mechanisms for specific classes of sources, which could fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper could also be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI), as privacy is a crucial concern in the analysis of network data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
