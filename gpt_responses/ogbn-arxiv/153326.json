The paper focuses on query-based scenario construction, which falls under the sub-category of natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also uses clustering techniques to group similar events together, which falls under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also uses neural network models to achieve high performance, which falls under the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with evaluating the performance of the model, which falls under the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
