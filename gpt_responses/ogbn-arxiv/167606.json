The paper also mentions the well-founded semantics and the Fitting (or Kripke-Kleene) semantics, which are topics in programming languages (cs.PL) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper aims to provide a coherent picture of relations between different semantics for normal logic programs, which is a topic in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
