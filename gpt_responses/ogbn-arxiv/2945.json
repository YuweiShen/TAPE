The paper discusses the design and implementation of a hierarchical distributed network security management system (HD-NSMS) to centrally manage security across networks. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with network security management, which is a key aspect of networking and internet architecture. The paper proposes a system that can manage security across networks and improve the efficiency of security administration. \n\n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the design and implementation of a network security management system, which involves software engineering principles and practices. The paper describes the system in macrostructure and microstructure and discusses key problems related to device model, alert mechanism, and emergency response mechanism. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a hierarchical distributed network security management system (HD-NSMS), which involves the control and management of network security across multiple networks. The paper discusses the implementation of the system and its effectiveness in managing network security. \n\n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a hierarchical distributed network security management system (HD-NSMS), which involves the management of network security across multiple networks. The paper discusses the implementation of the system and its effectiveness in"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
