This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of spatial correlation to reduce pilot contamination interference, which is a topic in statistical learning and inference (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper proposes algorithms for transmit power optimization, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
