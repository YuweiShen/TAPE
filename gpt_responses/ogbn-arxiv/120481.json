Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the characteristics of suitable eviction policies for ICN, which involves analyzing and managing data structures, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the security implications of cache management policies, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper discusses the usability time of content, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper proposes a new eviction scheme, which could fall under cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
