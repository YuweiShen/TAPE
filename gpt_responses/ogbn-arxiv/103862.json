This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also introduces a new type of intrinsic reward that takes into account statistics over complete trajectories, which involves analyzing visual inputs (cs.CV). The use of hierarchical intrinsic drives also suggests a connection to robotics (cs.RO) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
