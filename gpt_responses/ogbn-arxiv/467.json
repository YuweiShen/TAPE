The paper focuses on the use of pre-defined sparsity to reduce the number of parameters in fully connected layers of a neural network. This topic is closely related to the field of neural networks (cs.NE) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the effects of pre-defining the sparsity of networks with only fully connected layers, which is related to the field of computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper introduces a new metric to characterize the quality of a particular connection pattern, which is related to the field of natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
