This is a core topic in digital circuit design, making cs.DC the most likely category.\n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper discusses the trade-offs involved in introducing redundant logic and how it affects the design metrics of the circuit. This is a topic that falls under hardware architecture.\n- cs.ET (Embedded Systems): The paper discusses the implementation of the circuit in a semi-custom design style using a CMOS digital cell library, which is a common approach in embedded systems design.\n- cs.EM (Electromagnetics): The paper briefly mentions the impact of introducing redundant logic on internal nodes and faults, which could be related to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and susceptibility (EMS) issues.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): While the paper is primarily focused on hardware design, it does discuss the estimation of fault masking capability using a truth-cum-fault enumeration table, which could be considered a software engineering technique."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
