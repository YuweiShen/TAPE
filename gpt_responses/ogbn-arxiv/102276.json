The paper also discusses the use of skip connections and network in network (NIN) structures, which are commonly used in deep learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the optimization of the number of layers and filters, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with image processing, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the reduction of calculation cost, which is a common goal in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
