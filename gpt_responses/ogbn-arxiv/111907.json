The authors derive closed-form expressions for bit error probability and analyze the optimum threshold value to minimize it. This suggests that the paper is related to information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed technique involves intra-cell user forwarding the symbols of cell-edge user after SIC. This suggests that the paper is related to networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed technique involves controlling the forwarding of symbols based on a pre-determined threshold value. This suggests that the paper is related to systems and control.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The authors analyze the performance of the proposed technique for various modulation constellations. This suggests that the paper is related to multimedia.\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly mention any cryptographic or security-related techniques. However, the proposed technique may have implications for the security of cooperative-NOMA networks. This suggests that the paper may be related to cryptography and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
