The paper discusses strategies for annotating datasets for question answering tasks, which falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP). The paper also mentions the use of machine learning models for annotation, which suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the model on unseen datasets, which relates to information retrieval (IR) and the evaluation of NLP models. Finally, the case study focuses on domain customization of QA to a clinical setting, which suggests a potential focus on cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
