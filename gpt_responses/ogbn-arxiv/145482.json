It proposes a hierarchical adaptive semantic-visual tree (ASVT) to depict the architecture of merchandise categories and evaluates semantic similarities between different semantic levels and visual similarities within the same semantic class simultaneously. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the integration of semantic information to regularize the margins, which could also relate to Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a new dataset and uses experimental results to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, which could relate to Multimedia (cs.MM) and Computation and Language (cs.CL) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
