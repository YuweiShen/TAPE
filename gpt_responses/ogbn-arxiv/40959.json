This falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also uses neural networks and meta-learning techniques, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with low-resource settings, which is a common problem in neural network-based approaches and falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with information retrieval (IR) in the sense that it involves mapping natural language queries to structured data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
