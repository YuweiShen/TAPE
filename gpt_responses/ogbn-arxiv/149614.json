Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also evaluates the effectiveness of explainable AI (XAI) approaches in improving usability, trust, and understanding of AI systems, which falls under the scope of cs.AI. Additionally, the paper uses experiments to probe explanation effectiveness in terms of improving user prediction accuracy, confidence, and reliance, which relates to human-computer interaction (HCI) and machine learning (ML) evaluation, hence cs.HCI and cs.LG are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
