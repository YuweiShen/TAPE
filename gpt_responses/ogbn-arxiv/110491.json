The proposed method incorporates instance information and improves multi-instance transfiguration, which involves learning the identity function outside of target instances, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also introduces a sequential mini-batch inference/training technique, which could be relevant to graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
