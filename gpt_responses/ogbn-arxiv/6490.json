The paper also involves communication complexity, which is a topic in Information Theory (cs.IT). The lower bound result is obtained using techniques from graph theory and combinatorics, which are relevant to the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also involves networked systems, which is a topic in Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI).
