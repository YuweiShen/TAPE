The algorithm presented in the paper involves preprocessing and uses the discrete Gaussian distribution, which are topics that fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), respectively. The paper also involves the study of lattice properties, which falls under cs.LG (Lattice-based Cryptography and Security).
