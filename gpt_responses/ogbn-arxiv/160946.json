Therefore, cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses memory constraints and complexity, which are topics related to data structures (cs.DS) and complexity theory (cs.CC). The use of decidable conditions and algorithms suggests a connection to logic (cs.LO) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
