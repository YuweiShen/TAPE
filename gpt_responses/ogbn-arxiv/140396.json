The use of type classes to capture the hierarchy of number systems also involves logical concepts. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the implementation of exact real arithmetic in Coq, which is a programming language and proof assistant. The use of type classes to define abstract specifications of number systems is also a programming language concept. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper involves the formalization of real numbers and their properties in Coq, which can be seen as a formal language. The use of type classes to define abstract specifications of number systems can also be seen as a formal language concept. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the implementation of exact real arithmetic in Coq, which involves the use of data structures such as dyadic rationals and fast rational numbers. The development of algorithms for computing functions such as sine and cosine is also discussed. \n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation and Computer Algebra): The paper involves the development of a library for exact real arithmetic in Coq, which can be seen as a form of symbolic computation. The implementation of functions such as sine and cosine also involves symbolic manipulation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
