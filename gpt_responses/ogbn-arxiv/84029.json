This falls under the scope of natural language processing, which is a subfield of CS.CL.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes the concept of explainable predictive coding, which is a type of AI system. The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques for document review, which is a common application of AI in the legal industry.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of machine learning techniques like text classification and predictive coding for document review in the legal industry. This falls under the scope of CS.LG.\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the process of identifying, collecting, and analyzing large quantities of data for legal document review. This falls under the scope of information retrieval, which is a subfield of CS.IR.\n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although the paper does not directly discuss cryptography or security, it does mention the need for companies to dedicate an extraordinary level of resources to document review in order to comply with lawsuits and regulatory investigations. This could potentially involve sensitive information and data security measures, which falls under the scope of CS.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
