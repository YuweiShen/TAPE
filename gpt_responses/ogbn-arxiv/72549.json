This suggests that cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.IT (Information Theory) are likely categories. The paper also involves concepts from discrete mathematics (such as Gowers norms) and algorithms for computing collections of polynomials, which could place it in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Finally, the paper mentions applications to computational geometry, which could suggest cs.CG (Computational Geometry) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
