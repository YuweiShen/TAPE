The paper proposes a pipeline to map unseen target samples into the synthetic domain used to train task-specific methods. This involves denoising the data and retaining only the features these recognition algorithms are familiar with. The paper also introduces a custom generative network which fully utilizes the purely geometrical information to learn robust features and achieve a more refined mapping for unseen color images. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.GR (Graphics), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
