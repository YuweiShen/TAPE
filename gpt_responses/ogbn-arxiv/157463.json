The use of neural tangent kernels is also a common technique in this field. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses the theoretical aspects of deep learning, which could place it in the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
