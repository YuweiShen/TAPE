Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also focuses on improving the efficiency of the network, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the use of dilated convolutions and separable factorized residual blocks suggests that it could also belong to cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
