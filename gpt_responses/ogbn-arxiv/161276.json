Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of CNN-based object detectors, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper formulates the problem as a Quickest Detection problem, which is related to decision theory and optimization, and could fall under the categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.RO (Robotics). Finally, the paper discusses the computational cost of the proposed method, which could fall under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
