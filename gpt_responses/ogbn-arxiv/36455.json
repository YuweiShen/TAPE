The paper discusses various configurations of SplitNN that cater to practical settings of entities holding different modalities of patient data, centralized and local health entities collaborating on multiple tasks, and learning without sharing labels. The paper compares the performance and resource efficiency trade-offs of SplitNN with other distributed deep learning methods like federated learning, large batch synchronous stochastic gradient descent, and shows highly encouraging results for SplitNN. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
