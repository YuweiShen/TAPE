Information theory is concerned with the transmission, processing, and storage of information, which is relevant to the proposed scheme. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the feasibility of full-duplex large-scale MIMO cellular systems, which are relevant to networking and internet architecture. \n\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper considers two multicell scenarios and derives an analytic model for the ergodic achievable sum-rate, which involves system modeling and control. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the performance of full-duplex large-scale MIMO cellular systems in terms of sum-rate, which is relevant to multimedia applications that require high data rates. \n\n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): The paper does not directly address social or ethical issues related to computing, but it may have implications for the design and deployment of cellular systems that affect society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
