The authors also mention fine-tuning the network for specific semantic classes, which involves machine learning techniques such as transfer learning and fine-tuning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of existing image classifiers, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a new neural network architecture, which is a common topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
