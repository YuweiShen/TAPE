This suggests that the paper may belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing sub-category.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses how the proposed system architecture can promote social good in user mobility. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Computers and Society sub-category.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions the usage of Zero Knowledge Proof to provide necessary privacy guarantees. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Cryptography and Security sub-category.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the usage of IOTA and IPFS to store and certify data coming from sensors or by the users themselves. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture sub-category.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses how the proposed system architecture can promote social good in user mobility.
