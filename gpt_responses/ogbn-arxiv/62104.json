The Shapley-Shubik index is a well-known power index in game theory, and the paper provides an axiomatization of a power measure for games with interval decisions. \n2. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper discusses the discretization of the Shapley-Shubik index for games with interval decisions, which involves discrete mathematics. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper's focus on power distribution in committee systems may have applications in artificial intelligence, particularly in multi-agent systems. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper's focus on power distribution in committee systems may also have applications in machine learning, particularly in the development of fair and transparent decision-making algorithms. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper's focus on power distribution in committee systems may have implications for social networks and information networks, particularly in the study of influence and decision-making in these networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
