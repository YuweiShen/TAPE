The use of chaos-based pseudo-random bit sequences is a field of research in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also proposes an application for secure image transmission, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). The use of discrete chaotic iterations is a method commonly used in control systems (cs.SY) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Therefore, these five categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
