The paper proposes a method to guide the robot to the final grasp pose using image-based visual servoing. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision) - The paper uses RGB-D cameras to provide depth information for grasping non-stationary objects. The proposed method also uses image-based visual servoing, which is a computer vision technique. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a method to predict the image-plane coordinates of observed image features at the final grasp pose. This involves some form of learning or prediction, which falls under the purview of machine learning. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes a method to guide the robot to the final grasp pose using image-based visual servoing. This involves some form of decision-making or planning, which falls under the purview of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a method to guide the robot to the final grasp pose using image-based visual servoing. This involves some form of control or feedback, which falls under the purview of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
