Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses deep neural networks, which are a popular tool in natural language processing (NLP), so cs.CL (Computation and Language) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of LSTM blocks, which are a type of recurrent neural network, so cs.LG (Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with text recognition, which is a problem in information retrieval, so cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
