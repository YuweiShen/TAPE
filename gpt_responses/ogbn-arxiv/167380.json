Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves pooling techniques and normalization, which are common in machine learning and deep learning, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper involves retrieval benchmarks, indicating that it could belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
