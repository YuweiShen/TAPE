The paper specifically focuses on addressing practical difficulties when operating on high-dimensional parameter spaces in extreme low-data regimes, which is a common challenge in machine learning and computer vision research. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG and cs.CV, followed by cs.AI, cs.CL, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
