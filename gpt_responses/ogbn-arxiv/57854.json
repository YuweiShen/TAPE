The focus on information science and library science suggests cs.DL as the most likely sub-category. The use of percentile ranks and citation curves suggests cs.IR (information retrieval) and cs.CY (computational complexity and cryptography) as other likely sub-categories. The mention of policy implications suggests cs.SI (social and information networks) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the use of normalization and integration of citation curves suggests cs.CR (computational geometry) as a less likely but still possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
