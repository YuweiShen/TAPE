Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multi-task learning algorithms, which are related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, so cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories.
