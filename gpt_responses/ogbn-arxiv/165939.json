Additionally, the paper deals with the analysis of polar codes, which are a type of error-correcting code, indicating that it could also be classified under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.SI (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses the relation among block length, gap to capacity, and block error probability, which could potentially place it under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
