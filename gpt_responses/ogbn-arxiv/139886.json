The focus on treewidth and minor-free graphs suggests that it may also belong to the cs.CG (Computational Geometry) category. The paper also mentions property testing algorithms, which are often studied in the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) category. The applications to matching, vertex cover, and dominating set suggest that the paper may also belong to the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) category.
