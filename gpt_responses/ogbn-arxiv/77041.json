The cellular channel is a type of wireless network, which falls under the Networked Systems (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also discusses interference and signal processing techniques, which are relevant to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The use of linear deterministic models and Gaussian counterparts suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions multi-user gain and signal scale alignment, which are relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
