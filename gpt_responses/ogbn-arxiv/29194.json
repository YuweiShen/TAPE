The use of arithmetic Fuchsian groups suggests a connection to coding theory (cs.CC) and algebraic geometry (cs.AG). The mention of decoding complexity suggests a connection to signal processing (cs.SI) and network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the use of logarithmic decoding complexity suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
