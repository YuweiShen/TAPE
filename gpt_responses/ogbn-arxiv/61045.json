It also discusses the optimality of the Kalman filter algorithm, which is a well-known algorithm in control theory (cs.SY). The paper proposes a coding scheme that reduces coding complexity and delay, which is relevant to coding theory (cs.AC). The paper also includes a numerical example, which suggests that it may involve machine learning (cs.MM) or statistical learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
