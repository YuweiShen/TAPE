The paper presents a new data structure called top trees, which is a simpler interface for maintaining information in fully dynamic trees. The paper also demonstrates the versatility of top trees by showing how they can be used in a variety of applications, such as maintaining the diameter, center, and median of each tree in the forest, supporting nearest common ancestor queries and level ancestor queries, and computing distances to a nearest marked vertex. These applications suggest that the paper could be classified under several different arXiv CS sub-categories, including data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational geometry (cs.CG), machine learning (cs.DL), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
