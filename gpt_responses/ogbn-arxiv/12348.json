Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of neural networks, which suggests that it could be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the model on controlled materials from psycholinguistic experiments, which could be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
