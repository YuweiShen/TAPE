Given that the paper specifically focuses on neural nets for object recognition, it is most likely to fall under cs.CV and cs.LG. However, since the paper presents a general framework for model compression that can be applied to various types of models, it could also be relevant to cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
