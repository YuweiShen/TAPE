The use of joint source-channel coding and the proposed coding scheme based on low-density parity-check codes suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and communication (cs.COMM). Finally, the analysis of the performance of the proposed coding scheme using multi-edge density evolution suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
