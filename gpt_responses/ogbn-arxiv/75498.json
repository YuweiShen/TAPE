This involves computer vision (CV) techniques for image analysis and deep learning (DL) models for facial landmark detection. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also discusses the clinical potential of the proposed algorithm for quantitative assessment of facial function, which involves human-computer interaction (HCI) and user-centered design (UCD) principles. Hence, cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) is another likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of ML models for facial landmark detection, which involves statistical learning theory (SLT) and optimization algorithms. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is another possible sub-category. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of a relatively small number of clinical images for training the ML model, which involves multimedia (MM) and data mining (DM) techniques for handling large datasets. Hence, cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are two more possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
