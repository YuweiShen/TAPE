The use of total variation minimization and Haar wavelet transform also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the focus on non-uniform recovery and breaking sample complexity barriers may also fall under the scope of statistical learning theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
