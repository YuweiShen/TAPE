It also involves Fourier analysis and polynomial approximation, which are topics in theoretical computer science (cs.CC). The construction of explicit functions based on ${\\sf Tribes}$ and ${\\sf CycleRun}$ involves combinatorial structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the statistical query (SQ) framework of Kearns, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper deals with the resilience of Boolean functions, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
