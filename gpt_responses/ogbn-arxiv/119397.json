The focus on practical problems and skipping theoretical introduction suggests that the paper is aimed at beginners. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of neural networks suggests that cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a likely sub-category. The mention of Matlab, Torch, and Tensorflow suggests that the paper may also fall under cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SD (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
