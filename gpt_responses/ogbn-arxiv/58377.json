The paper also mentions Bayesian deep learning (cs.AI), loss surfaces (cs.CV), and effective dimensionality (cs.NE), which are all relevant to the broader field of artificial intelligence. Additionally, the paper discusses the interplay between parameters and functions, which is a topic that falls under the sub-field of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
