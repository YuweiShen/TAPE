The use of polar codes for achieving secrecy is also a key contribution of the paper, which is a popular topic in the information theory community.\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper deals with achieving secrecy in wiretap channels, which is a key problem in cryptography and security. The use of random bits to exhaust the observations of the eavesdropper is also a cryptographic technique.\n3. cs.SI (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with designing a coding scheme for achieving secrecy in a wiretap channel, which can be seen as a control problem. The use of polar codes for achieving secrecy can also be seen as a system design problem.\n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper does not explicitly deal with computational complexity, but the use of polar codes for achieving secrecy can be seen as a computational problem. Polar codes are known for their low complexity encoding and decoding algorithms.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper does not deal with multimedia directly, but the use of polar codes for achieving secrecy can be applied to multimedia communication scenarios, where secure transmission is important."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
