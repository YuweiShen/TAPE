The paper also discusses the importance of addressing this vulnerability in critical applications such as cybersecurity, which falls under the subfield of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper proposes a framework for protecting deep neural models, which involves dimensionality reduction techniques commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper presents empirical results on the effectiveness of the proposed framework, which is a common practice in the subfield of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
