The proposed method leverages the divide-and-conquer philosophy to address the issue of large variance in instance scales, which is a key challenge in object instance detection. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel framework that combines multiple sub-networks to detect pedestrians with different scales, which involves machine learning and optimization techniques. Therefore, the paper may also be relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Robotics (cs.RO), and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
