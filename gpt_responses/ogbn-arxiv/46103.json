This involves combining representation learning and planning, and proposing a framework that maximizes the mutual information between the generated observations and the transition in the planning model. The paper also structures the planning model to be compatible with efficient planning algorithms and proposes several such models based on either discrete or continuous states. Given these topics, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves aspects of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY), which are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
