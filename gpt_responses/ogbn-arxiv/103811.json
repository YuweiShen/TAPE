The proposed method involves using a recurrent neural network (RNN) to calibrate irregular text, which is a technique commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) and speech recognition (cs.CL). The paper also mentions fiducial-point refinement, which involves refining the coordinates of specific points in the image, a technique that is often used in image retrieval and object detection (cs.IR). The paper also involves designing a network architecture, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
