The use of deep neural networks for non-acted body affect recognition suggests that the paper belongs to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) subcategories. The focus on human-robot interaction and behaviour analysis suggests that the paper may also belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) subcategory. The use of 3D skeleton data and the analysis of body movements suggest that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) subcategory. Finally, the potential applications of the proposed method in video surveillance and robotics suggest that the paper may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) subcategory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
