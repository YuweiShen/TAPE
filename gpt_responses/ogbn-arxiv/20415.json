This falls under the intersection of computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the use of limited data and proposes a multi-stage training procedure, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with the design of the neural network architecture, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
