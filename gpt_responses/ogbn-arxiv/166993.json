The paper also formulates the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which falls under the category of systems and control (SY). The use of reward functions and uncertainty reduction suggests a focus on machine learning (LG) and computer vision (CV) techniques. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI, cs.RO, cs.SY, cs.LG, and cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
