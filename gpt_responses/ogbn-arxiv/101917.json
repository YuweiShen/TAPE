The proposed algorithms involve joint detection and decoding, which is a common theme in signal processing (cs.SI) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the complexity of the algorithms, which is a topic related to computer communications (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
