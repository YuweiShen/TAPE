The paper also discusses algorithms and implementation (cs.DS) for solving these games, which can be used in controller synthesis and verification (cs.AI). Finally, the paper extends the concept of parity games to generalized parity games, which involves conjunction or disjunction of parity objectives, which falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
