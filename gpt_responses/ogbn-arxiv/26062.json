The use of cache memories also involves networked communication (cs.NI) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the optimization of cache sizes, which can be seen as a machine learning problem (cs.LG) or a signal processing problem (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
