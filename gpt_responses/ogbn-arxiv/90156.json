The paper specifically focuses on routing security, which is a subfield of network security, and thus could also fall under the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) category. The paper also mentions optimization of routing protocols, which is a subfield of algorithms and data structures, and thus could fall under the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) category. The paper discusses the need for secure routing protocols, which involves software engineering and system design, and thus could fall under the cs.SE (Software Engineering) category.
