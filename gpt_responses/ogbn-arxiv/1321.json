This suggests that the paper may belong to the computational geometry sub-category. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper mentions that graph burning can be used to model the spread of social influence or social contagion, which falls under the scope of social and information networks. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the computational complexity of the graph burning problem and presents NP-completeness results, which is a topic that falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper presents NP-completeness results for graph burning on several sub-classes of geometric graphs, which is a topic that falls under the scope of computational complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
