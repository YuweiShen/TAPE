The proposed technique of decaying momentum is specifically designed for gradient-based optimizers, which is a common technique used in neural network training. Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the application of the proposed technique to computer vision tasks, which falls under cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper is focused on improving the performance of adaptive methods, which is a sub-field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves experimentation and analysis of the performance of different optimization techniques, which could also fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
