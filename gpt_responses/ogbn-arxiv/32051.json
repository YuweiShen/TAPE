The use of a Markov decision process to optimize the joint transmission power control and remote estimation suggests that the paper may also fall under the machine learning (cs.MA) and reinforcement learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the use of a scalar dynamic process and the focus on the transmission power being symmetric and monotonically increasing with respect to the innovation error suggests that the paper may also fall under the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
