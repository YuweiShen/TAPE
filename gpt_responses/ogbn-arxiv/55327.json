This falls under the category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also mentions the use of machine learning models to aggregate the annotations, which suggests a connection to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The use of ontology also implies a connection to Database (cs.DB) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper mentions the use of a semantic map to display the selection of documents, which could be related to Visualization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
