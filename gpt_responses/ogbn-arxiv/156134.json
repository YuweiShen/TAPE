Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces a novel multi-modal ML approach called \"cross-modal learning\", which involves training a correlation tower to guide the main multi-modal video categorization tower. This technique involves learning correlations between different modalities, which could fall under the sub-categories of cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also mentions the use of different types of models, such as RNN and Transformer, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed models through experiments, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
