The proposed method involves geometry and partial derivatives, which are also relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG). The use of statistical body shape models and optimization algorithms suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.MM) and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
