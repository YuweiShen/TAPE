This falls under the domain of information theory, which deals with the transmission, processing, and utilization of information. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): Multi-user MIMO systems are commonly used in wireless networks, and the paper discusses the optimization of transmit antenna selection in such systems. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with the optimization of transmit antenna selection in multi-user MIMO systems, which can be seen as a type of social network where multiple users are connected to a common network. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the optimization of transmit antenna selection in multi-user MIMO systems, which are commonly used for multimedia applications such as video streaming and online gaming. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper derives explicit formulae for the computational complexities of the proposed algorithms, which falls under the domain of computational engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
