The use of CNNs for steganalysis and the adoption of adversarial embedding strategies are related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The game-theoretic framework used to solve the problem is related to multi-agent systems and artificial intelligence (cs.MM, cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
