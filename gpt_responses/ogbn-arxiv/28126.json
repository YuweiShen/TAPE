The use of relative-distance constraints is also relevant to semi-supervised learning, which is a common topic in the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of clustering, which is a topic in natural language processing (cs.CL) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
