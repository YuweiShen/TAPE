This is a common topic in machine learning and falls under the sub-category of cs.LG.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. The proposed method can be applied to a wide variety of settings, including finite state spaces, continuous state spaces, and partially observable tasks where only sensor measurements are available. This makes it relevant to the cs.AI sub-category.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with modeling transition dynamics in Markov decision processes (MDPs), which is a common topic in systems and control. The proposed method can be used to efficiently perform value function estimation in a wide variety of settings, including continuous state spaces, making it relevant to the cs.SY sub-category.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new approach to estimating the value function in reinforcement learning that avoids the need to approximate intractable integrals. The method is based on RKHS embeddings of conditional distributions, which can be computed efficiently using linear complexity in the sample size. This makes it relevant to the cs.DS sub-category.\n5. cs"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
