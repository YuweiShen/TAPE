It also involves the use of tree codes, which are a common tool in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper introduces a new notion of goodness for tree codes, which is related to their ability to emulate interactive communication protocols, and proves the correctness of an explicit emulation procedure based on any \"potent\" tree code. This involves analyzing the properties of the tree code, which is a problem in data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the limitations of previous work on this problem, which involves analyzing the security of protocols, a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper uses probabilistic arguments to show that randomly generated tree codes are potent with high probability, which is a problem in discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
