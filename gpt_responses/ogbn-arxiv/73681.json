The proposed approach is self-supervised and makes use of the kinematic model of the robot, which suggests that it falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The optimization method used to obtain good labels despite an unknown hand-eye calibration and an imprecise kinematic model involves machine learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks, which are also used for pixel-wise classification, indicating that the paper could also belong to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
