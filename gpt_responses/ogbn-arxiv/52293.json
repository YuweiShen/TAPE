The paper proposes a new learning methodology called cross-paced partial curriculum learning (CPPCL), which involves optimizing a non-convex minimization problem, a topic that falls under machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as it deals with the problem of retrieving images based on sketches. Additionally, the paper involves multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with the problem of learning coupled feature representations to describe data from two related sources. Finally, the paper involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it proposes a new learning methodology that is designed to assess the learning pace by jointly handling data from dual sources and modality-specific prior information provided in the form of partial curricula."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
