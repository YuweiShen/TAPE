Therefore, cs.AI and cs.DB are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a formal definition of an ABox module, which is a logical concept, making cs.LO a likely sub-category as well. The paper also discusses the feasibility of isolated or distributed (parallel) ABox reasoning, which falls under the scope of software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper presents an approximation for $\\mathcal{SHIQ}$ ontologies, which is a specific type of description logic, making cs.DL a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
