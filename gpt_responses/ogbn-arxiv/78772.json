This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of logistic regression and convolutional neural networks, which are common machine learning techniques used in classification tasks, indicating the likelihood of the paper belonging to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category.
