Therefore, it is likely to belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the matching statistics of the strings, which falls under the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) sub-category. The paper also presents a theoretical solution for the k=1 case, which involves information theory and coding, making it relevant to the cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-category. Finally, the paper presents a practical solution that uses constant space, which is relevant to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
