The paper also mentions handling imperfections in event delivery, which is a common challenge in distributed systems. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper discusses query language features and consistency requirements, which are important considerations in database systems. The CEDR system also aims to handle temporal data, which is a common feature in database systems. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the development of the CEDR system and outlines next steps in its development, which are topics relevant to software engineering. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the processing model of event processing, data streams, and asynchronous messaging, which are all related to data structures and algorithms. The paper also discusses the temporal stream model used in the CEDR system. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses query language features and the development of a new query language for the CEDR system, which are topics relevant to programming languages."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
