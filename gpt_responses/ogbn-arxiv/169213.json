The use of Monte Carlo tree search is a common technique in game playing and optimization problems, which falls under the category of algorithms and complexity (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of ensembling, which is a common technique in machine learning and data science (cs.LG, cs.DS). The optimization process and warm-start initialization are also important topics in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.SE). Finally, the empirical studies involve comparing the proposed approach with other AutoML tools, which is related to the field of neural networks and learning systems (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
