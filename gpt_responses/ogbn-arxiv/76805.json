Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the use of reinforcement learning algorithms for optimizing handover decisions suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The focus on mobility support and control of drone operations suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
