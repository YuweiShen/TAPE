This is a topic that is relevant to programming languages and their implementation.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new idea for adapting relational abstract domains to the analysis of floating-point numbers. This is a topic that is relevant to software engineering, as it can help improve the reliability and correctness of software.\n- cs.AR (Architecture): The paper discusses the modeling of expressions as linear forms with interval coefficients, which is a topic that is relevant to computer architecture and hardware design.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses fixpoint stabilization techniques, which are used in the analysis of recursive programs and can be seen as a topic related to logic in computer science.\n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper discusses the use of abstract domains to analyze floating-point numbers, which can be seen as a topic related to formal languages and automata theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
