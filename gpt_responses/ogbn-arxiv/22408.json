The paper focuses on the smoothness of the payoff functions, which is a key driver of complexity in this problem. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.ST (Statistics). The paper also leverages the notion of self-similarity, which is a concept from the statistics literature, making cs.IT (Information Theory) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with bandit algorithms, which is a topic commonly studied in the cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
