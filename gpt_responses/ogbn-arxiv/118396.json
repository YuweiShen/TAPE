It also involves the study of trade-offs between quality and robustness of solutions, which is related to optimization (cs.DS) and game theory (cs.GT). The use of metrics and approximation algorithms suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DM) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
