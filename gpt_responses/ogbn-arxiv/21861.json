Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses security issues, which could place it in the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) category. The proposed mathematical model and simulation/experimental work could also place it in the cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) categories.
