This topic is closely related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, which makes cs.LG and cs.AI the most likely categories. The paper also proposes a new approach to $\\varepsilon$ decay based on feedback from the environment, which involves control systems and robotics, making cs.RO a likely category as well. The paper also involves neural networks, which are a common tool in reinforcement learning, making cs.NE a possible category. Finally, the paper deals with the performance of the proposed approach, which involves system analysis and control, making cs.SY a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
