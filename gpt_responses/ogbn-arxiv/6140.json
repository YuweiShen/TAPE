The proposed method is evaluated on real-world autonomous driving and indoor localization datasets, which suggests that it could also fall under robotics (cs.RO). The use of recurrent models and probabilistic pose estimates indicates a focus on deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the evaluation on video datasets suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
