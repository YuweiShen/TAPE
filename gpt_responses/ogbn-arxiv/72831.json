The paper uses statistical theory and intuition to study the Personalized PageRank (PPR) algorithm, which is a popular technique for approximating the PPR vector without querying the entire massive graph. The paper also uses the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel to study whether the PPR vector can select nodes that belong to the same block as the seed node. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SD (Software Engineering), cs.SOC (Computational Social Science), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
