The use of attention masks to eliminate image background is a technique that falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the vulnerability of DNNs to adversarial examples, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a new method for improving robustness, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
