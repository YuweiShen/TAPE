The paper also mentions the use of sigmoid activation functions, which is a common topic in neural network optimization (cs.NE). The successful application of deep neural networks is also mentioned, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of neural networks in computer vision applications, which falls under the computer vision subfield (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the construction of connected sets of local solutions, which is a topic in the subfield of computational topology (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
