Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also proposes architectural amendments to NDN, which involves aspects of computer architecture and design, making cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) a likely category as well. The optimization of throughput and latency involves data processing and transmission, which could fall under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the proposed approach involves the use of algorithms and protocols, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
