The problem is formulated as a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem, which involves modeling deferrable appliance load and applying approximation and decomposition techniques to handle the design problem in a decentralized fashion. The developed decentralized CoHEM algorithm allows customers to locally compute their scheduling solutions using domestic user information and with message exchange between their neighbors only. This paper involves topics related to systems and control (cs.SY), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC), and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
