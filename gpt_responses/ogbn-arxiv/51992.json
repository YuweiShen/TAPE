The use of maximum-ratio-combining and regenerative multi-relay cooperative networks also suggests a focus on signal processing and optimization, which are relevant to the sub-categories of Signal Processing (cs.SP) and Optimization and Control (cs.OC). However, these sub-categories are less likely as they are not explicitly mentioned in the abstract or title."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
