This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for pixel classification and bounding box regression suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper's focus on handwriting recognition and symbol detection may also make it relevant to the sub-category of natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
