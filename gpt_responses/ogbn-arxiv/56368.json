This involves algorithms that exploit sparsity parameters and support incremental operations to both ends of A and a single type of incremental operation in J matrix. This problem involves data structures and algorithms, which are typically studied in the sub-categories of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
