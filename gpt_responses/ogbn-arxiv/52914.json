Therefore, cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely categories. Additionally, since the focus is on image processing, cs.CV (Computer Vision) is also a likely category. The paper also discusses the ability to reconfigure the hardware at runtime, which falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.ET (Embedded Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
