The approach involves using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to incorporate a relational inductive bias, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the generalization of the models to scenarios with novel and an increasing number of objects, which is relevant to the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
