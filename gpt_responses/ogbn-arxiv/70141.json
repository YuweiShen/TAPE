The use of conditional random fields for refinement is also a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper specifically deals with confocal microscopy images, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of deep neural networks for segmentation is a common application of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
