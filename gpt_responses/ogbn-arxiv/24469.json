The use of ARQ is also a common technique in communication systems (cs.COMM) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of convolutional codes, which are commonly used in communication systems (cs.COMM) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of the Rician factor on the decoding performance, which is a topic in wireless communication (cs.MM) and network infrastructure (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
