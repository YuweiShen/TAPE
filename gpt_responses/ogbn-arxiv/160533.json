This aligns with the scope of cs.CY, which focuses on the intersection of computing and societal issues.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper proposes a universal tagging mechanism based on the Pluchik Wheel of Emotion to map emotions of older adults on urban space. This involves analyzing social media data, which falls under the scope of cs.SI.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the usability testing of the proposed platform, which is a key aspect of HCI research. Additionally, the platform aims to address the issue of excluding the voice of older adults, which is a common concern in HCI research.\n- cs.SD (Sound): Although the paper does not explicitly mention sound, the proposed platform could potentially incorporate sound-based data (e.g. audio recordings of urban spaces) to map emotions of older adults. This aligns with the scope of cs.SD, which focuses on sound and music computing.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): While the paper does not directly involve computational complexity, the proposed platform could potentially involve complex algorithms for analyzing social media data and"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
