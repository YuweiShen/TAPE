Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also makes use of Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to reduce computational complexity, which suggests a possible fit with cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also proposes a group partitioning mechanism, which could be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper deals with collaborative editing in cloud storage systems, which could be relevant to cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper deals with privacy and zero knowledge guarantees, which could be relevant to cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
