Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper proposes a novel network structure for semantic segmentation, which involves sharing kernels among different branches. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) as well as multimedia (cs.MM) since semantic segmentation is often used in multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
