Therefore, the most likely category is cs.PL (Programming Languages) which deals with the design, implementation, and analysis of programming languages and their associated tools and methodologies. The paper also involves software engineering (cs.SE) as it presents a new approach to automated verification and bug-finding tools for higher-order programs. The paper also deals with logical aspects of computer science (cs.LO) as it presents a sound and relatively complete approach to reasoning about higher-order programs. The paper also involves formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL) as it deals with symbolic execution and reasoning about flow-sensitive facts. Finally, the paper also involves cryptography and security (cs.CR) as it presents a system for verifying and refuting behavioral software contracts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
