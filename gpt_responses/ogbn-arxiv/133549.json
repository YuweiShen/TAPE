The use of autonomous systems for collision avoidance also involves robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also addresses safety concerns in dense airspace, which is related to computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the use of deep reinforcement learning for optimizing the collision avoidance system involves machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
