This involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms for ANNS. \n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): ANNS is a crucial component in many computer vision applications such as image retrieval and object recognition. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): ANNS is also an important problem in machine learning, particularly in the context of nearest neighbor classifiers. \n5. cs.DB (Databases): ANNS is a common problem in database systems, where efficient indexing and retrieval of high-dimensional data is crucial."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
