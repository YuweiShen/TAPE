The proposed model involves splitting the decode state into two parts and updating them in different time-scales, which involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The model also leverages information in different granularities, which is a common theme in neural networks (cs.NE) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
