The use of vanishing signatures and the focus on symmetric constraint functions suggest that the paper may also fall under cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.GT (Discrete Geometry and Topology). Finally, the mention of holographic transformations and their role in the proof suggest that the paper may also be relevant to cs.SC (Symbolic Computation and Formal Verification)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
