The paper also proposes a deep learning framework that involves the modulation of restoration levels, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The experiments conducted in the paper involve image processing and manipulation, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new layer for deep neural networks, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
