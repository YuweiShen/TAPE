The paper proposes a framework for automatic extraction of domain-specific sentiment words, which involves techniques such as bootstrapping, synonymy graph, and graph propagation algorithm. These techniques are commonly used in NLP and sentiment analysis research, which falls under the scope of cs.CL.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with the task of extracting sentiment words from user comments, which can be seen as a form of information retrieval. The paper proposes a method for generating large-scale patterns for sentiment word extraction, which involves techniques such as syntactic and sequential relations. These techniques are relevant to information retrieval and can be applied to tasks such as query expansion and relevance ranking.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves the use of machine learning techniques such as bootstrapping and graph propagation algorithm for sentiment word extraction. These techniques are commonly used in machine learning research, which falls under the scope of cs.LG.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a framework for automatic extraction of domain-specific sentiment words, which involves techniques such as bootstrapping, synonymy graph, and graph propagation algorithm.
