The paper also discusses user profiling and cross-domain recommendations, which are related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of neural networks for modeling user-item interactions and fine-tuning them for downstream tasks is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) domains, which are also mentioned in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
