It introduces a new notion of capacity for the many-access channel model and characterizes it for the Gaussian many-access channel with random user activities. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper is motivated by emerging systems with a massive number of users in an area, such as machine-to-machine communication systems and sensor networks. The many-access channel model is a common model in networking and communication systems. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with a scenario where there are many transmitters and an unknown subset of them may transmit in a given block and need to be identified. This is a common problem in social and information networks where there are many users and identifying the active ones is important. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The many-access channel model is a common model in multimedia systems, where there are many sources transmitting data to a single receiver. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with a system with many transmitters and a single receiver, and proposes a new notion of capacity for this system. This is a problem that falls under the purview of systems and control theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
