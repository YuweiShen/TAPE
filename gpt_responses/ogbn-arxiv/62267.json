Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the efficiency of NAS, which falls under the category of optimization and search algorithms, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely category. Additionally, the paper proposes a new proxy strategy for NAS, which involves evaluating network candidates under a reduced setting, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a possible category. The paper also mentions evolutionary-based NAS, which falls under the category of neural networks and deep learning, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) another possible category. Finally, the paper discusses the computational aspects of NAS, which could fall under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing, making cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
