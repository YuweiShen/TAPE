The use of linear codes also suggests that the paper may fall under the categories of cryptography (cs.CR) and coding theory (cs.CC). The proposed asymptotic metrics may also be relevant to the study of discrete structures (cs.DS) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
