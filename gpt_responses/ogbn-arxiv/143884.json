The paper also discusses the behavior of the network under different conditions, which falls under the scope of cs.SY. The use of Gaussian fields and large deviations theory suggests a connection to cs.MA, while the investigation of energy efficiency and per-node information relates to cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
