Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-category of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper involves information retrieval (IR) techniques to extract relevant information from scientific papers, which is another relevant sub-category. The use of machine learning models also suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Deep Learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
