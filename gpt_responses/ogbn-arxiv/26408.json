The sequences are also designed to resist attacks, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The interleaving technique used in the construction of the sequences is a common technique in coding theory (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the Rational Approximation Algorithm, which is a common algorithm used in signal processing and control theory (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with the properties of binary sequences, which is a topic related to computer networks and communication (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
