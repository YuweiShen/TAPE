This topic falls under the category of data structures and algorithms, which is covered by several sub-categories in arXiv CS. Specifically, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.AL (Computational Complexity), cs.CC (Computational Geometry), and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) are all potential sub-categories that could cover this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
