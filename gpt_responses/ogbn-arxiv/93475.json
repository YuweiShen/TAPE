The algorithm combines multiple-instance learning (MIL) and deep recurrent neural networks (DRNN) to identify events in multidimensional time series data that are correlated with safety incidents. This work involves developing a scalable tool to perform analysis over a large number of events, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI), security and privacy (cs.CR), social and information networks (cs.SI), and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
