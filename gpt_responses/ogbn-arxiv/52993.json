Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Communications (cs.COMM), and Signal Processing (cs.SY) categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of multi-path channels and vehicular applications, which suggests that it may also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category. Finally, the paper presents numerical examples and simulations, indicating that it may also belong to the Learning (cs.LG) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
