The paper proposes an algebraic geometric analysis on the TT manifold to obtain deterministic and probabilistic conditions on the sampling pattern for finite completability. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Low-rank tensor completion is a problem that arises in many machine learning applications, such as collaborative filtering and recommender systems. The paper proposes a technique to characterize the sampling patterns that ensure finite completability of low tensor train rank tensor. \n3. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes a deterministic and probabilistic analysis of the sampling patterns for low-rank tensor completion. This is a problem that is of interest to the numerical analysis community, as it involves solving large-scale optimization problems. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a technique to characterize the sampling patterns that ensure finite completability of low tensor train rank tensor. This is a problem that is of interest to the data structures and algorithms community, as it involves designing efficient algorithms for low-rank tensor completion. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Low-rank tensor completion is a problem that arises in many social and information network applications, such as link prediction and community detection.
