Information theory is closely related to the design and analysis of communication systems, and the use of LDPC codes and MIMO systems are common in this field. \n2. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The proposed receiver is based on signal processing techniques such as SDR and iterative processing. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of forward error correction (FEC) codes in the detection stage, which is relevant to networking and internet architecture. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The use of MIMO systems is often associated with multimedia applications such as video streaming and wireless communication. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a simplified SDR turbo receiver that reduces the time complexity of the receiver. This is relevant to computational engineering and science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
