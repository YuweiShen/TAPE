This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The use of the differentiation-integration observer for navigation of a quadrotor aircraft can also be considered as a robotics application.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper involves numerical simulations of the proposed observer on a quadrotor aircraft, which can be considered as a computational engineering application.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention the use of machine learning techniques, the proposed observer can be seen as a type of learning algorithm that estimates the derivatives and integrals of a signal based on sensor measurements.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Similar to the reasoning for cs.LG, the proposed observer can be seen as an AI algorithm that estimates the derivatives and integrals of a signal based on sensor measurements."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
