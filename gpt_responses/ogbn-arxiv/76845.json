This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG the most likely category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of deep learning and boosting systems for load forecasting can also be considered as an application of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI a likely category.\n3. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a deep neural network architecture for load forecasting, which involves the use of multiple boosting systems. This falls under the domain of neural computing, making cs.NE a likely category.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although the paper does not explicitly mention social or information networks, the use of sparse interactions and parameter sharing in the proposed architecture can be considered as a form of network modeling, making cs.SI a possible category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with load forecasting in buildings, which involves the control of energy consumption. This falls under the domain of systems and control, making cs.SY a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
