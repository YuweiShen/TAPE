The use of $\\delta-$minimum edge colouring suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper may also be relevant to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) as it proposes tools for edge colouring. Finally, the use of the term \"parcimonious edge-colouring\" suggests that the paper may be relevant to combinatorial optimization (cs.CO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
