This involves using computational tools to locate key past cases that could assist with diagnosis. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the proposed model is designed to yield predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, which suggests that it could also belong to the Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of publicly available healthcare datasets, which suggests that it could belong to the Databases (cs.DB) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of natural language explanations, which suggests that it could also belong to the Computation and Language (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
