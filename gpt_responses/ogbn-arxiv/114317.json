The proposed approach involves exploiting knowledge of channel characteristics, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of beamforming, which is a technique commonly used in wireless communication systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
