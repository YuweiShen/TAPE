The algorithm is designed to form a geometric shape, which involves coordination and communication among the robots, making it relevant to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY). The use of local measurements and the absence of communication between robots suggest the involvement of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The algorithm's computational cost and the use of laser scanners also indicate the possibility of machine vision and image processing (cs.CV) being involved. Finally, the validation of the algorithm's performance with a team of robots suggests the involvement of experimental validation (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
