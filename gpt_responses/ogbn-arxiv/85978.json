The use of sparse superposition codes and spatial coupling also suggests a connection to the compressed sensing (cs.CC) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The mention of simulation results and comparison with LDPC codes suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and networking (cs.NI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
