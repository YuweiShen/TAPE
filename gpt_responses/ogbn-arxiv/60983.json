This involves incorporating relational information into the modeling of multi-object dynamics, which is a common theme in machine learning research. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also deals with stochastic systems, which suggests that it could belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.CV (Computer Vision), depending on the specific application."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
