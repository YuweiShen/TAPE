The development of a new efficient numerical technique for evaluating the growth rate of the weight distribution involves solving a system of polynomial equations, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete structures (cs.DS). The application of the technique to two example code ensembles involves simulations and statistical analysis, which are topics in statistical inference (cs.SI) and network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
