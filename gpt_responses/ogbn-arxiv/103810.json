As such, it is likely to fall under the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category. Additionally, the paper discusses congestion control and routing, which are also relevant to the Computer Networks and Communications (cs.CR) and Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) categories. The use of novel kernel-based transport-layer accelerations may also make this paper relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category. Finally, the paper's discussion of an ideal pipe model of data transmission may make it relevant to the Architecture (cs.AR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
