Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces two annotated facial key-points datasets, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia). The use of deep learning architectures for facial key-point detection and classification suggests that it may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, since the paper deals with the security aspect of identifying disguised faces, it may also belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
