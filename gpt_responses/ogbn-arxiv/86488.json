The data from peripheral sensors and brain-computing interface were collected, integrated, and analyzed by several statistical and machine learning methods. The paper focuses on the application of machine learning methods for characterization of complex human activity patterns, which suggests that it could belong to several sub-categories. \n\ncs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) is the most likely sub-category as the paper deals with the development of a new method to monitor physical load and accumulated fatigue by several objective and subjective characteristics. \n\ncs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely sub-category as the paper applies several statistical and machine learning methods to analyze the collected data. \n\ncs.CY (Computers and Society) is another possible sub-category as the paper deals with the development of a method that could have implications for the well-being of individuals. \n\ncs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a possible sub-category as the paper deals with brain-computing interface (electroencephalography) data. \n\ncs.SI (Social and Information Networks) is another possible sub-category as the paper deals with the development of a method to monitor physical load and accumulated fatigue, which could have implications for social networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
