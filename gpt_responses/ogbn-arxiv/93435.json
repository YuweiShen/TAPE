The paper specifically focuses on policy gradients and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), which are common techniques in machine learning and reinforcement learning, respectively. Therefore, cs.LG (machine learning) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also mentions board games, which are often studied in the context of game theory (cs.GT). Additionally, the paper may involve computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) if the board games involve visual or textual elements."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
