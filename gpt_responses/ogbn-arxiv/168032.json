This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in healthcare. The paper also discusses the use of a novel pre-clinical evaluation method to estimate the accuracy and uncertainty of clinician's decisions versus the system recommendations, which falls under the category of computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) to capture uncertainty in patient state, which falls under the category of cybernetics (cs.CY). Finally, the paper discusses the importance of incorporating human experts in the evaluation process, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
