However, the focus on meta-learning as a way to reduce training overhead and complexity suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses information theory (cs.IT), neural networks (cs.NE), and systems and control (cs.SY), which are all relevant to the topic. Additionally, the use of domain knowledge and prior knowledge suggests that the paper could also belong to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
