Therefore, cs.RO (Robotics) is the most likely sub-category. The proposed method uses texture and geometric shape to detect landing sites, which falls under cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques, which is related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of handling hazards and uncertainties, which is relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
