The paper discusses a novel approach called Controlled Forgetting Networks (CFNs) that uses targeted stimulation and dopaminergic plasticity modulation to control the forgetting process and reduce the degradation of accuracy for older tasks while learning new tasks. This work is related to neural networks, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, which are covered by several arXiv CS sub-categories. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
