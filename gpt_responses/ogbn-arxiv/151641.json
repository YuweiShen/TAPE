This involves analyzing hand gestures, facial expressions, and body poses from multi-channels (RGB, depth, motion, and skeleton joints) to learn the overall temporal dynamics in a video. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also involves analyzing non-manual face movements in some cases, which falls under the sub-category of cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). Additionally, the paper deals with fusing multimodality features, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.MM (Multimedia). \n\nThe paper involves recognizing ASL manual signs, which is a natural language processing task and could fall under the sub-category of cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the paper involves training a 3DCNN model, which is a machine learning technique and could fall under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
