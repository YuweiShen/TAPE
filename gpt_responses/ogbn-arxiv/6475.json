This is a common problem in machine learning, and the paper proposes a method to compute the optimal policy efficiently. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method to solve a sequential decision problem, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence. \n3. cs.ST (Statistics): The paper deals with Bayesian sequential testing of multiple simple hypotheses, which is a statistical problem. \n4. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the curse of dimensionality in state space, which is a common problem in information theory. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper extends the results to the sequential sampling control problem, which is a problem in systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
