It also discusses protection guarantees offered by the compartmentalized abstract machine, which is related to security.\n2. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper discusses the secure compilation of an unsafe language with buffers, procedures, and components to a simple RISC abstract machine. It also provides thorough proofs, many of them machine-checked in Coq, showing that the compiler satisfies the secure compilation criterion.\n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper discusses the protection of software components from each other in a system of mutually distrustful components running with least privilege. It also ensures that dynamically compromised components cannot break the safety properties of the system at the target level any more than equally privileged components without undefined behavior already could in the source language.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the protection guarantees offered by the compartmentalized abstract machine, which is related to systems and control.\n5. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) - The paper provides thorough proofs, many of them machine-checked in Coq, showing that the compiler satisfies the secure compilation criterion.
