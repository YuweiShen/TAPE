The use of discrete harmonic functions and contact systems of pseudosegments suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the areas of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the stretchability of contact systems, which is a topic in graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper mentions potential applications of the approach, which could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
