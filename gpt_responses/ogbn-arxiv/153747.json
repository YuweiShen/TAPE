This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper analyzes the per-user signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) employing a geometrical spatial channel model to define volumes in space of coherent signal around user antennas. This involves the use of information theory concepts to analyze the performance of the system. \n\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper presents experimental results demonstrating high data rates in the downlink and uplink, which are relevant to multimedia applications. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper describes the system architecture consisting of a general-purpose-processor (GPP) based software-defined radio (SDR) wireless platform implementing a real-time LTE protocol stack to communicate with off-the-shelf LTE devices. This involves the use of systems and control concepts to design and implement the system. \n\n5. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) - The paper describes the system architecture consisting of a general-purpose-processor (GPP) based software-defined radio (SDR) wireless platform. This involves the use of hardware architecture concepts to design and implement the system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
