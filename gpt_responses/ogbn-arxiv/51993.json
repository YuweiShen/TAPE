This involves the study of polytopes and their extended formulations, which are topics in computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also applies the results to obtain polynomial upper bounds on non-negative rank, which is a topic in linear algebra and graph theory (cs.DS, cs.GT). Finally, the paper involves the construction of a compiler to convert algorithms into polytopes, which is a topic in programming languages and compilers (cs.PL) and machine learning (cs.LG). However, since the focus of the paper is on computational complexity and discrete mathematics, cs.CC and cs.DM are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
