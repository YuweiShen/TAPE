The paper also proposes new methods for detecting adversarial examples, which involves regularization and feature extraction, which are common techniques used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper addresses the security aspect of neural networks, which is related to computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a combination of the proposed methods to improve detection results, which involves optimization techniques, which are commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
