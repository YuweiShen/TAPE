The paper also discusses the differences between HLTA and LDA-based methods, which are commonly used in topic modeling. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning) because it proposes a new learning method for latent tree models. The paper discusses the use of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation and proposes a new method inspired by recent advances in the moments method to speed up HLTA. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval) because topic detection is a common task in information retrieval. The paper discusses the use of HLTA for topic detection and compares it to LDA-based methods. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) because topic detection is a common task in natural language processing, which is a subfield of AI. The paper proposes a new method for topic detection that improves upon existing methods. \n\nFinally, the paper may belong to the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) because topic detection is a common task in analyzing social networks and other types of information networks.
