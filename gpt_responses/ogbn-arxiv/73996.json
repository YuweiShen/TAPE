This involves designing and implementing algorithms for UAV control and localization, which falls under the scope of robotics. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with localizing radio signals, which involves measuring signal strength and using it to update a probability distribution over possible transmitter locations. This requires knowledge of wireless networking and signal processing, which are relevant to the sub-category of networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents a system that uses a controller to direct the UAV's search for RF sources. This involves designing and implementing control algorithms, which falls under the scope of systems and control. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions the use of a cell phone making a voice call over LTE as one of the transmitters used to test the system. This involves dealing with security and privacy issues related to cellular communication, which are relevant to the sub-category of cryptography and security. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper mentions the use of an information-theoretic controller to direct the UAV's search for RF sources. This involves using concepts from information theory to optimize the search strategy, which falls under the scope of the"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
