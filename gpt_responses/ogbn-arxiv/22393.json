Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also mentions end-to-end training, which suggests the use of deep learning techniques, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely categories as well. The paper also deals with image processing, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
