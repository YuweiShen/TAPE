The paper proposes a CNN cascaded architecture specifically designed for learning part relationships and spatial context, which involves training the network to detect and regress part heatmaps. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
