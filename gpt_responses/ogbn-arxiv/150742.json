This falls under the domain of game theory, making cs.GT the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper proposes logical systems to analyze strategic coalitions in stochastic games. This falls under the domain of logic in computer science, making cs.LO a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes logical systems to analyze strategic coalitions in stochastic games, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence. This makes cs.AI a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper deals with strategic coalitions in stochastic games, which is a topic of interest in multi-agent systems. This makes cs.MA a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with stochastic games, which is a topic of interest in systems and control.
