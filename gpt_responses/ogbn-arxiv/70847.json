Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also uses distributed representations of words, which falls under the sub-category cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Additionally, the paper deals with text normalization, which is a common task in information retrieval (IR), making cs.IR a likely sub-category. The paper also uses unsupervised learning techniques, which falls under the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper deals with multilingual text, which falls under the sub-category cs.CY (Computational Linguistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
