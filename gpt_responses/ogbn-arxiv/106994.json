The paper focuses on computer vision tasks and proposes a new recurrent network for feature aggregation. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves machine learning techniques, such as learning to aggregate predictions from models of different complexities, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper mentions popular datasets for video classification, which could indicate that it belongs to cs.MM (Multimedia). The proposed framework involves designing a new recurrent network, which could also suggest that it belongs to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
