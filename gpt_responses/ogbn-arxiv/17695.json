This involves pre-learning the spatial and directional distribution of radiant flux from cloud exemplars and using a deep neural network to predict the radiance function for each shading configuration. This work involves computer graphics (cs.GR) and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques, as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational geometry (cs.CG) methods. Additionally, the paper focuses on the design and implementation of the neural network, which involves graph-based representations and hierarchical descriptors, making it relevant to the computer graphics (cs.GRAPHICS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
