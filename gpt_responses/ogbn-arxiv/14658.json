This is a classic problem in information theory, and hence cs.IT is the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a relay system, which is a key component of wireless networks. Hence, cs.NI is also a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a joint design of linear forwarding matrix and equalizer to minimize the total mean-square-error (MSE) of the output signal at the destination. This is a classic problem in control theory, and hence cs.SY is also a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with MIMO-OFDM systems, which are commonly used in multimedia applications. Hence, cs.MM is also a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.COM (Computational Complexity): The paper proposes an optimal design for both correlated and uncorrelated channel estimation errors. This involves solving a complex optimization problem, and hence cs.COM is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
