This involves creating blocks of potentially connected author IDs and using a machine learning model to predict which IDs belong to the same developer. This work involves aspects of software engineering (cs.SE), information retrieval (cs.IR), and database systems (cs.DB) in terms of handling large datasets and resolving identity issues. Additionally, the use of machine learning models for prediction falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
