The paper also mentions the use of different programming languages, which suggests that it could also be relevant to programming languages (cs.PL). The use of abstract syntax trees for comparison suggests that machine learning (cs.LG) could also be relevant. The paper also mentions the difficulty in comparing detection tools, which could be relevant to cryptography and security (cs.CR) and software development (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
