The use of program transformation algorithms is also a key aspect of the paper, which suggests that it could also be relevant to Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Software Engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of induction-iteration methods, which are commonly used in Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL). Finally, the paper presents experimental results, which could be of interest to the Learning (cs.LG) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
