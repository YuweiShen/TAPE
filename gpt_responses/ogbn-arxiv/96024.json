The paper also discusses stability analysis and Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) treatment, which are important topics in control theory and systems (cs.SY). The use of Riemannian Motion Policies (RMPs) and RMPflow also involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper validates the proposed framework through numerical simulation and robotic implementation, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
