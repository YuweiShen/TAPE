Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper discusses congestion control and optimization, which could also fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions the use of queuing structures, which could be related to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
