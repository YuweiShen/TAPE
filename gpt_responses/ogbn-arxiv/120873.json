The problem of identity testing for multidimensional histogram distributions is investigated, which suggests that the paper could belong to categories such as cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.ST (Statistics). The paper presents a computationally efficient algorithm for hypothesis testing with sample complexity, which further supports the possibility of it belonging to these categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
