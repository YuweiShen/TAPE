The proposed framework is based on fuzzy clustering, which is a technique commonly used in data mining and pattern recognition (cs.DM). The framework is also evaluated on 49 benchmarks, which are likely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
