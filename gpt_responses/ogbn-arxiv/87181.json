The paper also discusses the use of recommender systems (cs.IR) and cooperative game theory (cs.GT) to determine fair compensation for users. Additionally, the paper touches on clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques (cs.SI) and partial information (cs.CE) to derive faster alternatives for determining the Shapley value."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
