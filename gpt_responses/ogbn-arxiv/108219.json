The paper also presents a program analysis framework that synthesizes coordination code, which falls under programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE). The use of case studies in Twitter Storm and Bloom also suggests a focus on systems (cs.SY) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
