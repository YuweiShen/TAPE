Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves signal design and cooperative jamming, which are related to networked systems and security, respectively, making cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) likely categories as well. The paper also mentions noise removal and signal separation, which are related to signal processing, making cs.SI (Signal Processing) a possible category. Finally, the paper involves estimation approaches, which are related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.MM (Multimedia) a less likely but still possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
