This falls under the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Robotics (cs.RO), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA). The paper proposes a new RL algorithm called Floyd-Warshall RL (FWRL), which is a modification of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm used in graph theory. This algorithm is designed to improve upon the limitations of model-free RL in multi-goal domains. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.RO, followed by cs.SY and cs.MA."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
