The algorithm combines random coordinate descent algorithms with specialized quasi-martingale convergence analysis. The paper also discusses related work in theoretical computer science and computer vision. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
