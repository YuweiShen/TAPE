The concept of total $L_1$ influence is a fundamental measure of the complexity of Boolean functions, and is studied in various subfields of computer science, including computational complexity (cs.CC), information theory (cs.IT), data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), and computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper's focus on the polynomial upper bound of the total $L_1$ influence suggests that it is most likely to belong to cs.CC or cs.IT, but its application to graph theory and the connection to quantum query complexity also make cs.DS and cs.DM plausible categories. Finally, the paper's use of analytic techniques may also make it relevant to cs.CG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
