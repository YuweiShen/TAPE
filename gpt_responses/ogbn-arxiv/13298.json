Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the use of low-power analog processing and sparsity promoting training scheme, which are relevant to cs.ET (Emerging Technologies). The use of machine learning algorithms and digital coefficients storage suggests relevance to cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves the decoding of time of movement from asynchronous neural spikes, which is related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper presents a chip implementation, which is relevant to cs.EMBD (Embedded Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
