The paper also discusses the optimization and risk bounds of the proposed method, indicating a focus on theoretical analysis. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also mentions the issue of evolving distribution in deep learning, suggesting a possible connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper uses empirical studies on benchmark datasets, indicating a possible connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
