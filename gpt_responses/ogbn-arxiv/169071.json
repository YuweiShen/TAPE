This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG the most likely category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Reinforcement learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, and the paper presents a novel approach to exploration in reinforcement learning environments. Therefore, cs.AI is also a likely category.\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions using raw sensory data in reinforcement learning, which is often associated with computer vision. Additionally, the Deep Maze engine used in the experiments involves visual inputs. Hence, cs.CV is a possible category.\n4. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper extensively uses neural networks for generative modeling and value optimization in reinforcement learning. Therefore, cs.NE is another possible category.\n5. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper uses games as a benchmark for reinforcement learning algorithms and presents a novel maze engine for testing. This falls under the domain of game theory, making cs.GT a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
