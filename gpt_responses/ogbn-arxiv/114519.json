This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper specifically addresses the issue of rapidly evolving threat signatures within the screening requirements and proposes a solution to adapt to new and emerging threat signatures. This falls under the domain of cryptography and security.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel adaptive machine learning methodology for automatic threat recognition, which involves a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier. This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an adaptive automatic threat recognition (AATR) approach, which involves the use of machine learning algorithms to adapt to varying types of materials, required probability of detection, and scales of the threat object. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.\n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves the use of image segmentation algorithms and machine learning classifiers to recognize threat objects within 3D CT images.
