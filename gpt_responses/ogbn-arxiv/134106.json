The paper also discusses methods for constructing test collections, which involves statistical sampling and active selection of documents, indicating a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper proposes a new method that places a distribution over systems, which can be seen as a form of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the human labor involved in constructing test collections, which suggests a connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
