This topic is closely related to computer networks (cs.NI), distributed computing (cs.DC), control systems (cs.SY), information theory (cs.IT), and machine learning (cs.LG) as the authors propose a distributed framework that leverages the unique structure of the problem and parallel processing at fog nodes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
