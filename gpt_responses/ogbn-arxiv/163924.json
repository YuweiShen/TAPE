The use of wax figure faces as a novel and super-realistic 3D face presentation attack also involves the use of materials and fabrication techniques, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) or human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also discusses the potential security risks of face spoofing, which could be relevant to computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper uses a multi-feature voting scheme for detection, which could involve machine learning (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
