The study compares programmers experienced with procedural programming languages and either experienced or not experienced in object-oriented design strategies, indicating a focus on programming languages (cs.PL) and object-oriented design (cs.OO). The paper also discusses the integration of actions and objects in the design process, which is relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the study uses empirical data to analyze the use of different knowledge and schemas, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
