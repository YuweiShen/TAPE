The use of optimization oracles is a common technique in these fields, and the paper provides new insights into the computational power of such oracles. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely categories. The paper also discusses the implications of its results for repeated zero-sum games, which falls under the category of cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). The paper also involves the analysis of algorithms and lower bounds, which are topics in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
