This topic falls under the area of algorithms and complexity theory, specifically in the subfield of parameterized complexity. The paper also mentions specific problems such as Feedback Arc Set in Tournaments and Betweenness in Tournaments, which are related to graph theory and game theory. Therefore, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are: \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity)\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)\n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
