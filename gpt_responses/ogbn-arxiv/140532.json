This involves analyzing large amounts of data stored in a database, which suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.DB (Databases) sub-category. The use of Artificial Neural Network and Machine learning algorithm to reason and detect fraudulent activities suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. The focus on designing an effective fraud detection and deterring architecture suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.SE (Software Engineering) sub-category.
