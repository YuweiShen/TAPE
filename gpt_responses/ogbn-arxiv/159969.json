The use of activation atlases to visualize learned features suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) tasks. The emphasis on transferability of learned features suggests a focus on general machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) tasks. Finally, the use of wide networks and their impact on information capacity suggests a focus on neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
