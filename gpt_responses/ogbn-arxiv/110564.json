The paper proposes a coding scheme to achieve small Age of Information (AoI) at both users, which is a common metric used in information theory to measure information freshness. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with a two-user broadcast channel with feedback, which is a common scenario in networking and internet architecture. The proposed coding scheme aims to improve the AoI at both users, which is a key performance metric in networking. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes an adaptive coding scheme to achieve small AoI at both users, which can be seen as a control problem. The paper analyzes the AoI at both users and compares the proposed scheme with a baseline greedy scheme, which is a common approach in systems and control. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a novel coding scheme to judiciously combine symbols from different updates together, which can be seen as a machine learning problem. The proposed scheme aims to improve the AoI at both users, which is a common objective in machine learning. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with a symbol erasure channel, which is a common scenario in multimedia communication."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
