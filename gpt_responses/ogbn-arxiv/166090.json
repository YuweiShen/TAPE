The paper also proposes a framework for architectural design space exploration, which involves modeling the hardware design task as a multi-dimensional optimization problem, which could fall under the categories of computer architecture (cs.AR) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the need for efficient hardware design, which could fall under the category of embedded systems (cs.ET). Finally, the paper discusses the compatibility of new DNN models with underlying hardware accelerators, which could fall under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
