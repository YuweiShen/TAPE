This involves the use of information theory, networking, and signal processing concepts, which are typically covered in the sub-categories of cs.IT, cs.NI, and cs.SY. The paper also uses tools of stochastic geometry, which falls under the sub-category of cs.MA. Finally, the paper deals with the effective spatial throughput, which is related to the performance of the MIMO system, and hence can be classified under cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
