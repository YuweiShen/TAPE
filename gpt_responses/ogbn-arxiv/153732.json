This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses a library that automates this approach, which could fall under the Programming Languages (cs.PL) or Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-categories. The paper also mentions execution efficiency, which could suggest a focus on Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
