The paper leverages the inherent sporadic traffic of mMTC and considers devices in the uplink massive random access adopt pseudo random pilots, which are designed under the framework of CS theory. The paper also formulates the massive random access at the base stations (BS) as the sparse signal recovery problem by leveraging the sparse nature of active devices. Moreover, the paper develops a distributed multiple measurement vector approximate message passing (DMMV-AMP) algorithm for further improved performance by exploiting the structured sparsity among different receiver antennas and subcarriers. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
