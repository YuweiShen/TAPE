The proposed method involves enhancing the discriminative power of the learned features, which is a key aspect of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the limitations of current methods in dealing with variations in facial appearance, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
