The paper uses machine learning techniques to train a semantic parser in English and test it on other languages. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which is specifically focused on NLP. \n\nThe paper also uses cross-lingual word embeddings, which are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) technique. Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also a likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of universal dependencies, which are a type of machine learning algorithm used in natural language processing. Therefore, cs.LG (Learning) is another likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also uses machine learning techniques to improve performance, which falls under the category of neural networks (NE). Therefore, cs.NE is another likely sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper uses the Parallel Meaning Bank, which is a dataset of semantic graphs. Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is another possible sub-category, as it deals with image and graph analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
