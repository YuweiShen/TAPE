The use of modern machine learning methods such as deep learning also suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the focus on multi-task informal Persian language understanding suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of parsing tree and sentiment polarity annotations suggests that it could belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the use of a large-scale dataset suggests that it could belong to cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
