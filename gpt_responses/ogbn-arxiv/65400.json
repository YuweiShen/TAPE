The use of graph-based codes and optimization techniques also suggests a possible fit in the Data Structures (cs.DS) and Embedded Systems (cs.ET) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of circulant-based structures, which could relate to the sub-category of Architecture (cs.AR). Finally, the focus on practical applications and simulation results could suggest a fit in the Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
