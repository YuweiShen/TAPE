This makes it likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the optimization method used to efficiently solve the SDP problems, which could fall under the sub-categories of information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on classification problems, which could be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
