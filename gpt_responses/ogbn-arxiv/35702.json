Additionally, the paper mentions the use of local differential privacy (LDP) to provide privacy guarantees, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the use of algorithms to optimize the model, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of reported noisy gradients suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the use of a central aggregator to update the model, which suggests that it may fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
