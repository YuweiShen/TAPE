This is a topic related to software engineering. \n\n3. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses the syntax of C++ templates and how it can be simplified using partial evaluation. This is a topic related to logic in computer science. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the two-level nature of C++ and how template instantiation resembles an offline partial evaluator.
