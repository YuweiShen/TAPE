The use of denoising algorithms also involves optimization techniques (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the application of vector extrapolation, which is a technique commonly used in information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
