It proposes a network-based framework to examine computational swarm-based systems via the optics of social dynamics. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.MA (Multiagent Systems). Other likely categories include cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
