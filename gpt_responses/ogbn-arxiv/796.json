The use of penalty terms such as $l_2$ and $l_1$ also suggests a focus on optimization and information theory (cs.IT). The mention of deep nets and big-data approaches points towards the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the discussion of risk curves and statistical physics approach to learning suggests a possible connection to the statistics (cs.ST) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
