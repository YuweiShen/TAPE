The approach of looking for solutions with constant support size involves combinatorial optimization techniques, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and theoretical computer science (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the limitations of achieving smaller values of epsilon, which involves analyzing the complexity of the problem, a common theme in computational complexity theory (cs.CC) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
