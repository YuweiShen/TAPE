The use of inter-robot measurements and limited on-board resources suggests a focus on multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and control systems (cs.SY). The proposed algorithm involves recursive estimation and correction, which is a common theme in estimation theory and control systems, and thus could also be classified under numerical analysis (cs.NI). Finally, the use of formal guarantees and robustness analysis suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
