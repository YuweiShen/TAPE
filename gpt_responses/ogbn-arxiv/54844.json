The use of models with semantic embeddings also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). The problem of concept drift is a common issue in stream learning, which could place the paper in the sub-category of stream learning (cs.SI). The use of ontologies and semantic interpretation of data could also suggest a connection to information retrieval (cs.IR) and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
