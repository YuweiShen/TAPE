The paper also discusses the role of learning and classification strategies, which could be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper includes a psychophysical study involving human observers, which could be relevant to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category.
