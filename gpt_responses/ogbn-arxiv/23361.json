The use of a function to bound the $x$-coordinates of vertices suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The algorithmic aspect of the paper and the mention of tractability suggest a connection to graph theory (cs.GT) and computational complexity (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
