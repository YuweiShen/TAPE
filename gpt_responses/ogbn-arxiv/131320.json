The paper proposes fast algorithms for the (inverse) NFT, which is a key requirement for the simulation and real-time implementation of fiber-optic communication systems based on NFTs. This makes cs.IT a likely sub-category for this paper. \n2. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes fast algorithms for the (inverse) NFT, which involves numerical computations. This makes cs.NA a likely sub-category for this paper. \n3. cs.SI (Systems and Control): The paper deals with transceiver concepts that utilize the NFT and its inverse to (de-)modulate data. This makes cs.SI a likely sub-category for this paper. \n4. cs.SP (Signal Processing): The paper deals with the NSE, which is a well-known model for fiber-optic communication channels. The paper proposes fast algorithms for the (inverse) NFT, which is a key requirement for the simulation and real-time implementation of fiber-optic communication systems based on NFTs.
