The use of Bayesian neural networks and uncertainty quantification also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NEURON). Finally, the application of the method to tumour volume estimation in a medical context suggests a potential fit for the medical informatics (cs.MED) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
