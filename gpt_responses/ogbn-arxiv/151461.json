The paper also discusses the use of ranking functions and unsupervised rank fusion, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions multi-modal information retrieval (MMR), which falls under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses the use of subimage-level pixel-wise LoC maps, which is a technique used in multi-modal image analysis (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
