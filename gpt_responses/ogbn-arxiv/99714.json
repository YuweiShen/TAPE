This involves generating saliency maps and analyzing how agents evolve during the learning phase. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (artificial intelligence), cs.CV (computer vision), and cs.LG (machine learning). Additionally, the paper also tests its method on non-expert human subjects, indicating a potential focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the use of deep RL suggests a possible connection to neural networks and computational neuroscience (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
