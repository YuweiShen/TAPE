The proposed method involves spectral clustering, which is a technique commonly used in unsupervised learning and clustering (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of self-adaption manners, which could fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) or optimization (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
