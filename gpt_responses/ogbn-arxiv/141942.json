The paper proposes methods for accurate covariance matrix estimation, which is a fundamental problem in signal processing and communication theory. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). \n\nThe paper also deals with the practical implementation of the proposed methods, which involves the use of pilot sequences and the exploitation of common structure of the covariance matrices. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). \n\nMoreover, the paper focuses on the performance of massive MIMO systems, which is a topic related to cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper proposes methods based on statistical estimation theory, which is a topic related to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
