The paper specifically focuses on image classification models, which suggests that it could also be classified under computer vision (cs.CV). The use of machine learning models also falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper presents a framework for detecting and mitigating backdoor attacks, which could also be relevant to software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper uses state-of-the-art poisoned models for evaluation, which suggests that it could also be classified under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
