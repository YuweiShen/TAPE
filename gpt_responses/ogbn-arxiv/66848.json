It also involves training of neural networks for segmentation which falls under machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with medical imaging (cs.MED) and uses neural networks for segmentation which is a common technique in neuroscience (cs.NEURON)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
