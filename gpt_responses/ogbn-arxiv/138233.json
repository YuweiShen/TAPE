This falls under the domain of computer vision, making cs.CV the most likely sub-category. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of deep learning techniques such as Mask R-CNN and PAN for text detection can be considered as an application of artificial intelligence. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves the use of deep learning techniques for text detection, which falls under the domain of machine learning. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): Text detection can be considered as a sub-domain of information retrieval, as it involves extracting relevant information from images. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with text detection, which is related to natural language processing. Hence, cs.CL can also be considered as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
