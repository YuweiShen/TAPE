The paper presents algorithms for both the independence oracle and rank oracle settings, which are common in matroid theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), followed by cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
