This topic falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a new network architecture that uses multi-scale cross modules and cascaded supervision, which involves training a sequence of subnetworks in a coarse-to-fine manner. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
