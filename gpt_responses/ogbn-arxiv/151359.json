The use of algorithms and computational methods to test and construct causal graphs suggests a connection to computer science theory (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the application of these methods to identify causal effects in the presence of latent confounding may also be relevant to social and information sciences (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
