The impact and potential of the approach is studied on benchmark datasets related to cancer detection in histopathology slides and facial landmark localization. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). However, the paper also involves the use of group theory and differential structure of Lie groups, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of B-splines for convolutional operations suggests that it could also belong to cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and the study of equivariance under geometric transformations suggests that it could also belong to cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
