The use of a swarm of robots and the coordination among them suggest the involvement of multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and control systems (cs.SY). The exploration and mapping of the environment require the use of artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI), and the wall-climbing units may involve computer vision (cs.CV) for navigation and obstacle avoidance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
