Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves the optimization of QoS metrics, which is related to information theory, making cs.IT (Information Theory) another likely sub-category. The paper also proposes an efficient algorithm, which falls under the category of algorithms and data structures, making cs.SI (Systems and Control) a possible sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the characteristics of mmWave communication, which is related to signal processing and communication technologies, making cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the extension of the algorithms for multi-RF-chain mmBSs and integrated backhaul and access networks, which is related to mobile and wireless computing, making cs.MM (Multimedia) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
