It also involves nonparametric regression and density estimation methods, which are commonly used in machine learning. Additionally, the paper may also fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Robotics (cs.RO) categories as it addresses the issue of interaction-driven robot learning and proposes a new policy gradient algorithm. The paper may also be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category as it deals with control of an RL agent, and the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category as it involves the use of neural networks in RL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
