The most likely sub-category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which is focused on search engines and ranking algorithms. The second most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper proposes a novel method for training unbiased models. The third sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), as the paper deals with natural language queries and documents. The fourth sub-category is cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), as the paper applies the method to eCommerce search data.
