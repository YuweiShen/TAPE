This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of probabilistic methods and variational Bayes, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). In addition, the paper deals with large-scale data, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
