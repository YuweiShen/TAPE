Therefore, cs.CV and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also introduces regularizers to ensure coherence in space and time, which is related to artificial intelligence (AI) and information retrieval (IR). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on several public video action recognition datasets, which is related to multimedia (MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
