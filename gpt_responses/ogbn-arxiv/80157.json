The proposed method uses volumetric feature transformation and normal refinement, which are related to multimedia (MM) and machine learning (LG) subfields. Additionally, the paper introduces a new dataset for 3D human models, which is relevant to artificial intelligence (AI) research. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.GR, followed by cs.MM, cs.LG, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
