The main focus is on the optimization of ARQ allocation with a per-hop delay or end-to-end delay constraint. This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of large deviation techniques to analyze the tail probability of random delay, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper deals with the optimization of link performance, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
