The paper proposes a new framework called Local Perturb-and-MAP (locPMAP) that replaces global optimization with local optimization. This work is likely to be submitted to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category, as it deals with learning and inference challenges. Additionally, the paper focuses on computer vision tasks, which makes it relevant to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) category. The paper also deals with artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational linguistics (cs.CL) tasks, which makes these categories relevant. Finally, the paper deals with cryptography (cs.CR) in the context of perturbation-based models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
