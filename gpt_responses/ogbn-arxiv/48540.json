The proposed method utilizes a pair of images to deblur without estimating blur kernels, which is a popular approach in the field of computer vision. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves statistical modeling and optimization techniques, which are relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves analyzing optical flow, which is relevant to cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
