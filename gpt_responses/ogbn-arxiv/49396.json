It discusses the design of a new system that generates a query based on input candidates and retrieves and ranks results based on the query as well as the input candidates. This falls under the scope of information retrieval. \n\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - The paper discusses the use of natural language input (examples of suitable candidates) to generate a search query. This involves natural language processing techniques, which falls under the scope of computation and language. \n\n3. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses the challenges of talent search and how the new system aims to overcome them. This involves the intersection of technology and society, which falls under the scope of computers and society. \n\n4. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - The paper discusses how the new system allows searchers to interact with the query and dynamically adjust it based on their needs. This involves the design of user interfaces and the study of how humans interact with computers, which falls under the scope of human-computer interaction. \n\n5. cs.DB (Databases) - The paper discusses how the new system retrieves and ranks results based on the query and input candidates. This involves the use of databases to store and retrieve information, which falls under"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
