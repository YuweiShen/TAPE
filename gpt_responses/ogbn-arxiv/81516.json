The paper proposes embodied and situated agent models based on distributed adaptive control theory to predict actions of other agents in different game theoretic tasks. The paper also discusses the limitations of deep learning approaches to address this problem. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
