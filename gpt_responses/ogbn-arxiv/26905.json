This involves analyzing inter-class and inter-person EEG signal characteristics and using an Autoencoder layer to refine the raw EEG signals. The approach is evaluated on both public and local EEG datasets, and the effect of several factors on the recognition results is explored. Given the focus on machine learning techniques and signal processing, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). However, the paper also has applications in human-computer interaction (cs.HC), neuroscience (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
