The paper also discusses learning algorithmic procedures and making analogies between problems, which are topics commonly studied in the sub-fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The experiments involve solving arithmetic problems, which could fall under the sub-categories of natural language processing (cs.CL) or computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the use of neural networks, which is a common tool in the sub-field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
