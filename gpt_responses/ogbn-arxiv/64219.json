Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves network infrastructure and protocols, which suggests the category cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper discusses the performance overhead of the proposed solution, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Finally, the paper addresses privacy concerns, which could also fall under cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
