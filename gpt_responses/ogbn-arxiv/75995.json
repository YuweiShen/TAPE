The use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The problem of detecting photographic defects could also be considered as an artificial intelligence (cs.AI) problem. Finally, the use of user annotations and evaluation of algorithms suggests that it could belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
