This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses diversity gain and constellation design, which are topics in signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a new scheme for interference alignment, which is a topic in communication (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
