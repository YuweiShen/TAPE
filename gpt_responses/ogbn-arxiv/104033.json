Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also uses machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SD (Software Engineering). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of features and embeddings, which could place it in cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the topic of information cascades and their impact on social success and disaster could also make this paper relevant to cs.SOC (Computational Social Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
