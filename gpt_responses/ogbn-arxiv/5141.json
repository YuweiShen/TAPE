Information theory concepts such as MDS coding are used to design the delivery scheme. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper focuses on a Fog RAN system, which is a type of wireless network architecture. The delivery scheme proposed in the paper involves blind interference avoidance on the wireless edge channel, which is a networking concept. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with the design of a content delivery system in a Fog RAN system, which can be viewed as a control system. The paper proposes a delivery scheme that combines caching and interference avoidance to achieve a certain performance metric. \n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper deals with a distributed system (Fog RAN) and proposes a delivery scheme that involves caching at the edge nodes. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with content delivery, which is a multimedia application. The paper proposes a delivery scheme that takes into account the content popularity and the network topology to minimize the delivery time."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
