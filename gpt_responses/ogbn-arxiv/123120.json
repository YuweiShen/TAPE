The paper proposes a new algorithm for matrix completion that has polynomial running time and sample complexity in the rank of the unknown target matrix, linear in the dimension of the matrix, and logarithmic in the condition number of the matrix. This suggests that the paper is likely to be classified under the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the theory, algorithms, and applications of machine learning. The paper proposes a new algorithm for matrix completion, which is a problem in machine learning, and provides theoretical guarantees under standard assumptions.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category deals with the study of information processing, communication, and coding. The paper may be relevant to this sub-category because it deals with the problem of completing a matrix from partial observations, which can be seen as a problem of information recovery.\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): This sub-category deals with the development and analysis of numerical algorithms for solving mathematical problems. The paper proposes a new algorithm for matrix completion that has polynomial running time and sample complexity, which suggests that it may be relevant to this sub-category.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category deals with the design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms and data structures.
