The paper proposes a new method for selecting informative samples during the training of Generative Adversarial Networks. This method involves dynamically estimating sample importance and using a multi-stage sample training scheme. Given that the paper focuses on image-to-image translation, it is most likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. However, since the paper also involves deep learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), graphics (cs.GR), and multimedia (cs.MM), these sub-categories are also likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
