The paper proposes a new algorithm for phase retrieval from quantized measurements, which is relevant to the fields of information theory (cs.IT), computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), scientific computing (cs.SI), and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper discusses the use of a quadratic cost function, which is commonly used in optimization problems in these fields. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of sparsity constraints, which is a common technique in machine learning and signal processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
