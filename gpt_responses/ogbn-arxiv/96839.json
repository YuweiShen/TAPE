It also touches on energy efficiency, which is relevant to embedded systems (cs.ET) and architecture (cs.AR). The comparison between spiking and non-spiking systems involves computational efficiency, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
