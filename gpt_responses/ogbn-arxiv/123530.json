The paper specifically studies the problem from a perspective of controlling the strictness in training the teacher network. The experiments are performed on standard image classification tasks, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
