This falls under the scope of database research.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed approach involves using machine learning techniques to identify erroneous data and suggest patches. This falls under the scope of AI research.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the need for collaboration among data publishers and consumers to maintain the quality of Linked Data. This falls under the scope of research on social and information networks.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the challenges of identifying erroneous data and tracking their origins in dynamically connected datasets. This falls under the scope of research on information retrieval.\n- cs.SOC (Social Computing): The paper proposes a collaborative game to patch statements in DBpedia data, which involves social computing aspects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
