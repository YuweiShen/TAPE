The proposed framework for adversarial CAPTCHA generation is based on state-of-the-art adversarial image generation techniques, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI, cs.LG). Finally, the paper also evaluates the usability of the generated adversarial CAPTCHAs, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
