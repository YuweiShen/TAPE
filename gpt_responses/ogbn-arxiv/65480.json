It may also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category as biometric recognition is often used for security purposes. Machine learning (cs.LG) is another likely sub-category as the paper mentions the development of state-of-the-art algorithms. Multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) are less likely but still possible sub-categories as the paper deals with image data and recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
