The proposed approach involves using brain and physiological signals to continuously assess mental workload, which falls under the category of neural engineering (cs.NE). The use of physiological signals also relates to cybersecurity (cs.CYBER) as it can potentially be used for biometric authentication. The paper also discusses the use of an input device known as the CubTile, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper proposes a new evaluation tool for 3D user interfaces, which could be considered a form of system evaluation (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
