The paper also discusses the importance of advance knowledge of reliable neighbors, which is a topic in network information theory (cs.NI). The problems studied, maximal independent set and connected dominating set, are classic problems in graph theory and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the properties of unreliable networks that enable efficient local computation, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT) and social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
