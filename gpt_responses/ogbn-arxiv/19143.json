The use of uncertainty estimates is a recent development in the machine learning community (cs.AI), and the application of these techniques to medical imaging is a growing area of research (cs.MED). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of neural networks (cs.NEURON) for segmentation tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
