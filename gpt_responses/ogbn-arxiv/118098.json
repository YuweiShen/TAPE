Additionally, the paper also uses the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which is a widely used optimization technique in machine learning. \n\nThe paper also relates to the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision) as CNNs are commonly used in computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection. \n\nFurthermore, the paper's focus on sparsity-promoting penalty terms and optimization techniques also suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). \n\nFinally, the paper's use of optimization techniques and its focus on reducing the computational complexity of CNNs also suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
