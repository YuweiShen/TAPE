The algorithm presented in the paper involves assigning primitive vectors to the paths of the input tree, which is a technique commonly used in data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the size of the drawing, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.GR). Additionally, the paper involves the use of grids, which is a topic in distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
