Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also uses state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the coreference resolution systems, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper focuses on named person coreference, which could also suggest cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
