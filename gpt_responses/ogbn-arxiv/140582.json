This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of deep learning techniques for this task, which is a popular area of research in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The authors also mention the use of GPUs for efficient training, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with the analysis of large-scale datasets, which is a topic of interest in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
