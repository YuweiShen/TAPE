The algorithm iteratively constructs the transmit vector via Approximate Message Passing (AMP). This involves information theory concepts such as channel coding and decoding, and signal processing. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning algorithm for constructing transmit vectors with restricted peak-to-average power ratios and to efficiently select a subset of transmit antennas. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper proposes a method for optimizing the use of transmit antennas in a network, which can be seen as a social network of antennas. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper proposes a method for constructing transmit vectors with restricted peak-to-average power ratios, which is relevant for multimedia applications where high power signals can cause distortion. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a method for optimizing the use of transmit antennas in a network, which is relevant for networking and internet architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
