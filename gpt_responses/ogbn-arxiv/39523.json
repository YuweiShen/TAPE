The use of symmetries in probabilistic models is also a topic of interest in database systems (cs.DB) and combinatorial optimization (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the complexity of conditioning on evidence, which is a fundamental problem in probabilistic inference and can be related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
