This falls under the field of robotics, specifically in the area of aerial robots. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics and Control). The paper also discusses the design and fabrication of the robot, which involves mechanical engineering (cs.ME). Additionally, the paper presents results demonstrating the capabilities of the robot, which may involve computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the use of the robot for various applications, which may fall under the sub-category of robotics applications (cs.ROBOTS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
