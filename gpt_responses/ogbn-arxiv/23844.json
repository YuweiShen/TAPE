This involves analyzing program features and metrics to understand and predict program performance on arbitrary hardware architectures. The paper also proposes a new metric of parallel spatial locality to better understand memory access patterns affecting efficiency across architectures. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AR (Architecture), cs.PF (Performance), cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
