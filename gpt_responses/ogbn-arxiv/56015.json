The use of the de Bruijn identity and the Dembo inequality suggests that the paper may also be relevant to statistical inference (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The MIMO aspect of the channel may also make it relevant to multimedia systems (cs.MM) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
