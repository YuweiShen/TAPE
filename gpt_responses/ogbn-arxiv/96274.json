The system combines automated information collection with video guides and operates on-board the eyewear computer. The paper focuses on the user experience and the system's ability to learn without supervision. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), followed by Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Robotics (cs.RO) due to the object detection method used. Multimedia (cs.MM) and Augmented Reality (cs.AR) are also possible sub-categories due to the mixed reality aspect of the system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
