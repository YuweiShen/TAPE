Specifically, the paper proposes a novel summarization system that leverages text classification data to improve the performance of multi-document summarization. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). \n\nAdditionally, the paper uses distributed representations, which are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning models, suggesting that it could also belong to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper's use of classification results to produce summaries suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of cs.DL (Deep Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
