It also involves wireless communication, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper discusses the implications of feedback in a multi-antenna system, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY). The use of linear dispersion codes and the focus on low-complexity decoding suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also discusses the optimization of information transmission, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
