This falls under the domain of evolutionary computing, which is a subfield of neural and evolutionary computing. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes a new mutation operator and uses a greedy constructive heuristic and a local search heuristic to generate the initial population. These techniques are commonly used in artificial intelligence for optimization problems. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The asymmetric travelling salesman problem is a well-known problem in the field of data structures and algorithms. The paper proposes a new genetic algorithm with optimal recombination to solve this problem. \n4. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) - The asymmetric travelling salesman problem is a problem in discrete mathematics. The paper proposes a new genetic algorithm with optimal recombination to solve this problem. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a genetic algorithm with optimal recombination and a new mutation operator to solve the asymmetric travelling salesman problem.
