This involves control and coordination aspects, which fall under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper studies the impact of an electric-powered AMoD system on the Texas power network, which involves computational modeling and simulation of the power network. This falls under the scope of computational engineering.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, the optimization algorithm used to solve the joint model may involve machine learning techniques. Additionally, the paper may be of interest to researchers working on machine learning for transportation systems.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper deals with autonomous vehicles and their interaction with the power network, which falls under the scope of robotics. Additionally, the paper may be of interest to researchers working on robotics for transportation systems.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper studies the interaction between the AMoD system and the power network, which involves communication and networking aspects.
