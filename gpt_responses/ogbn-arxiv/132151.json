This is an example of software engineering techniques for facilitating rapid prototyping. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper mentions data analytics tasks being performed by clients (on-board), which suggests the use of databases for storing and retrieving data. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions use cases such as iterative A/B testing of machine learning algorithms or deploying experimental algorithms on-the-fly, indicating a focus on machine learning applications. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses a platform for data analytics tasks, which involves the use of algorithms and data structures for processing and analyzing data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
