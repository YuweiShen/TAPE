The paper also evaluates the proposed model on the DeepFashion dataset, which is a popular dataset for fashion image retrieval and is commonly used in computer vision research. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with fashion images and proposes a recommendation system for fashion images. The paper also uses visual attention over the parts and a texture encoding network to learn discriminative features from weakly-supervised data. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper proposes a recommendation system for fashion images and evaluates the proposed model on the DeepFashion dataset using retrieval task. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel approach of learning discriminative features from weakly-supervised data by using visual attention over the parts and a texture encoding network. The paper also evaluates the proposed model on the DeepFashion dataset and shows that the learned features surpass the state-of-the-art in retrieval task. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with fashion images and proposes a recommendation system for fashion images. The paper also uses visual attention over the parts and a texture encoding network to learn discriminative features from weakly-supervised data.
