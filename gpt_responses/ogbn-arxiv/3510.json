The use of multi-layer codebooks and the analysis of achievable regions also suggest that the paper could be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves distributed processing of information sources, which could be relevant to the distributed computing (cs.DC) sub-category.
