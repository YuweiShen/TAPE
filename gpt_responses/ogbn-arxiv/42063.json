It also involves merging uncertainty and representativeness to enhance the similarity measurement of multi-label data with labels information. Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the paper involves developing a new algorithm for active learning, cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) as multi-label learning is commonly used in these fields, and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as the paper proposes an efficient alternating optimization method to solve the algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
