Additionally, the paper focuses on semi-supervised learning, which involves using both labeled and unlabeled data, suggesting that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of adversarial examples to encourage view difference suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of multiple deep neural networks suggests that the paper may also belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper may also belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category, as the concept of co-training was originally developed for text classification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
