The framework is applied to classification, regression, and learning to rank tasks, which are common in computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.CV, followed by cs.NE and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
