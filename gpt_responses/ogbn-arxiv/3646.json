The proposed policies rely on online learning techniques to infer optimal values for a small number of parameters, which suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The policies also aim to respect response-time targets, which implies a focus on control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of numerical simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed policies suggests a connection to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
