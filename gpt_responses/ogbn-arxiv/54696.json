The specific application of sequence labeling is commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL), which is also mentioned in the abstract. The paper also mentions the use of score functions, which are commonly used in reinforcement learning (cs.AI) and the Markovian evolution of the input sequence, which is a common concept in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions the extension of their results to bidirectional RNNs, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks such as image captioning (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
