The paper presents extensive experiments on algorithmic seq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document classification, and natural language inference, which are all tasks that fall under the categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE).
