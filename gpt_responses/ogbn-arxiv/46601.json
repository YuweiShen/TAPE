The paper also uses classic power indices from game theory to measure the importance of actors in social networks. \n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper focuses on analyzing social networks and proposes new centrality measures for them. The paper also compares the proposed measures with other classic centrality measures. \n3. cs.SOC (Social and Behavioral Sciences): The paper deals with social networks and their behavior, specifically the spread of influence phenomenon. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes new measures for analyzing social networks, which can be seen as algorithms for ranking the importance of actors in the network. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes new measures for analyzing social networks, which can be seen as a form of machine learning for ranking the importance of actors in the network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
