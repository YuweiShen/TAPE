The paper also discusses the use of learning from demonstration (cs.LG) to determine the compliance parameters for the robots. The use of compliance in assembly tasks also involves decision-making and optimization (cs.AI) to determine the best parameters for achieving the task. The paper also discusses the practical applications of the research, such as using robots in difficult locations, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY) and human-robot interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
