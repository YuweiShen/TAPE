The focus on optimizing memory usage is also relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The use of dynamic programming and graph rewriting techniques suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
