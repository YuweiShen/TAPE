The paper also discusses regret in the multi-objective setting, which is a topic in decision making and optimization (cs.DM). The use of random scalarizations to sample from desired regions of the Pareto front is a strategy that could be applied in control systems and robotics (cs.SY). Finally, the paper includes experiments with both synthetic and real-life problems, which could fall under the category of neural networks and evolutionary computation (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
