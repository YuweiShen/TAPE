The paper also discusses algorithms for computing these partial MAPs, which falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS) and computational engineering (cs.CE). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of these partial MAPs for domain-independent explanation, which could be considered a topic in social and information sciences (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
