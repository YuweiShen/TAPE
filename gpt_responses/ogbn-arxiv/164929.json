The paper focuses on the structural characteristics of heterogeneous relations and proposes different models for Affiliation Relations (ARs) and Interaction Relations (IRs). Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with heterogeneous information networks, which are a type of social network. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new model for network embedding, which is a common task in machine learning. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with the semantics of networks, which is a topic related to information retrieval. \n- cs.SOC (Computational Social Science): The paper deals with social networks and their structures, which is a topic related to computational social science. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper deals with network data and proposes a new model for network embedding, which is a topic related to databases."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
