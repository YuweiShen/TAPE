The paper also mentions the use of structural regularization, which is a common technique in machine learning. Additionally, the paper may also belong to computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories as GCCA has applications in these fields. The paper may also be relevant to data science (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as GCCA is a widely used technique in these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
