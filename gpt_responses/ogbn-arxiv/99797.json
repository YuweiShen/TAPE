The paper also uses deep neural networks (DNNs) for the detection, which falls under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the evaluation of the performance of the detectors, which can be considered as a software engineering (cs.SE) aspect. Finally, the paper uses a large real-world dataset, which involves data processing and analysis, making it relevant to data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
