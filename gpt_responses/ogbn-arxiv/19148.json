However, the use of stochastic geometry theory to develop tractable expressions for the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability and average rate of cellular networks suggests that the paper is likely to be classified under cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The focus on scheduling algorithms and optimization also suggests that cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.MM (Multimedia) are possible sub-categories. Finally, the use of analytical frameworks and numerical simulations suggests that cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
