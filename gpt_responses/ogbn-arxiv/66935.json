The algorithm also involves image processing and computer vision (CV) to estimate the terrain height. The paper also discusses the computational limitations of the rover's computer, which falls under systems and control (SY). Finally, the paper presents experimental results to validate the algorithm's performance, which involves machine learning (LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
