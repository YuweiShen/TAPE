The approach involves using residue networks (ResNets) as the neural network structure, which is a popular technique in deep learning for image recognition and natural language processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the construction of coarse models, which is a common technique in numerical analysis and scientific computing (cs.NA). The application of the approach to dynamical systems involves modeling the behavior of physical systems, which falls under the category of control and systems engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents numerical examples of long-term prediction of chaotic systems, which is a topic in dynamical systems theory (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
