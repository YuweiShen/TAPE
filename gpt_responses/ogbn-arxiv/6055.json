Moreover, the Connected Feedback Vertex Set problem can be seen as a game between two players, where one player tries to find a subset of vertices that satisfies certain constraints, while the other player tries to prevent this from happening.\n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - Although the paper does not explicitly deal with computational complexity, the Connected Feedback Vertex Set problem is known to be NP-hard, which is a topic that falls under this category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
