The paper also discusses the tradeoff between optimal retrieval cost and storage cost, which is related to cryptography (cs.CR) and coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper presents a generalized result for PIR with coded databases, which could be of interest to researchers in the field of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
