This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel hierarchical and parallel architecture, which involves optimizing the network for performance bottlenecks and multi-scale residual blocks, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the effect of neural network binarization on localization tasks, which could fall under neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper presents results for facial part segmentation, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
