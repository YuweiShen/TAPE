The paper focuses on the scalability issue of support-based clustering and proposes a new method that uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and a budget approach to address this issue. The paper also provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed method. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
