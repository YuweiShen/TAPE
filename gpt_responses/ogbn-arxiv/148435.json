The paper also discusses upper and lower bounds for learning these functions, which indicates that it could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the paper introduces a new model for learning valuation functions, which involves setting prices and observing purchase decisions, suggesting that it could also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also leverages novel structural results for learning valuation functions, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category.
