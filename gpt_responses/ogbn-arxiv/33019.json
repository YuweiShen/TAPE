The proposed framework involves training a model selector, which can be seen as a form of meta-learning, and thus falls under the sub-field of meta-learning (cs.SI). Finally, the experiments involve evaluating the framework's performance in terms of AUC and LogLoss, which are commonly used evaluation metrics in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
