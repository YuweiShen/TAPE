This involves channel estimation, which is a key aspect of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses multi-cell multiuser massive MIMO systems, which are relevant to wireless networking and communication. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a systematic design framework for hybrid beamforming, which involves the control of analog and digital beamforming. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the design of beamforming for mmWave channels, which are relevant to multimedia applications such as high-speed data transfer and video streaming. \n5. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper discusses the challenges of implementing massive MIMO in the digital domain, which requires hundreds of RF chains matching the number of antennas. This involves hardware architecture design."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
