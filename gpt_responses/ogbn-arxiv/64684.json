This involves developing a framework for modeling explanations, proposing algorithms for automatically discovering frequent templates from the database, and inferring collaborative user groups. The paper also evaluates the proposed techniques using an access log and data from the University of Michigan Health System. Given these aspects, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.DB (Databases), followed by cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
