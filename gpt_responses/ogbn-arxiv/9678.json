Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the security aspect of recommendation systems, which makes cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) another likely sub-category. The paper proposes a framework for generating fake user profiles, which involves optimization of an objective function, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a possible sub-category.
