The use of autoregressive models and the characterization of channel input feedback strategies as time-invariant and inducing asymptotic stationarity and ergodicity suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of statistical learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also involves the use of mathematical tools such as generalized difference Riccati equations and algebraic Riccati equations, which are commonly used in numerical analysis and optimization (cs.NA). Finally, the focus on stability and ergodicity of the channel output process suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
