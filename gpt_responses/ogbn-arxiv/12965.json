This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The approach is evaluated on two challenging problems related to computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper deals with the issue of concept drift, which is a common problem in data streams and falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
