The paper also discusses the complexity of the problem, which is a common theme in theoretical computer science (cs.CC). The use of PQ-trees and their applications in constrained embedding problems suggest that the paper may also belong to the data structures and algorithms category (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
