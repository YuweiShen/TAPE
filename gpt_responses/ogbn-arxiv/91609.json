The sequences are also potentially useful in cryptography, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of cyclotomic sequences suggests a connection to number theory (cs.NT). The paper also mentions the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm, which is a well-known algorithm in computer science for finding the linear complexity of a sequence, indicating a possible connection to data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to signal processing and communications (cs.SI) due to the use of sequences with specific properties."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
