The use of greedy algorithms and optimization techniques suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of stochastic gradient descent and data-dependent bounds suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-categories.
