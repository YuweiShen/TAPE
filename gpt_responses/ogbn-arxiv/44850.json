It could also belong to Information Retrieval (cs.IR) as entity linking is a common task in IR. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach that combines supervision from multiple languages, which could fall under the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also uses machine learning techniques to train a single entity linking model for multiple languages, which could fall under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on benchmark datasets, which could fall under the category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
