The proposed network is designed to mimic the relational structure of planning problems, which relates to robotics (cs.RO) and programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses a training method that balances exploration and supervised training, which is relevant to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
