The paper also draws inspiration from partial differential equations (PDEs) and uses PDE theory to derive new neural network architectures, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges associated with deep ResNets and proposes new architectures, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.
