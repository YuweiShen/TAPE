This could be seen as an application of information theory concepts to signal processing.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although the paper does not explicitly mention social or information networks, the concept of locality and sparsity is often relevant in network analysis. The method presented in the paper could potentially be applied to network data.\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper uses spherical coordinates to compute the projection of wavelets, which could be seen as a geometric approach to signal processing.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions tomographic reconstruction, which is a technique used in medical imaging and other fields that involve analyzing visual data. The method presented in the paper could potentially be applied to image processing.\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper discusses the computational costs of the proposed method, which involves reconstructing the signal using \"sliced\" wavelets. This could be seen as a numerical analysis problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
