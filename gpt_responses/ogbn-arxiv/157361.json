Information theory deals with the quantification, storage, and communication of information, which is relevant to this paper.\n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed method aims to reduce energy consumption and complexity in IoT systems, which falls under the scope of systems and control.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions the use of a Gray-coding scheme, which is a common technique in machine learning for encoding categorical variables.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses a method for transmitting information over channels, which is relevant to networking and internet architecture.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed method can be applied to audio and video transmission, which falls under the scope of multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
