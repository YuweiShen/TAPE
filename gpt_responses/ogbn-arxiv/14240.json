Specifically, the algorithm is a sparse Bayesian learning method, which is commonly used in the subfield of probabilistic machine learning (cs.LG). The algorithm is also applicable to tasks such as image classification (cs.CV) and data analysis (cs.ST), which are common applications of machine learning. Additionally, the use of truncated Gaussian distributions as priors is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
