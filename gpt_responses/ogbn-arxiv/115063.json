The modification involves removing the need for a quantitative reward function, which could also be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and game theory (cs.GT). The paper also mentions the use of neural networks, which could relate to the sub-category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and the testing of the modified algorithm on a sample game, which could be relevant to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
