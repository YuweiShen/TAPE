It also involves information theory (cs.IT) as it discusses the properties of secret sharing schemes. The paper proposes new concepts and constructions, which are related to data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implementation of the proposed scheme, which falls under computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
