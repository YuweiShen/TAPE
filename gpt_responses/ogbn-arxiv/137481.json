The tool focuses on visualizing the effect of attacks on the neurons and their connections inside a DNN, which is a common technique used in computer vision (cs.CV) and cybersecurity (cs.CR) research. Additionally, the paper mentions the importance of providing interpretable overviews of the effect of attacks, which is relevant to the field of human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
