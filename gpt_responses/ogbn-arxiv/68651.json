The paper presents a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for solving this problem for quadratic instances, which is a particular case of importance in cryptography. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of theoretical computer science that deal with cryptography (cs.CR) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also involves the use of representation theory and matrix algebra, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-categories of information theory (cs.IT), data structures (cs.DS), and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
