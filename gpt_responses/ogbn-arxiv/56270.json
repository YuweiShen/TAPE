Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a learning-based approach, which involves fine-tuning existing neural networks, and uses self-supervised learning. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with video deblurring, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
