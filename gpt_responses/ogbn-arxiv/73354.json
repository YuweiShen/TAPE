The paper also discusses the importance of safety and security in these systems, which could potentially fall under software engineering (cs.SE) and cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper uses image datasets such as ImageNet and Udacity self-driving challenge data, indicating a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
