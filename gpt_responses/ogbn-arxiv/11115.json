The paper discusses the use of Deep Dyna-Q (DDQ) and Budget-Conscious Scheduling (BCS) to allocate the budget over different stages of training. The paper also discusses the use of a user goal sampling module to generate the experiences that are most effective for policy learning. Given the focus on dialogue systems and machine learning, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of simulations and real users, which could also place it in the cs.SD (Software Engineering) or cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
