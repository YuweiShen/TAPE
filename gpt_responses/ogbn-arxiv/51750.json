The paper also explores the possibility of reverse engineering neural networks using these attacks, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses protection techniques against fault injection attacks, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on the precision error for parameter recovery, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
