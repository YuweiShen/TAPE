However, the paper also discusses the limitations of existing access control mechanisms and the need for a stronger theoretical foundation for database security, which could be categorized under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.SE (Software Engineering). Additionally, the paper presents a new access control mechanism that is provably secure, which could be categorized under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
