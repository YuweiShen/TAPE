The paper also discusses the use of discount factors in the learning process, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also relates the discussion to the exploration/exploitation dilemma, which is a common topic in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY).
