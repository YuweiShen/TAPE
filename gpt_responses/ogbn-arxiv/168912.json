The use of diffraction theory and wave optics suggests a focus on optical effects, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV) or optics (cs.OH). The paper also mentions the use of line segments to represent surface roughness, which could be related to computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the use of real-world examples suggests a possible application in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
