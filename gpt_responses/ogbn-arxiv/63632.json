The paper proposes a new method for aligning feature representations across domains, which involves calculating hardness factors for sample pairs and using them to guide the adaptation process. This approach involves machine learning techniques such as kernel methods (cs.LG) and progressive sampling (cs.AI). The paper also uses convolutional features to align hierarchical representations (cs.MM) and evaluates the method on benchmarks for object detection (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
