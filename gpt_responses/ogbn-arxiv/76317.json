The paper proposes a new formulation that allows regression using privileged information through a custom loss function. The paper also verifies the correctness, applicability, and effectiveness of the proposed method on regression and classification problems over different synthetic and real-world problems. The paper also evaluates the proposed method on the problem of protein binding affinity prediction. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
