This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT), communication systems (cs.COMM), and networked systems (cs.NI). The use of differential space-time block codes (DSTBC) also suggests a possible connection to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the mention of simulation results indicates a potential link to multimedia (cs.MM) for evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
