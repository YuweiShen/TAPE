The paper proposes a unified framework for probability mapping functions and introduces two novel sparse formulations, which are relevant to these sub-categories. The empirical evaluation of the proposed formulations on standard seq2seq tasks also suggests their relevance to these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
