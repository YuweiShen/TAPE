It also involves training and optimization of neural networks, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The quantization of weights in low bit-width CNNs also involves numerical computations, which could fall under the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the practical benefits of low bit-width CNNs, such as memory savings and faster deployment, which could be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
