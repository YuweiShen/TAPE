The paper also discusses the impact of imperfect CSI on the performance of the relay selection scheme, which is a topic related to communication systems (cs.COMM) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of simulation results, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
