The paper proposes a novel scheme for DL channel tracking that involves the use of virtual channel representation, expectation maximization algorithm, and optimal Bayesian Kalman filter, which are techniques commonly used in these sub-categories. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT, followed by cs.NI, cs.SY, cs.MM, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
