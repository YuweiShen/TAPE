The paper discusses a nonconvex formulation for this problem, which can be solved efficiently using stochastic gradient descent. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions applications in information retrieval and computer vision, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-categories. The paper also discusses optimization algorithms and convergence rates, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of diffusion approximations, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
