The use of orthogonal projections and basis vectors also suggests that the paper may fall under the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) and Linear Algebra (cs.LA) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the accuracy of approximations, which is a topic often covered in the Statistical Learning (cs.LG) and Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
