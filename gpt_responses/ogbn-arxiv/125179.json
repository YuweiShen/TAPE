The use of layered erasure broadcast channel model and the superposition of binary inputs suggest that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of channel enhancement and capacity achieving strategies, which may relate to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
