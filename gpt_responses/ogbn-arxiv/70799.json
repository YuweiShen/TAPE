The paper also discusses the performance of heuristics on discrete problems, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper mentions complexity theory, which is a fundamental concept in computer science and can be categorized under cs.CC. The paper also discusses the analysis of function evaluations, which is a common topic in optimization and can be categorized under cs.DM.
