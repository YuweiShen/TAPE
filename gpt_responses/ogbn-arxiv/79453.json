The paper also discusses the selection of regions of interest (ROI) for facial features, which is related to object detection and segmentation (cs.SD). The use of deep learning models for VSR also involves optimization and training techniques (cs.LG). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on benchmark datasets, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
