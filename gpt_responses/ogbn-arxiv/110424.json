This involves monitoring system activities in each host and searching for anomalies. The paper also proposes a domain-specific query language, SAQL, which allows analysts to express models for different types of anomalies. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DB (Databases), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
