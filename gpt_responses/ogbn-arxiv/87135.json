This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a new technology for achieving spectrum- and energy-efficient as well as cost-efficient wireless networks using IRS. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an algorithm for optimizing the power allocation and phase shifts at the passive IRS to maximize the minimum decoding SINR of all users. This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with optimizing the rate performance of downlink NOMA systems using IRS, which can have applications in multimedia communication.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes an efficient algorithm for solving the non-convex optimization problem using block coordinated decent, successive convex optimization, and semidefinite relaxation techniques. This falls under the domain of computational engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
