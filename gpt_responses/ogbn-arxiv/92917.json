The technique involves automatic remodeling of the neural network structure when encountering new classes, which requires knowledge representation and reasoning (cs.AI). The technique also involves parameter calculation and optimization, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). The performance of the technique is evaluated using standard datasets in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
