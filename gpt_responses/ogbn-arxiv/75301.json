This involves optimizing the allocation of radio resources to different slices while considering uncertain channel state information (CSI) and various constraints. This topic is closely related to several sub-categories of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), systems and control (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
