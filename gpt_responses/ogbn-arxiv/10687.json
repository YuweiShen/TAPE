The use of deep reinforcement learning and neural networks also suggests that it could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The fact that the controller accepts images of the environment as its only input suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) could also be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the mention of transferring policies to a real robot suggests that control systems (cs.SY) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
