Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning approaches, which suggests that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another likely sub-category. The investigation of properties on synthetic data and a well-known temporal corpus indicates that the paper may also be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the use of a unique textual object, a minimal underlying temporal graph, suggests that the paper may be relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
