The paper also mentions the use of inductive biases, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments conducted in the paper involve image data sets, which suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) is another likely sub-category. The paper also mentions downstream tasks, which suggests that neural networks (cs.NE) may be relevant. Finally, the paper discusses evaluation metrics, which is a common topic in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
