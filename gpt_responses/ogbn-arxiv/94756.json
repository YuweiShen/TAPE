Therefore, cs.IT is the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses a communication system with a single antenna base station and multiple users, which falls under the scope of cs.NI.\n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper deals with the security aspect of the NOMA system, which involves providing secrecy against external and internal eavesdroppers. Hence, cs.CR is also a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents closed-form expressions for the ergodic secrecy rates and the secrecy outage probability of the system, which involves system modeling and analysis. Therefore, cs.SY is a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): Although less likely, cs.MM is a possible sub-category as the paper deals with resource allocation in a communication system, which can be related to multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
