It could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as NMT systems are a popular application of AI and ML. Additionally, it could belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as the paper proposes a soft-attention based technique to make word replacements. Finally, it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) as the proposed technique is an invariance-based adversarial attack on NMT systems, which is similar to adversarial attacks in computer vision."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
