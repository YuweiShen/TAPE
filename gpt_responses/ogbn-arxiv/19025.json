The paper uses probabilistic techniques to analyze the behavior of an adversary, which is a common approach in the field of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the optimization of a certain objective function, which is a topic that falls under the category of Computational Complexity (cs.CC).
