However, the focus on storage protocols and the use of lightweight cryptography suggest that cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) is the most likely category. The paper also discusses security and robustness, which could place it in cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The use of erasure coding and metadata write-backs suggests cs.Distributed, and the focus on latency and communication rounds could place it in cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
