It also proposes a new data structure for solving the problem, which falls under data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper heavily relies on compression techniques, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.DL) and databases (cs.DB). Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency of the proposed method, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
