This involves controlling the system to balance energy and performance. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a performance model for determining the optimal voltage reduction level, which involves software engineering techniques. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the impact of reduced voltage operation on various workloads, which is relevant to distributed and parallel computing systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
