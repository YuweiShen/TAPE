The paper also proposes a framework that uses a filter to compute the relative pose between the robots, which involves system identification and control theory (cs.SY). The use of continuous estimation techniques also suggests the involvement of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and statistical learning (cs.LG) in the proposed framework."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
