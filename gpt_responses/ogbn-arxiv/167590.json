Thus, cs.LG and cs.AI are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with personalized attention, which is a topic related to user modeling and recommendation systems. Therefore, cs.SI (social and information networks) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
