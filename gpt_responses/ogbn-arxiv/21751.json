This methodology is applicable to a wide range of reinforcement learning algorithms, including Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), control systems (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
