It is also likely to belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category as it investigates the dynamics of social signals exchanged between humans and robots during a cooperative task. Additionally, the paper may fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it discusses the development of engagement models for human-robot interaction. The use of machine learning techniques to analyze the data collected during the experiments may also place this paper in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper may be relevant to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category as it involves the analysis of gaze behavior during the human-robot interaction task."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
