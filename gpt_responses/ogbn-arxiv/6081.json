The paper presents new constructions of distance oracles with improved tradeoffs between stretch, size, and query time. These constructions involve techniques from data structures, graph theory, and algorithms. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Additionally, the paper involves numerical analysis (cs.NA) and simulation and modeling (cs.SI) to evaluate the performance of the proposed constructions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
