However, the paper also discusses perception tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection, which are part of the computer vision (CV) sub-category. The use of deep learning methods for control also involves machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Finally, the paper discusses safety and verification, which are relevant to the systems (SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
