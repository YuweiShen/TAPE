The numerical studies also involve tensor classification, which is a machine learning task.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents two algorithms for solving the L1-Tucker decomposition problem, which involves manipulating and analyzing multi-way/tensor data. This is a relevant topic in data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the use of L1-norm in the Tucker decomposition, which is a measure of information. The paper also presents convergence analysis, which is a topic in information theory.\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes two numerical algorithms for solving the L1-Tucker decomposition problem, which is a numerical problem involving multi-way/tensor data. This is a relevant topic in numerical analysis.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although the paper does not explicitly mention social or information networks, the L1-Tucker decomposition can be applied to analyze data from these domains. Additionally, the paper's focus on robustness against heavy corruptions may be relevant in the context of noisy or incomplete network data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
