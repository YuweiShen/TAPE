Therefore, cs.CV and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also deals with robotics (RO) as it involves the detection of driver behavior for autonomous vehicles. The use of self-supervised and supervised learning techniques also suggests that the paper may belong to cs.AI. Finally, the fusion of multimodal cues suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
