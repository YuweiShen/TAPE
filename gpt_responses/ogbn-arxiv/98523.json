The use of tailored loss function and data augmentation techniques suggests the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also discusses the effect of disjoint train and test sets on classification performance, which could be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
