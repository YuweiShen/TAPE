These problems are typically studied in the context of formal languages and automata theory, which falls under the category of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). The paper also makes use of results from the theory of formal languages and rewriting systems, which are relevant to the sub-categories of Computational Complexity (cs.CC), Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM), Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL), and Information Theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
