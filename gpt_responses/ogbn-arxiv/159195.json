The paper discusses the challenges of deduplication in cloud servers running multiple services or applications, which falls under the scope of distributed computing (cs.DC) and operating systems (cs.OS). The proposed mechanism involves a caching mechanism and prioritization of data streams, which are related to data structures (cs.DS) and architecture (cs.AR). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed mechanism, which involves database (cs.DB) related metrics such as deduplication efficiency."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
