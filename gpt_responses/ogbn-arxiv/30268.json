The paper also adapts state-of-the-art methods for detecting out of distribution images for image classification to this new task, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.AI). The evaluation of the proposed method involves comparing it with other methods, which is a common practice in machine learning research (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the potential applications of the proposed method in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous driving, which involves computer security (cs.CR) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
