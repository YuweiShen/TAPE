This falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB). The paper also discusses concurrent implementations of the quotient filter, which falls under the category of parallel and distributed computing (cs.DC) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes variants of the quotient filter that aim to reduce the number of status bits and simplify concurrent implementations, which falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
