The paper also introduces a new lattice problem, the lattice membership problem, which is a generalization of the integer programming feasibility problem. These topics are closely related to several sub-fields of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), computational complexity (cs.CC), computational geometry (cs.CG), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
