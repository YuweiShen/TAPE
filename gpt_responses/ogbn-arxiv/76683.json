However, it could be considered under the catch-all category of \"Other Computer Science\". \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although not directly related to social or information networks, the paper deals with the design of distributed controllers, which could be applied to networked systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
