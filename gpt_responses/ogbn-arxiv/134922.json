The use of total variation of measures and the Fisher geodesic distance also suggests a connection to Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Numerical Analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the applications mentioned in the abstract, such as Laplace inversion and Gaussian mixtures estimation, suggest a possible connection to Signal Processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
