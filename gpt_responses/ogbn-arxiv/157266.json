The use of deep regressors and an adaptive weighting scheme suggests that this paper is likely to be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the use of an ensemble of regressors and a tree-structured gate suggests that this paper may also be relevant to subcategories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
