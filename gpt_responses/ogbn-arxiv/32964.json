The paper proposes a new mechanism to boost the performance of existing link predictors, which involves training knowledge graph embedding models (cs.CL) in a new feature space obtained by decompressing functions. The paper also evaluates the proposed method on several benchmark knowledge graphs (cs.DB) and advanced link prediction systems, and compares it with other approaches in the literature (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
