This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper also proposes a novel multi-task and multi-modal architecture that learns joint relationships and combinations of shared and task-specific representations, which falls under the domain of machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper uses a long short-term memory network (LSTM) for temporal modeling, which is a popular technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
