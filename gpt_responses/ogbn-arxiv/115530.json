The paper also discusses the impact of the attacker's position on the security of CRKG, which involves the study of channel statistics and mutual information, and hence can be categorized under information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper involves the practical setup of three parties and the evaluation of security metrics, which can be related to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
