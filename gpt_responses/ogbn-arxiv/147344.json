This involves using machine learning techniques to analyze and visualize large-scale fMRI datasets. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves distributed computing and data management, which could fall under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
