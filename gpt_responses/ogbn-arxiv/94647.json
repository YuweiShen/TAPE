This involves reasoning about pairwise relations in the form of relative 3D pose. Given that the paper deals with computer vision and robotics, cs.CV and cs.RO are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves learning-based methods, which suggests cs.LG as another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves reasoning and prediction, which suggests cs.AI as another possible sub-category.
