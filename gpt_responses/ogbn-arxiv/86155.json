The presence of an eavesdropper and the need to protect against them suggests that the paper may also belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of limited communication resources and the need to optimize performance suggests that the paper may also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The consideration of a distributed system with two components suggests that the paper may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category.
