This involves using high-dimensional data acquired from biological experiments such as next generation sequencing. The paper also discusses the use of contrastive metric learning to adjust for batch effects. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of whole-genome cell-free DNA data from 817 patients, which suggests a possible fit with q-bio.QM (Quantitative Methods) and q-bio.GN (Genomics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
