This involves resource allocation, matching game with externalities, and robust beamforming to cope with channel uncertainty. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also proposes a new matching utility function, which falls under cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). The use of probabilistic constraints and complexity analysis suggests cs.SY (Systems and Control) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed CoMP scheme and methods involves performance metrics, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
