The paper also discusses the use of information abstraction and computational complexity, which are relevant to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. The algorithms introduced in the paper involve iterative processes and convergence, which are topics in the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category.
