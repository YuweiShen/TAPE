This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also considers the mean square error (MSE) criterion, which is commonly used in control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the use of multiple antennae and linear filters suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
