The use of layered coding and successive refinement is a common technique in multimedia communication (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). The optimization problem formulated in the paper involves convex optimization, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and networking (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
