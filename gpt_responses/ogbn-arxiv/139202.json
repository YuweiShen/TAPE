Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses congestion detection algorithms and radio link management, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses the performance improvements of the proposed solution, which could fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR) or systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
