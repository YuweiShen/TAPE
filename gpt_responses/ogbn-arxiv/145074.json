This falls under the domain of cryptography and security.\n\n2. cs.AR (Architecture) - The paper proposes a hardware-based solution to mitigate Spectre attacks, which involves modifying the branch prediction structures and implementing a precise speculation-aware hardware stack. This falls under the domain of computer architecture.\n\n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering) - The paper discusses the adoption of CFI by commodity software (e.g., Windows and Android) and commodity hardware (e.g., Intel's CET and ARM's BTI), which suggests a software engineering perspective on the problem.\n\n4. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper proposes a solution that involves constraining the target of an indirect branch to a set of legal targets defined by a pre-calculated control-flow graph (CFG), which is a programming language concept.\n\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a hardware-based solution to mitigate Spectre attacks, which involves modifying the branch prediction structures and implementing a precise speculation-aware hardware stack.
