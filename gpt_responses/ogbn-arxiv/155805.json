The paper specifically focuses on the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is a well-studied framework in AI for modeling decision-making under uncertainty. The paper proposes a new algorithm called DESPOT, which is a sparse approximation of the standard belief tree, and shows that it can achieve near-optimal performance with a regret bound that depends on the representation size of the optimal policy. The paper also introduces a regularization technique to balance the estimated value of a policy under the sampled scenarios and the policy size, thus avoiding overfitting. Given these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
