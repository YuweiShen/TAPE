This involves optimizing the selection of transmitting devices and file combinations to minimize the completion time. The paper also considers the realistic scenario of a partially connected network, where devices can only target devices in their transmission range. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Signal Processing (cs.SI), Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
