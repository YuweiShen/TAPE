The paper also discusses the use of statistical knowledge to improve the decoding process, which is related to system theory (cs.SY) and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions the application of these techniques to low-complexity energy-efficient transceivers, which is related to networking and internet-of-things (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
