Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also discusses the time and space complexity of the proposed data structures, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC) and computational efficiency (cs.CE). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of the proposed data structures for text search and indexing, which is a topic in information retrieval (cs.IR) and data mining (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
