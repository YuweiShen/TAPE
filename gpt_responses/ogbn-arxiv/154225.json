The case study of using the KADABRA algorithm for betweenness centrality approximation suggests that the paper is also related to network analysis (cs.NI) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the use of load-acquire and store-release operations implies that the paper may also be related to memory management (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
