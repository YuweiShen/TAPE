The proposed method involves designing view adaptive neural networks, which involves learning and determining the most suitable observation viewpoints, which is a task that falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves designing a two-stream scheme for fusing the scores of the two networks, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves extensive experimental evaluations, which may involve the use of neural networks and optimization techniques, which are common in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
