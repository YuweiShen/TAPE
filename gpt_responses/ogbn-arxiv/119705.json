Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) framework, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of gradient-based optimization to explore the exponential search space is also related to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with the compression of ConvNets, which is a topic in distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
