This topic is relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including cyberspace and society (cs.CY), information retrieval (cs.IR), digital libraries (cs.DL), social and information networks (cs.SI), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). However, given the focus on web search and data mining, as well as the use of controlled experiments, we believe that cs.CY and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
