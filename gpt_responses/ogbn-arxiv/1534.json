This involves techniques from information theory (cs.IT) and optical communications (cs.OH). The paper also discusses numerical simulations, which could fall under networked systems (cs.NI) or physics (cs.PH). Finally, the paper deals with signal processing techniques, which could fall under signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
