The proposed scheme also involves multiple antennas and signal processing techniques (cs.NI, cs.SY), which are common topics in the field of wireless communication. Finally, the paper presents computer simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
