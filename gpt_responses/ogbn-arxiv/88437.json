The use of different layout algorithms for trees and sparse graphs suggests a focus on data structures (cs.DS) and computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the task of performing furthest-pair or shortest-path tasks on the drawings suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
