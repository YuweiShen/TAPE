The paper also mentions the use of subfield-subcodes of $J$-affine variety codes, which are a type of error-correcting code, indicating a possible connection to coding theory (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper provides new and good LCD codes, which could fall under the category of data structures (cs.DS) or signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
