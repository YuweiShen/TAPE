Therefore, cs.DB is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses machine learning applications, which could potentially place it in cs.LG or cs.AI. The use of information theory in the definition of approximation suggests cs.IT as a possible sub-category. Finally, the scalability experiments could also be relevant to cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
