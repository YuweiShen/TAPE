Additionally, the study involves human participants and their behavior in response to shoulder surfing attacks, which could also be classified under human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of video simulations and live simulations also involves the use of technology to model and analyze human behavior, which could fall under social and information sciences (cs.SI) or cybernetics (cs.CY).
