The algorithmic aspect of the paper suggests that it could also belong to the data structures and algorithms category (cs.DS). The paper involves optimization of a scheme, which could be related to machine learning or optimization (cs.LG). The use of encryption and decryption suggests that the paper could also belong to the information theory category (cs.IT).
