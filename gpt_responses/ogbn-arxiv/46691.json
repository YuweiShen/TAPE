The use of partial channel state information at transmitters (CSIT) is a key aspect of the proposed strategy, which is a topic related to networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of zero-forcing beamforming, which is a topic related to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a power allocation strategy that jointly minimizes the outage probability of K UTs, which is a topic related to game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
