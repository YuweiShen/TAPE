The system also uses visual navigation to find the exact drop-off location, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The authors also mention testing their system components in simulated environments, which could involve machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
