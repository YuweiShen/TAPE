The proposed Modality Compensation Network (MCN) is built on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are popular machine learning techniques (cs.LG). The paper also discusses different adaptation schemes to narrow the distance between source and auxiliary modal distributions, which involves some level of optimization and algorithm design (cs.AI). The use of skeletons as an auxiliary modality is related to motion capture and pose estimation, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a method for adaptive representation learning, which is a common topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
