The use of multiple antennas and multiple users also suggests the involvement of networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the mention of statistical knowledge and asymptotic analysis points towards the possibility of mathematical modeling and optimization (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
