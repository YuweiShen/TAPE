The paper also discusses the use of evaluation metrics and the exploration-exploitation trade-off, which are topics that are commonly studied in machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper uses visual inputs to navigate through mazes, which is a problem that is often tackled in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of transferring learned knowledge to unseen maps, which is a topic that is relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
