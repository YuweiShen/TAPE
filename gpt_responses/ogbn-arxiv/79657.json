The proposed method leverages associative networks, which are a type of graph-based data structure commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) applications. The method is also shown to be computationally inexpensive, which is a desirable trait in systems for large-scale data processing and storage (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
