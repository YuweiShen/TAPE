Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves the use of deep learning models and techniques for image reconstruction and matching, which makes it relevant to sub-categories such as cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with security and privacy concerns related to CCTV surveillance, which makes it relevant to the sub-category cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
