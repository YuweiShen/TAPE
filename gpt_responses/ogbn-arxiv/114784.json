Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also uses machine learning techniques, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper discusses hyperparameter optimization, which could be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions the use of Huber loss function, which could be categorized under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
