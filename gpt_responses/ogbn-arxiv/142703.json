The paper also uses various deep learning techniques such as LSTM-CRF, sequence-to-sequence models, and contextual embeddings such as ELMo, BERT, and Flair, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
