The use of ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs) and 2-dags also suggests a connection to computer graphics (cs.CG). The concept of restrictive acceptance and the introduction of the class EP are related to the study of logic and automata, which are topics in the sub-categories of logic in computer science (cs.LO) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
