The paper also introduces a new parameter for directed graphs, which falls under the Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) sub-category. The use of a noisy channel and a noiseless but expensive channel may also be relevant to the Networked and Distributed Systems (cs.NI) sub-category. The exploration of the new parameter's relations to other digraph parameters may fall under the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category. Finally, the paper's investigation of specific directed graphs may also be relevant to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
