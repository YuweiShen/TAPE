The extension problem and the computation of higher homotopy groups are fundamental problems in algebraic topology, and their algorithmic and computational complexity have been studied extensively in computer science. The paper uses techniques from computational geometry, discrete mathematics, logic, and graph theory to prove its results. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
