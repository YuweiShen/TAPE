The proposed approach involves using adaptive patch-of-interest composition to balance detection accuracy and speed, which could also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the approach could be applied to multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories, as object detection is a crucial task in both fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
