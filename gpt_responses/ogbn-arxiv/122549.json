The algorithm is substantially faster than the previous state-of-the-art algorithm and evaluates a multivariate generalization of the Tutte polynomial. The paper also provides a polynomial-space variant of the algorithm and extends the result to Chung and Graham's cover polynomial. Given the focus on graph algorithms and combinatorial optimization, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
