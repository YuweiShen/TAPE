The proposed framework involves sensor fusion, which is a common technique in robotics and computer vision. The paper also mentions the use of existing VO/VIO approaches, which are related to visual odometry and visual-inertial odometry, both of which are subfields of computer vision. Therefore, cs.RO and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves optimization, which is a common technique in machine learning and control systems, making cs.LG and cs.SY likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper proposes a general framework that can fuse various global sensors, which involves some level of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
