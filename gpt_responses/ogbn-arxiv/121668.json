The paper is specifically written for readers with a background in computer science or similar, which suggests that it is likely to be submitted to arXiv CS. The most likely sub-category is cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), as fair division is a classic problem in game theory. The other likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MA (Multiagent Systems), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), as these sub-categories are closely related to computational social choice and multiagent systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
