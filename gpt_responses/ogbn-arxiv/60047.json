The proposed approach involves semi-supervised learning, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of graph construction and neighbor preservation, which are techniques commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach using performance metrics commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL), such as mean average precision (MAP)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
