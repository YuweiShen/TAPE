The paper also discusses the use of low-precision networks, which is a technique for reducing the energy and area requirements of deep neural networks, making it relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the optimization of training techniques, which is relevant to the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
