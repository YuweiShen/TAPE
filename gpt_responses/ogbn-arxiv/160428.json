The problem involves dividing a resource (land) among multiple parties, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses different ways to assess fairness, which involves analyzing and manipulating data, making it relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and social networks (cs.SI).
