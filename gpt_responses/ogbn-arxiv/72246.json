The paper proposes a new model that improves upon the state-of-the-art dynamic key value memory network (DKVMN) by incorporating adaptive knowledge growth and an additional loss term to regularize forgetting. This work is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it proposes a new deep learning-based model for knowledge tracing. It could also be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) as it involves natural language processing and modeling of student knowledge. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.ED (Education) and cs.CY (Computers and Society) as it has implications for educational technology and the use of machine learning in education."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
