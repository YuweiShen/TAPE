Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the mathematical foundations of communication and information processing. The paper also evaluates the variations of different performance parameters in several typical operating scenarios, which suggests the relevance of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.MM (Multimedia) categories. Moreover, the paper analyzes the capacity and throughput reduction in the presence of the user body, which indicates the relevance of cs.AR (Augmented Reality) and cs.EM (Electromagnetics) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
