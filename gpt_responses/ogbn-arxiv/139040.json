The paper also discusses the violation of Bell's inequalities, which is a topic in computational complexity theory (cs.CC). The use of entanglement in measurements and evolutions may also have applications in programming languages (cs.PL) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
