This is a common topic in numerical analysis. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although the paper does not explicitly deal with social or information networks, the problem of recovering two vectors from their entrywise product can arise in network analysis. \n5. cs.SP (Signal Processing): The paper deals with the problem of recovering signals from their entrywise product, which is a common problem in signal processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
