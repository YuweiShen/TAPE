This work involves computer vision (CV) techniques for image analysis and machine learning (ML) techniques for classification. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also uses deep learning techniques, which fall under the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper involves information retrieval (IR) techniques for feature extraction and classification, which falls under the sub-category cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also involves artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for classification, which falls under the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper involves multimedia (MM) techniques for image analysis, which falls under the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
