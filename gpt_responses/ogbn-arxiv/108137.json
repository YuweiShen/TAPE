The paper proposes a novel graph-based network architecture for achieving isometry invariance, which involves learning graph-based features that are inherently invariant to isometric transformations such as rotation and translation of input images. This approach involves replacing classical convolution and pooling layers in deep networks with graph spectral convolution and dynamic graph pooling layers. Therefore, this paper is also likely to be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
