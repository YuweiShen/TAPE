This involves techniques from computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), which are covered by the sub-categories cs.CV and cs.CL respectively. The proposed model also involves machine learning (ML) techniques such as state tracking and loss functions, which fall under the sub-categories cs.AI, cs.LG, and cs.IR.
