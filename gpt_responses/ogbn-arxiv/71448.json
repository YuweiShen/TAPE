Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves the use of FPGAs, which falls under the category of cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) and cs.ET (Embedded Systems). The paper also discusses the hardware and software complexities of the created SUCs, which falls under the category of cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper involves the design of optimally structured ciphers, which falls under the category of cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
