Information theory is closely related to the problem of sensing and processing information from noisy and limited observations, which is the focus of this paper. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - Cognitive radio networks are a type of wireless network, and the paper deals with the problem of collaborative sensing among the nodes in the network. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with the problem of collaborative sensing, which involves multiple nodes in the network sharing information to improve the accuracy of spectrum sensing. This falls under the domain of social and information networks. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper uses matrix completion techniques to reduce the amount of sensing information needed for accurate spectrum sensing. Matrix completion is a technique used in machine learning to recover missing or incomplete data. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the problem of spectrum sensing in wireless networks, which involves processing and analyzing signals. This falls under the domain of multimedia, which deals with the representation, processing, and communication of multimedia data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
