The proposed method involves a learning strategy that drops easy samples and focuses on hard ones, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the memory recall of the network to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed method on downstream tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation, which are related to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
