This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the use of Graph Convolutional Networks, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL/cs.IR). Additionally, the paper discusses the challenge of adding new modalities to the model, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
