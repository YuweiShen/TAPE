The paper also presents dynamic algorithms for other classical problems on strings, such as computing the longest repeat, the longest palindrome, and the longest Lyndon substring. These topics are typically studied in the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational complexity (cs.CC), formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL), and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
