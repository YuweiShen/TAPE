The use of probabilities and capacity constraints suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). The mention of a protocol and memory usage suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of Systems and Control (cs.SY). The use of probabilities and convergence properties suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS).
