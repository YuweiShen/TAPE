The use of raw skin deformation data for control and learning tasks involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The application of the proposed controllers in a challenging assembly task also involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
