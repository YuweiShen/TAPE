The paper focuses on optimization-based meta-learning algorithms, which are commonly used in deep learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also experiments on benchmark datasets commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
