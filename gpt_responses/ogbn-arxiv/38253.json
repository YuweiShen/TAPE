Morgan Quorum blockchain for the Saranyu tenant and service management microservice, which is designed to connect buyers of virtual services with providers of those services on a cloud computing platform. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the Service Manager microservice, which provides multitenant support for containerized services built for deployment and orchestration using Docker that were originally not designed to be managed through Saranyu. This involves software engineering considerations such as containerization and orchestration. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions the use of the Quorum blockchain, which provides a tamper evident and tamper resistant distributed ledger, for ensuring trustworthiness in the provision of service resources to tenants. This involves cryptography and security considerations. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper provides comprehensive performance and scalability data measured on the Saranyu REST API, which involves data structures and algorithms for processing and analyzing the data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
