The paper proposes a method for planning the required motions autonomously, which involves modeling the task of parts assembly as a belief space planning problem, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The method also involves controlling the system using impedance control, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of simulated and real-world experiments, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques for training and testing the system, falling under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper mentions the use of CAD models as input, which suggests the use of computer vision techniques for processing the input, falling under the category of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
