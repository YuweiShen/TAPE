The paper focuses on wireless backhaul links and proposes models to predict the probability of energy-efficient relaying, the spatial distribution of energy consumption, and the average interference generated by relays. The paper also proposes a new performance metric that jointly captures both aspects of energy and interference and characterizes the optimal number and location of relays. The paper's content is related to network infrastructure, wireless communication, and signal processing, which are all subcategories of cs.NI, cs.IT, and cs.SY. The paper also discusses the use of coding schemes, which falls under the subcategory of cs.MM. Finally, the paper deals with interference, which is a topic in the subcategory of cs.CR. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NI, cs.IT, cs.SY, cs.MM, and cs.CR, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
