The use of Gaussian Processes for model selection and hyper-parameter optimization is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG), and the paper also mentions the use of probability of improvement, which is a common criterion in Bayesian optimization (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of random search, which is a common technique in neural network optimization (cs.NE).
