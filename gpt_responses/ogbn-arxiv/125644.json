This is a core area of computer vision research.\n2. cs.RO (Robotics) - The proposed algorithm has potential applications in robotics, particularly in multi-robot systems where tracking multiple objects across multiple cameras is important.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The proposed algorithm uses a Bayesian filter for multi-view multi-object filtering, which involves probabilistic modeling and inference. This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes an algorithm that can handle occlusion and misdetection, which are common challenges in computer vision and robotics. This is a key area of research in artificial intelligence.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The proposed algorithm operates on multi-camera video data and provides 3D trajectory estimates of the objects.
