This involves digital mapping, CAD modeling, 3D printing, and controlled casting. The experiments conducted with different types of fingerprint readers demonstrate the usefulness of these targets for controlled and repeatable fingerprint reader evaluations and also fingerprint reader interoperability studies. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by cryptography and security (cs.CR), multimedia (cs.MM), human-computer interaction (cs.HC), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
