This is a common problem in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), which falls under the cs.AI sub-category. The paper also involves optimization techniques and algorithms, which are relevant to the cs.LG sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with the analysis of data structures and algorithms, which is relevant to the cs.DS sub-category. The paper also involves control systems and optimization, which are relevant to the cs.SY sub-category.
