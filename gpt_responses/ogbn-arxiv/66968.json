The paper also mentions the use of structured linear algebra and polynomial multiplication, which are common topics in computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
