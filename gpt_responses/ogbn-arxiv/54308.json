This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SD (Software Engineering), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). However, given the focus on statistical analysis and the use of geometrical tools, cs.DS and cs.CG are less likely. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.SI, and cs.SD, in that order, followed by cs.DS and cs.CG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
