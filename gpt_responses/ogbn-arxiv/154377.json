This involves designing novel detection layers and using a max-pooling based weakly-supervised object detection technique. These techniques are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. Additionally, the paper involves regression and clustering techniques, which are also commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper deals with the evaluation of the proposed method, which involves analyzing the performance of the algorithm and visualizing the results. This type of evaluation is commonly done in computer security (cs.CR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
