Therefore, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves cryptography and information theory, which suggests cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.IT (Information Theory) as likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses functions and their properties, which could place it in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
