This topic is commonly studied in the information theory (cs.IT), signal processing (cs.SP), and machine learning (cs.LG) communities. The paper also establishes sufficient conditions for the StRIP property and gives examples of matrix families that have the property, which involves mathematical analysis and numerical computations, suggesting that the paper may also be relevant to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
