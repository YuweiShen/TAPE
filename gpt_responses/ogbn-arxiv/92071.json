The paper also discusses the construction of codes with low redundancy and efficient encoding and decoding algorithms, which are topics in distributed systems (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also mentions the use of Guess & Check codes, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the generalization of the codes to deletions that are localized within multiple windows, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
