It also introduces a new measure for evaluating probabilistic object detection, which involves uncertainty estimation and probabilistic reasoning, making it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the importance of object detection for deployment on robots and embodied AI systems, which falls under robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
