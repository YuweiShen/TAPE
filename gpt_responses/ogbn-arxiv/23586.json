The use of normal forms and decision procedures suggests that the paper could belong to cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also discusses the use of Binary Decision Diagrams, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence, suggesting that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) could be another relevant sub-category. The paper's focus on propositional logic and its operators suggests that cs.PL (Programming Languages) could also be a relevant sub-category. The paper's use of interval-based reasoning and its focus on model construction suggest that cs.LG (Machine Learning) could be another relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on systematic reduction of infinite-time reasoning to finite-time reasoning suggests that cs.SE (Software Engineering) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
