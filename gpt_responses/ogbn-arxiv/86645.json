The paper also leverages cross-modal embeddings from image and video captioning models, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper proposes an end-to-end neural network framework, which involves training steps and fixed model reuse approach, indicating that it falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also involves similarity computation, which falls under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of CNNs and LSTMs for feature extraction and combines identification and verification models, indicating that it falls under the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
