This topic is closely related to machine learning and computer vision, which are covered by cs.LG and cs.CV. The paper also mentions the use of an $\\ell_1$-based penalty, which is a common technique in compressed sensing and signal processing, covered by cs.IT and cs.SI. Finally, the paper discusses the computational efficiency of the proposed method, which is relevant to numerical analysis and optimization, covered by cs.NA."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
