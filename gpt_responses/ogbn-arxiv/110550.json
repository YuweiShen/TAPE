The paper proposes an algorithm portfolio for SAEAs, which is a technique used to reduce the risk of choosing an inappropriate algorithm for computationally expensive problems (CEPs). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper proposes the use of reinforcement learning techniques, which are commonly studied in the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Finally, the paper is focused on optimization problems, which are commonly studied in the sub-category cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
