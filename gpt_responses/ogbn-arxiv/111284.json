The use of lemmas and unit propagation in the resolution refinements also suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the mention of proof trace extensions and clause learning algorithms suggests a possible connection to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
