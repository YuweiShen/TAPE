The paper focuses on sparsifying fully-coupled operators in existing CNNs, which is a common technique used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also introduces tuning parameters to control the trade-off between accuracy and computational costs, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) research. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on benchmark problems from image classification and semantic segmentation, which are common tasks in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
