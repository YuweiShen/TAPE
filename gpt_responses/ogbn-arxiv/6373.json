The paper also uses the publicly available Stanford drone dataset (SDD) for evaluation, which is a computer vision dataset. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The problem of trajectory forecasting is relevant to robotics, as it is important for robots to be able to predict the future trajectories of agents in their environment. The paper proposes a policy learned using maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning policy (MaxEnt IRL), which is a common technique in robotics. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel approach to trajectory forecasting that involves learning a policy and using it to generate plans, which is a machine learning problem. The paper also proposes an attention-based trajectory generator, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel approach to trajectory forecasting that involves learning a policy and using it to generate plans, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence. The paper also proposes an attention-based trajectory generator, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The problem of trajectory forecasting is relevant to systems and control, as it is important for control systems to be able to predict the future trajectories of agents in their environment"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
