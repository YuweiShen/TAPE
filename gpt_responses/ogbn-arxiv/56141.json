This involves the use of trusted execution environments, which are commonly used in the field of computer security (cs.CR). The paper also discusses achieving high transaction throughput and low latency, which are topics related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.Distributed). The use of trusted execution environments also involves system-level programming and hardware architecture, which are topics related to systems and architecture (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation and deployment of the framework, which involves software engineering practices and techniques (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
