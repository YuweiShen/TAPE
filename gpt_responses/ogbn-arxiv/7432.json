The focus on dataflow and Kahn process networks suggests a connection to distributed, parallel, and concurrent computing (cs.DC). The application examples from video processing and wireless communications suggest a connection to computer architecture (cs.AR) and systems and control (cs.SY). The use of OpenCL platforms suggests a connection to embedded systems (cs.ET) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
