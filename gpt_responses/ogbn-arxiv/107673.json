This falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also introduces a formalism for treating all answers as observations, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper tests the proposed method in simulation and on real users, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
