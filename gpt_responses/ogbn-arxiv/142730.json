The use of semantic segmentation networks for feature extraction suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The robustness and accuracy of the proposed method suggest that it may also belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The application of the method to aerial images suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the use of the method for registration suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
