The use of low-resolution ADCs and hybrid analog-and-digital beamforming also involves signal processing and control systems (cs.SY). The paper specifically focuses on millimeter wave communications, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper introduces a receiver with learning-based detection, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
