The paper proposes new crossover operators to enhance the performance of genetic algorithms, which is a topic related to optimization and search algorithms (cs.DS). The experiments conducted in the paper involve solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is a well-known problem in the field of machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). Finally, the paper proposes selection strategies for the crossover operators, which is a topic related to robotics and control (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
