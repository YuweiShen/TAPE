While the paper is focused on systems and control, it may not fit neatly into any of the more specific sub-categories. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This category is less likely, but the use of optimization techniques and approximations may be related to algorithms commonly used in computer science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
