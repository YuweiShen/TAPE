The paper also mentions weakly supervised learning, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of Fisher vectors and convolutional neural network features suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach using the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, which is commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
