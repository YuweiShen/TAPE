This is a typical problem in distributed computing, and the paper proposes a solution that combines edge and cloud computing. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with data generated from the Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT), which is a network of mobile devices and fog nodes. The paper discusses the challenges of ingesting data streams from a vast number of nodes and devices, and managing data flow between the edge and the cloud. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper discusses data processing tasks such as data filtering, data cleaning, and low-level data contextualization, which are typical tasks in database systems. The paper also mentions graph processing, which is a popular technique in graph databases. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper mentions that graphs are efficient representations used in mobility analytics because they unify knowledge about connectivity, proximity, and interaction among moving things. This is a typical problem in social and information networks, where the focus is on analyzing the structure and dynamics of networks. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper does not explicitly discuss social or ethical issues related to mobility analytics, but it does mention that"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
