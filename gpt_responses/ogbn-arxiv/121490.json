This falls under the category of machine learning and neural networks, which is covered by cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the evaluation of the NALU's performance, which involves measuring its ability to learn arithmetic extrapolation.
