The paper also discusses the use of regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of cross-modal ranking and triplet domain specific images suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the optimization of low-rank constraints, which is a topic in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
