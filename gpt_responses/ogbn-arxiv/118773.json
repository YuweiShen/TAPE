The paper also uses tools from information theory, such as subgaussian distributions. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the problem of finding a constructive version of Banaszczyk's vector balancing theorem, which is a fundamental problem in algorithm design. The paper also proposes efficient algorithms for implementing the framework. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the complexity of the problem of constructing a signed combination of vectors, and proposes efficient algorithms for solving the problem under certain assumptions. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses stochastic gradient ascent, a common optimization technique in machine learning, to implement the recentering procedure for asymmetric bodies. \n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper proposes efficient algorithms for implementing the framework, which involves computing subgaussian distributions and performing stochastic gradient ascent."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
