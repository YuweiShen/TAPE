The use of deep learning approaches for this task suggests a focus on Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The integration of data scientists and biologists also suggests a potential focus on Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) and Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) for the development of new techniques for analyzing large-scale acoustic data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
