The use of multiple antennas at the hybrid access point (H-AP) and the analysis of achievable outage probability and average throughput suggest a focus on Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) and Systems and Control (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of closed-form expressions for suboptimal designs, which could fall under Multimedia (cs.MM) or Computer Communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
