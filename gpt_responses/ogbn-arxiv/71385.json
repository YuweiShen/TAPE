The algorithms involve techniques from randomized and deterministic approximation algorithms, which are commonly studied in the subfields of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves optimization and combinatorial techniques, which are commonly studied in the subfields of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
