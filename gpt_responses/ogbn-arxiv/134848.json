This approach is likely to be of interest to researchers in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), particularly those working on MRC, text understanding, and information retrieval. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers topics related to NLP and ML. Other possible sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CV (Computer Vision), as these sub-categories also cover topics related to NLP and ML, and may be relevant to researchers working on coreference resolution using MRC techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
