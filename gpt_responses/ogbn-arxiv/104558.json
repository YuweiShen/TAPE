The method is specifically applied to image classification tasks using convolutional neural networks (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of the method with different architectures, such as AlexNet and GoogLeNet, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also mentions the practicality of the method for everyone who trains convolutional neural networks, which suggests a focus on practical applications (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of the method on the CIFAR-10 dataset and the ImageNet dataset, which are commonly used in computer vision research (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
