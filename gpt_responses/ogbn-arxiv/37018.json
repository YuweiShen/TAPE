This is a fundamental problem in information theory, and the paper proposes a novel channel estimator and receiver architecture to address it. \n2. cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on the design and implementation of a reliable OFDM receiver, which is a key component in wireless communication systems. The proposed receiver architecture and algorithms can be applied to various wireless communication standards, such as Wi-Fi, LTE, and 5G. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a system-level solution to the problem of low-resolution quantization communication. The proposed receiver architecture and algorithms involve various system components, such as automatic gain control, noise power estimation, and synchronization. \n4. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper proposes a hardware-efficient OFDM receiver architecture that can operate with ultra-low-resolution ADCs. The proposed architecture involves various hardware components, such as FFT, channel estimator, and demodulator. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes novel algorithms for channel estimation and data detection in the presence of severe nonlinear distortion caused by low-resolution ADCs. The proposed algorithms involve various data structures, such as extrinsic information and likelihood functions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
