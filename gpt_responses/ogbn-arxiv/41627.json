The paper also focuses on designing a light weight network architecture for mobile devices, which falls under the category of mobile computing (cs.MM). The proposed system is trained end-to-end, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the system involves object tracking across frames, which is a subfield of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
