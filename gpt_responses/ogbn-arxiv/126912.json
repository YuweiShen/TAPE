The focus on the non-determinism from GPUs suggests a potential overlap with research on hardware acceleration for deep learning (cs.NE). The paper also highlights the need for more robust evaluation strategies, which could be relevant to research on benchmarking and evaluation of machine learning models (cs.AI) and research on reproducibility and reliability of scientific results (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
