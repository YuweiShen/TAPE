The use of Line-of-Sight (LoS) communication and the need to maintain visibility-based connectivity suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY). The algorithms proposed in the paper involve optimization and decision-making, which are common topics in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.MA, cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
