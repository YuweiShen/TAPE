The paper focuses on joint action, in which humans and robots move together synchronously. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is Robotics (cs.RO), followed by Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
