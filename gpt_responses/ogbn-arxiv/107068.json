The focus on product distributions and the lack of reliance on complexity measures suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and combinatorics (cs.DS). The specific applications to auctions, prophet inequalities, and Pandora's problem suggest a connection to game theory (cs.GT) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
