The paper also discusses the incorporation of spatial information and learning spatial priors, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The application areas of road detection and urban scene understanding suggest that the paper may also be relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and computer graphics (cs.CR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
