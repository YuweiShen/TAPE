The proposed method, Stochastic Activation Pruning (SAP), involves modifying the activations of a neural network to make it more robust against adversarial examples. This falls under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and cryptography and security (cs.CR). Additionally, the use of game theory concepts in the approach may also make it relevant to the sub-category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
