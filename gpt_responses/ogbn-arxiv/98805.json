The paper also discusses the use of random unitary matrix multiplication, which is a technique commonly used in the field of Network Information Theory (cs.NI). The paper also touches upon the topic of system optimization (cs.SY) and multi-antenna systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of relays in communication networks (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
