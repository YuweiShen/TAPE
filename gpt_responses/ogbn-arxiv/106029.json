The focus on identity and credential management suggests a stronger connection to cryptography and networking, hence the higher likelihood of cs.CR and cs.NI. However, the paper also touches upon standardization and industry adoption, which may involve software engineering and control systems, as well as cyber security concerns."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
