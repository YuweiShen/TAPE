The use of control-theoretic tools suggests that the paper may also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) category. The paper also involves reasoning about the effect of plan execution, which suggests that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. The use of a 3D limit-cycle gait bipedal robot suggests that the paper may also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) category. Finally, the paper involves generating sequences of primitives, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
