The paper also addresses the issue of frequency asynchrony, which is a common problem in wireless communication networks, and hence, it could be categorized under networked systems (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of space alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm, which is a popular algorithm in machine learning and signal processing, and hence, it could be categorized under multimedia (cs.MM) and computation and language (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
