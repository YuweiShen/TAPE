This makes cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) the most likely category. The paper specifically focuses on IoT devices, which makes cs.IOT (Internet of Things) the second most likely category. The paper also discusses cyberattacks, which makes cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity and Privacy) a likely category. The paper proposes a solution for IoT devices, which makes cs.SE (Software Engineering) a possible category.
