The use of multiple kernels and their fusion is a key aspect of the proposed method, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the use of prediction networks, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves computational efficiency, which is a common topic in graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
