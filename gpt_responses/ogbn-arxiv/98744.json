The focus on the fragility of object recognition in both humans and DNNs suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the accuracy of recognition, which may involve natural language processing (cs.CL) in terms of understanding the language used to describe the results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
