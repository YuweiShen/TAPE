The proposed framework involves the use of deep metric learning, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of spatial features, which are commonly used in image retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM) applications. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV, cs.LG, and cs.AI, followed by cs.IR and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
