The dataset introduced in the paper is focused on outdoor scenes, which suggests that it may also be relevant to graphics (cs.GR). The use of professional haze machines to generate real haze indicates that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM). The paper proposes a new dataset and evaluates state-of-the-art techniques, which suggests that it may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
