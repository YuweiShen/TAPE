The use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) also supports this assumption. The paper also involves machine learning (cs.MM) as it uses a weakly-supervised learning algorithm to project textual attributes at image-level to pixel-level. Additionally, the use of a sparsity-constrained subspace algorithm suggests that this paper may also belong to the machine learning sub-category. The paper may also belong to the sub-categories of information retrieval (cs.IR) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) as it involves image retargeting, aesthetics ranking, and retrieval, which are related to these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
