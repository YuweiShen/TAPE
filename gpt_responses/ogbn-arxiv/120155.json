This involves using an extended Kalman filter to represent the belief space, a neural network in the actor-critic framework to optimize the policy, and a simplified basis for the parameter space. The paper also mentions applying this method to a complex naturalistic task currently used in neuroscience experiments. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY) are also possible sub-categories given the focus on control and planning in robotics and the use of a POMDP framework."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
