The paper proposes a new method based on the Interaction Screening framework that allows for the efficient learning of fully general discrete factor models with node-specific discrete alphabets and multi-body interactions. This is a problem that falls under the category of machine learning, specifically in the area of graphical models. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of learning structured high-dimensional probability distributions, which is also related to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also provides rigorous guarantees on the recovery of model structure and parameters, which is related to the sub-category of cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper proposes a new method that includes all models previously considered in the literature as special cases, which is related to the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
