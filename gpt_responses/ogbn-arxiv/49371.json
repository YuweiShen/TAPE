The paper also discusses the statistical properties of the channels, which is relevant to the field of control systems (cs.SY). The simulators are designed for communication systems, which falls under the category of communication (cs.COMM). Finally, the paper uses Monte Carlo simulations, which is a common technique in the field of machine learning and data analysis (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
