The paper also discusses algorithms and approximation for dense CSPs, which are related to topics in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper uses subsampling techniques, which are often studied in cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
