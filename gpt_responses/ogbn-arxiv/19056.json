The proposed strategy involves deploying a diverse set of safe policies, which can be seen as a robotics (cs.RO) or control systems (cs.SY) problem. The paper also provides theoretical explanations for the effectiveness of diversity in behavior policies, which can be related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
