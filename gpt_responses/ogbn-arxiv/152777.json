Specifically, the paper proposes a general framework for certifying robustness of neural networks with general activation functions, which is a problem that is relevant to several sub-areas of computer science such as machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), and cryptography and security (cs.CR). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.NE, and cs.CR, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
