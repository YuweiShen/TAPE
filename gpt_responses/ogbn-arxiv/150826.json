The proposed method, Pelican, is a deep neural network that incorporates machine learning, which suggests that it could also belong to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions that Pelican is designed to improve the detection performance on novel attacks, which could fall under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates Pelican on two network traffic datasets, which suggests that it could also belong to the category of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
