This suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-category of Computer Science - Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the use of differential privacy, which is a well-known privacy approach used in machine learning and data analysis. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of Computer Science - Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of stylometry and natural language processing, which are sub-fields of computational linguistics.
