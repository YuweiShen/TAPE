It also focuses on Boolean functions, which are a fundamental concept in computer science (cs.DS). The use of Karamata's theorem and probability theory suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of coding theory (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper's focus on transformations of random variables and vectors and algebraic manipulations suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
