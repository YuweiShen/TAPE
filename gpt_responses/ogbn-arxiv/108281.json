This involves computer vision techniques, making cs.CV the most likely category.\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper addresses the issue of privacy invasion by personal drones and proposes a privacy-preserving mechanism to prevent drones from peeking through windows of houses and capturing people doing private things at home. This makes cs.CR a likely category.\n3. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the use of drones for various purposes and proposes a method to prevent drones from invading people's privacy. This involves robotics and makes cs.RO a likely category.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of drones for entertainment, filming, or transporting items from one place to another. This involves multimedia and makes cs.MM a possible category.\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a lightweight privacy-preserving-by-design method that prevents drones from peeking through windows of houses and capturing people doing private things at home. This involves machine learning techniques, making cs.LG a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
