The paper focuses on modeling the relationship among passage, question, and answer options bidirectionally, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper integrates two reading strategies into the model, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques as it deals with finding the most salient supporting sentences to answer the question. Finally, the paper involves neural networks (cs.NE) as it proposes a dual co-matching network for modeling the relationship among passage, question, and answer options."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
