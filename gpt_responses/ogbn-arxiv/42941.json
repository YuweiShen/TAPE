Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is the most likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed activation function on image classification tasks, which falls under cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses the impact of activation functions on training and testing, which is a topic in cs.LG (Machine Learning). Furthermore, the paper compares the proposed activation function with other well-known activations, which is a topic in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
