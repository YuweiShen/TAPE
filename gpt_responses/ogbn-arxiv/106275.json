The codes are also relevant to side-channel attacks (cs.CR) and communication systems (cs.CC). The use of algebraic function fields suggests a connection to algebraic coding theory and algebraic geometry, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.SI and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
