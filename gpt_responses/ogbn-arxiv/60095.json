This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as it deals with protecting the integrity of GNSS signals. The technique involves monitoring power and correlation function distortion, which suggests that it may also fall under the categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), systems and control (cs.SY), software engineering (cs.SE), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
