The paper presents a new logic called Classical BI (CBI) and formulates its model theory and proof theory. The paper also proves some fundamental results about the logic. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Other likely sub-categories include cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SE (Software Engineering), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
