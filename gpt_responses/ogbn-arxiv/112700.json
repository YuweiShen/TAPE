The paper presents new results and generalizations of existing results, which are relevant to several subfields of computer science. Specifically, the paper involves data structures (cs.DS) for nearest neighbor search, computational geometry (cs.CG) for algorithms on the sphere, information theory (cs.IT) for analyzing the tradeoffs between query and update complexities, machine learning (cs.LG) for applications of nearest neighbor search, and systems and control (cs.SY) for optimization of system performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
