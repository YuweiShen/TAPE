The proposed method involves modifying a standard convolutional layer, which is a fundamental component of CNNs, and training it to select important channels for parameter redistribution, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the experimental results involve various datasets, which suggests a potential application in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
