The forecasting is specifically for network resource allocation, which is a subfield of computer networks (cs.NI). The use of deep learning also falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with spatio-temporal variability, which is a topic in spatial information science (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the post-processing of data, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
