The paper also discusses instance-dependent sample complexity, which is a topic commonly studied in the subfield of computational learning theory (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves algorithms and computational complexity, which are relevant to subfields such as cs.AI, cs.DS, and cs.CC. Finally, the paper includes numerical simulations, which could fall under the subfield of computational science (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
