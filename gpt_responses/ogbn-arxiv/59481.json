The approach involves counterexample guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) and reachability analysis, which are techniques commonly used in logic-based approaches to automated synthesis. \n\n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the synthesis of digital feedback controllers for physical plants, which is a core problem in the field of systems and control. The paper presents a sound and automated approach to this problem, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in this field. \n\n3. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper involves the use of CEGIS, which is a programming language-based approach to automated synthesis. The paper also discusses the use of BMC and abstract acceleration, which are techniques commonly used in programming language-based approaches to verification and synthesis. \n\n4. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper deals with the synthesis of digital feedback controllers for physical plants, which is a problem that is relevant to robotics. The paper's approach could potentially be applied to the synthesis of controllers for robotic systems. \n\n5. cs.EM (Emerging Technologies): The paper presents an automated approach to synthesizing digital feedback controllers for physical plants, which is a problem that is relevant to emerging technologies such as"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
