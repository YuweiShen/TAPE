The approach also involves Lie groups, which falls under the category of geometric methods in robotics (cs.LG). The paper mentions various relevant examples in robotics, which suggests that the approach may be applicable to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
