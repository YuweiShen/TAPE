Therefore, cs.IR and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also uses machine learning techniques such as SVM and RVM, which fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of text classification datasets, which could also fall under computer vision (cs.CV) if the datasets include images with text."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
