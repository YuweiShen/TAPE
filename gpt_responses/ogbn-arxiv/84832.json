This is a problem that falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses power allocation and beamforming, which are topics in multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper proposes a practical implementation of the scheme, which involves backhaul links between BTSs, and this falls under the category of computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
