Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a new dataset and evaluation protocol, which involves machine learning algorithms, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely category. The paper also discusses the challenges of weather conditions and proposes solutions, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics and Control). Finally, the paper deals with video processing, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
