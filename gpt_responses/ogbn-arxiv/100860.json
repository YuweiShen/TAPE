Additionally, the paper discusses the use of Conditional Random Field (CRF) and recurrent neural models, which are commonly used in NLP. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of non-linear dense features, which suggests that it could belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Furthermore, the paper discusses the use of globally normalized CRF objective, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n\nThe paper's focus on learning non-linear edge features suggests that it could also belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as this is a common area of research in AI. \n\nThe use of recurrent neural models in the paper suggests that it could belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), which deals with neural networks and their applications. \n\nFinally, the paper's mention of experiments involving image segmentation suggests that it could also belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision), which deals with image processing and computer vision."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
