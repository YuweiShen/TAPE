The use of vector-valued functions and sublevel sets suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational topology (cs.DM) and computational algebraic topology (cs.SI). The algorithmic nature of the paper suggests that it may also be relevant to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
