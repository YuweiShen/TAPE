This falls under the domain of programming languages.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses features that allow the user to modify the interface of the data structure, which is a software engineering concern.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper mentions a rewrite system and maintaining data in canonical form, which are concepts related to logic in computer science.\n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper deals with abstract syntax trees, which are a fundamental concept in formal languages and automata theory.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the internal representation of data and maintaining it in canonical form, which are topics related to data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
