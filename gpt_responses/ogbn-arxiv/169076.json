The paper proposes a hierarchical POMDP planner that optimizes motion plans for hybrid dynamics models, which involves dealing with uncertainty and nonlinear dynamics, making it likely to fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of local dynamics models to model sudden discontinuities in dynamics, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed planner on a navigation task in the simulated domain and an assembly task with a robotic manipulator, which could involve computer vision (cs.CV) techniques for perception and localization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
