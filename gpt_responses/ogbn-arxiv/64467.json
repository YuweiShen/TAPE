The paper specifically focuses on gradient-based methods, which are a popular approach in the field of deep learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also deals with partially observable environments and non-deterministic actions, which are common in control systems, so cs.SY (Systems and Control) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes modified policy-gradient algorithms, which are a type of neural network, so cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
