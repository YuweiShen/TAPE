It also touches on the concept of conditional independence, which is relevant to cryptography and security (cs.CR) as well as information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper proposes a formalization using Pointwise Circumscription, which is a logical reasoning technique that falls under the sub-category of symbolic AI (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
