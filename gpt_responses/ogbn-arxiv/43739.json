This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the proposed method involves training CNNs with randomly transformed feature maps, which involves learning a more robust mapping from input images to transform-invariant representations. This involves optimization and machine learning techniques, which fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also evaluates the proposed method on image retrieval tasks, which falls under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with image recognition tasks, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
