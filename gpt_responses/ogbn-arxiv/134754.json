The paper proposes a new algorithm for MORL that enables few-shot adaptation to new tasks. The paper also discusses the challenges of learning a single model to produce optimal policies under different preference conditions. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
