The proposed method involves learning transformations that map images to a latent space, which is a common approach in deep learning and generative models (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of these transformations to create new images that can be considered two successive frames in a video, which relates to graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
