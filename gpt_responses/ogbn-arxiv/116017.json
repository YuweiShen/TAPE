This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and network infrastructure (cs.NI), as well as system engineering (cs.SY) and radio frequency (cs.RF). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of large antenna arrays in massive MIMO and millimeter wave communication, which are both areas of active research in computer science (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
