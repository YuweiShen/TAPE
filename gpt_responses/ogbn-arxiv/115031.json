This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. The method involves learning to map input pairs to a feature space where intra-class inputs are close and inter-class inputs are separated by a margin, which is a metric learning problem (cs.AI, cs.IR). Finally, the experiments involve evaluating the classification performance on remote sensing image datasets, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
