It also uses concepts from ergodic theory, which is a subfield of dynamical systems (cs.DS). The paper discusses the polarization of binary operations, which can be seen as a type of data structure (cs.DS). It also studies the polarization of multiple access channels, which is a topic in networking (cs.SI, cs.NA). Finally, the paper discusses the rate of polarization, which can be seen as a type of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
