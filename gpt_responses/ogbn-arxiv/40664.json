The paper proposes an MPC-based protocol for AVs along with a coordination protocol for traffic lights. This work involves robotics (cs.RO) as it deals with the coordination of autonomous vehicles. It also involves systems and control (cs.SY) as it proposes a control protocol for AVs. Additionally, it involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it proposes an MPC-based protocol for AVs. The paper also discusses safety and security issues related to autonomous vehicles, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a model predictive controller for AVs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
