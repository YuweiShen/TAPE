The use of cognitive language processing signals such as gaze and EEG features also suggests a potential fit for the sub-category of cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The paper also involves the use of machine learning models, indicating a possible fit for the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper explores the potential of using human language processing data for NLP, which could fall under the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
