The paper also proposes a novel approach to refine keypoint detection heatmaps and improve structural consistency of keypoints, which involves the use of regression networks, making it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses a global regression to optimize pose inference, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
