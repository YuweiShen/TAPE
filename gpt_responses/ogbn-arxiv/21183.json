The paper also mentions the use of preprocessing and encoding techniques for tackling large-scale instances, which are common in the subfield of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The use of heuristics and approximations to boost performance is also mentioned, which is relevant to the subfield of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with scheduling and optimization, which are relevant to the subfield of Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper is being considered for publication in the journal Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), which is a subfield of Programming Languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
