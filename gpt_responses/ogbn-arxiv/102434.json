The paper specifically focuses on Transfer Learning, which is a technique used to address this challenge. Transfer Learning is a subfield of machine learning and is closely related to deep learning, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. \n\nThe paper also discusses experiments conducted on image datasets, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the importance of hyperparameters in deep learning, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of neural networks, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses image classification tasks, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
