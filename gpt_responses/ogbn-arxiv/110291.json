This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of swarm intelligence and optimization techniques also suggests the sub-category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). The paper also evaluates the proposed approach using benchmark datasets, indicating the sub-category of data mining (cs.DM). Finally, the use of feature selection in classification tasks suggests the sub-category of computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
