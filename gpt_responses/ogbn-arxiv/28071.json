The paper discusses new problem formulations for the cases of multiset estimates of items, which is a topic related to data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.CC). The paper also suggests a new systemic viewpoint to bin packing problems, which involves binary relations and can be seen as a form of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper provides applied examples of bin packing problems, including a communication system, which is related to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
