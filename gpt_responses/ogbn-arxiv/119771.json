The use of adversarial non-zero sum games and entropy as a measure of information content suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Finally, the datasets used in the numerical experiments (UCI, Extended Yale B, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
