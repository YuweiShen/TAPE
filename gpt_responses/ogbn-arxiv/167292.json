Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a method to estimate camera pose jointly with human pose, which involves robotics and control, making cs.RO (Robotics) a likely category as well. The use of deep learning techniques and large datasets also suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) is a possible category. The paper also mentions a new Ski dataset, which involves motion capture and could be categorized under cs.GR (Graphics) or cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
