The paper proposes a new model that combines two popular approaches in object detection, namely Deformable Parts Models (DPMs) and Convolutional Networks (ConvNets), and trains the model in an end-to-end fashion. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of a structured loss function, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
