The paper also presents a unified framework for quantifying position-related information, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The use of geometric-stochastic channel models and analytical results for the Cramer-Rao lower bound suggest a focus on robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
