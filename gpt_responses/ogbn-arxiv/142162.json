The use of DNNs suggests that it could belong to cs.AR (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The focus on energy efficiency and low power design suggests it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.ET (Embedded Systems). Finally, the use of statistical sampling and gate-level timing simulations suggests it could belong to cs.DC (Digital Circuits)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
