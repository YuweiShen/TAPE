It is also likely to belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as it conducts experiments on standard datasets including ImageNet. Additionally, it may belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as QNNs are a popular research topic in the field of AI. It may also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it deals with neural networks and their optimization. Finally, it may belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as it introduces computationally cheaper approximations of percentiles to reduce the computation overhead introduced."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
