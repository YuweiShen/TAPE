The paper also evaluates the proposed method on a wide range of model-datasets, which is a common practice in machine learning research. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of DNNs in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) applications, indicating that the proposed method may be applicable in these sub-categories as well. Additionally, the paper discusses the importance of uncertainty estimation in decision making (cs.AI) and the use of ensembles (cs.NE) as a comparison method, suggesting that these sub-categories may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
