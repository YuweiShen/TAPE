The codes are defined over a finite field, which is a common setting in cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the optimality of the codes and their use in secret sharing schemes, which are topics in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper uses exponential sums, which are a tool in algebraic geometry and number theory, making category cs.GT a possibility as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
