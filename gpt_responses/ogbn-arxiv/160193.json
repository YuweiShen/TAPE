The paper also discusses probabilistic logic programming, which falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL). The paper's focus on many-valued logic and intensional FOL suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and mathematical software (cs.MS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
