The proposed method involves tensor factorization, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The method also involves reducing the memory requirement, which is a common concern in database systems (cs.DB). The task of knowledge graph completion involves natural language processing and semantic understanding, which are also relevant to computational linguistics (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
