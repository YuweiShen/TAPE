It also mentions the use of pseudorandom number generators and cryptographic keys, which are topics related to cryptography (cs.CR). The use of tables and automata in the proposed method suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS). The comparison with Huffman and arithmetic coding suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the mention of large alphabet range coding suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
