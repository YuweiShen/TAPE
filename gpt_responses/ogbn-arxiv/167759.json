The use of energy detection and the comparison to dirty paper coding suggest a possible connection to signal processing and information retrieval (cs.SI). The later part of the paper deals with capacity per unit cost for a general discrete channel, which could fall under the data structures (cs.DS) or multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
