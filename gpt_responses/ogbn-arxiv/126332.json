The paper proposes a novel loss function for feature discrimination, which is a core problem in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves designing a new loss function, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments are conducted on face recognition benchmarks, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves adapting the loss function to emphasize mis-classified points, which is a common topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
