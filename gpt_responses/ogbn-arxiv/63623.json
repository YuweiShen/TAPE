The paper proposes a unified framework based on structured prediction and infimum loss to deal with partial labelling over a wide family of learning problems and loss functions. This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The paper also mentions experiments related to classification, ranking, and segmentation, which are common tasks in Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper provides algorithms with statistical consistency and learning rates, which suggests that it could also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
