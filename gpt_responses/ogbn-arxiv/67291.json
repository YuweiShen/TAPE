The paper also uses concepts from Learning Theory (cs.LG) to develop a new notion of data privacy. Additionally, the paper discusses algorithms for releasing synthetic data for specific classes of queries, which involves concepts from Data Structures (cs.DS) and Databases (cs.DB). Finally, the paper also discusses the error guarantees of these algorithms, which involves concepts from Information Theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
