This falls under the category of natural language processing and computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also involves binary classification of authors, which could fall under the categories of cryptography and security (cs.CR), information retrieval (cs.IR), and social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the use of machine learning and deep learning models suggests a possible connection to the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
