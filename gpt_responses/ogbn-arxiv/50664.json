The paper discusses the detection of channels in coded communication, which is a topic that falls under the sub-categories of information theory (cs.IT), communication (cs.COMM), and statistical learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses achievable bounds on error exponents, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of sub-optimal detection/decoding rules, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
