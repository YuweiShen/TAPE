The paper also discusses the design of an encoder-decoder architecture to generate binary codes for videos, which is a common topic in computer vision. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper focuses on the task of unsupervised video retrieval, which is a central problem in multimedia. The proposed method is evaluated on two real-world datasets, which further supports the relevance to this sub-category. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a hierarchical binary auto-encoder to model the temporal dependencies in videos with multiple granularities, which is a machine learning technique. The paper also discusses the use of end-to-end learning to hash fashion, which is a common topic in machine learning. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper focuses on the task of unsupervised video retrieval, which is a central problem in information retrieval. The proposed method aims to equip the binary codes with the ability of accurate video retrieval. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): Although the paper does not explicitly discuss natural language processing, the proposed method involves the use of an encoder-decoder architecture, which is a common technique in natural language processing.
