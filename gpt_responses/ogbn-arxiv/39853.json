The paper also mentions graph theory and probability theory, which are relevant to distributed systems (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper discusses various applications of fountain codes, which could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
