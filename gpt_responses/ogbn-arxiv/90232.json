The use of structured operators such as Fourier and Hadamard ones suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SP). The mention of spatially coupled operators and their efficient reconstruction in compressed sensing suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.MM) or learning (cs.LG). Finally, the mention of sparse superposition codes suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR) or social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
