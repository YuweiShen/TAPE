Additionally, the paper mentions GPU support and backpropagation, which are common in deep learning, further supporting the cs.LG category. The paper also mentions algorithmic improvements, which could suggest a category such as cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The library's compatibility with the PyTorch ecosystem suggests a category such as cs.CV (Computer Vision) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the library's use of C++ and Python suggests a category such as cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
