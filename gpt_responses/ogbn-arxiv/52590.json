The paper also involves the use of computer vision techniques for estimating the relative position and velocity of the quadcopter and the landing pad, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also involves the design of a controller for the full rendezvous and landing maneuvers, which could fall under control systems (cs.SY). The paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques for the estimation of the relative position and velocity, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
