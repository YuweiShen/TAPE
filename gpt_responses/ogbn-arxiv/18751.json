This involves learning and parsing the object appearance and structure variations, as well as handling distractors in the background. These tasks are formulated in the Bayesian framework with dynamic programming algorithms. The paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category, as it deals with object tracking in video sequences and image analysis. It may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories, as it involves learning and inference tasks. The Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category is also a possibility, as object tracking is a relevant task in robotics. Finally, the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category may be relevant, as the paper deals with video sequences."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
