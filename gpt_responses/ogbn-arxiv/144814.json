The use of communication schedules and sampling-based motion planning suggests a focus on multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and control systems (cs.SY). The problem of intermittent communication also involves networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the use of optimization techniques for decision-making suggests a possible connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
