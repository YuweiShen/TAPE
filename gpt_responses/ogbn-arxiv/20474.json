This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR), which is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in the state-of-the-art malware mitigation solutions, which could be another possible sub-category. The fact that the malware targets IoT devices that rely on the internet to function properly suggests that the paper could also belong to the sub-categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the use of graph theory techniques to analyze the malware samples could also place the paper under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
