The paper specifically focuses on the reliability and robustness of deep neural network watermarking techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The watermarking techniques are applied to image data, which suggests that the paper may also fall under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the computational resources required for deep neural networks, which could place it under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the concept of intellectual property, which is a topic commonly discussed in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
