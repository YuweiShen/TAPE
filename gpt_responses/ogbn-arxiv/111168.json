The paper also discusses the relaxation of constraints on c-planarity, which involves studying the structure of the graph and its underlying planarity, making it relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also mentions the typical application contexts of graph drawing, which could fall under social and information networks (cs.SI) and graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
