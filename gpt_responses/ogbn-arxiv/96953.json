The paper also presents a new Tor guard relay selection algorithm, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) as it involves selecting the most resilient relays. The paper also discusses the resilience of ASes with high Tor bandwidth, which falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents a live BGP monitoring system, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CY) as it involves detecting routing anomalies and attacks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
