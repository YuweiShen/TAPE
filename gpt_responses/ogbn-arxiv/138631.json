The paper provides a rigorous justification for using stationary equilibrium (SE) as a solution concept and draws a significant connection between the validity of SE and market structure. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are Game Theory (cs.GT), Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Economics (cs.EC), and Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
