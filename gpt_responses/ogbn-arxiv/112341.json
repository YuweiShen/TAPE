This topic falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC) and database systems (cs.DB). The paper also addresses the issue of malicious primaries affecting system throughput, which is a concern in the field of computer security (cs.CR). The proposed approach involves running several instances of the underlying BFT protocol in parallel, which relates to the sub-category of distributed systems (cs.Distributed). Finally, the paper discusses the achieved throughput of the proposed approach, which is a performance metric relevant to networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
