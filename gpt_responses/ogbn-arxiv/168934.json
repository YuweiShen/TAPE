The paper also discusses algorithms for finding induced subgraphs, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper's focus on moderate exponential algorithms suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-field of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
