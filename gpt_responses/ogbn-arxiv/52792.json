Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of small-scale changes in the position and orientation of the antenna of each RF sensor affecting imaging and localization performance, which is a common problem in wireless networks. \n\nThe paper is also likely to belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.RO (Robotics) because it presents a system of servo-nodes, RF sensors equipped with servo motors, which autonomously change position and orientation to optimize the RSS on links of the network. This system can be seen as a type of robot that is designed to improve the performance of the RTI system. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.IT (Information Theory) because it involves the use of received signal strength (RSS) measurements to localize people in the deployment area. Information theory is concerned with the transmission, processing, and utilization of information, and the use of RSS measurements can be seen as a form of information processing. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control) because it presents a system of servo-nodes that is designed to optimize"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
