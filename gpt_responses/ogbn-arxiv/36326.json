The paper presents a vision-guided needle grasping method for automatically grasping the needle that has been inserted into the patient prior to anastomosis. This involves computer vision (cs.CV) for needle detection and path planning based on observed surgical practice, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of surgical tools and instruments, which could fall under robotics (cs.RO) and mechanical engineering (cs.ME). Additionally, the paper includes experimental results that involve visual feedback, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
