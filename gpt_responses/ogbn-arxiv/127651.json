Additionally, the paper mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Network features, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of semantic priors, which are a form of prior knowledge that can be used to improve the performance of machine learning models. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. \n\nThe paper's iterative multistage optimization scheme and the use of $L_2$ smoothing and $L_1$ sparsity suggest that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. \n\nThe paper's focus on analyzing images at three hierarchical context levels suggests that it could also belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) category, which deals with the creation, manipulation, and rendering of images. \n\nFinally, the paper's use of selective search method and its comparison with other contemporary IID solutions suggest that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category, which deals with the processing and analysis of multimedia data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
