This falls under the scope of computer vision.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed method deals with face images and videos, which are multimedia data. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper addresses the problem of face anti-spoofing, which is a security concern in face recognition systems. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a CNN for liveness classification and regression, which is a machine learning technique. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The proposed method is designed for real-world systems serving millions of users, which involves human-computer interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
