The paper discusses the use of convolutional neural networks and auxiliary information to improve recognition accuracy, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of natural language models, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of scientific taxonomy, which falls under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category.
