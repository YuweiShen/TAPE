This falls under the scope of database systems. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of predictive and prescriptive analytics techniques, which are commonly used in AI applications. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new data model called Many-Worlds Graphs, which combines graphs and time series. This falls under the scope of data structures. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of predictive analytics techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning applications. \n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents an open source implementation called GreyCat, which can efficiently fork and update thousands of parallel worlds composed of millions of timestamped nodes.
