Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also proposes a new precoding paradigm that involves changing the analog and digital precoders at the symbol rate, which requires sophisticated signal processing techniques. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Moreover, the paper deals with the problem of optimizing the analog and digital precoders, which is a key issue in MIMO systems, and this could place the paper in the categories of cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
