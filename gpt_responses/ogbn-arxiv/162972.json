The method involves training deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to map raw image observations to torques at the robot's motors, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to train the policies, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the method on real-world manipulation tasks, which involves control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
