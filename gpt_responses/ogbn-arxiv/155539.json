The paper specifically focuses on the Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) method and its scalability to large batch sizes. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper also discusses hyperparameter tuning and sensitivity, which could fall under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
