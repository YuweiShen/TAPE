The proposed framework involves the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN), which is a popular machine learning technique (cs.LG). The framework also involves the use of multi-instance learning, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.AI). The experiments involve benchmark datasets, which are commonly used in multimedia research (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also involves the use of labels to improve recognition performance, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
