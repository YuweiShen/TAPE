Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the complex model of the system, which involves signal processing and communication theory, making cs.COMM (Communications) another likely category. The paper proposes a reduced-complexity algorithm, which involves optimization techniques, making cs.SI (Systems and Control) another possible category. The paper also deals with the noise at the output, which involves signal processing and networking, making cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) another possible category. Finally, the paper discusses the numerical results of the proposed algorithm, which involves statistical analysis and machine learning, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
