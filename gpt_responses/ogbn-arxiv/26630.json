The paper also discusses methods for improving the accuracy of a classifier, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG), and uses feature selection by mutual information, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also mentions the use of n-grams, which is a common technique in both NLP and machine learning. Therefore, it could also be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
