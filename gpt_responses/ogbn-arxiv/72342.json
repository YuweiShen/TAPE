The use of a pre-trained VGG-based deep face recognition network for feature extraction suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG). The focus on identity preservation in face super-resolution also suggests that the paper may be relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
