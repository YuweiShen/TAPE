It also involves the use of intersection and union types, which are topics in logic (cs.LO) and type theory (cs.TL). The paper also discusses the interpretation of types as sets of functions, which is a topic in functional analysis (cs.FL). Finally, the paper presents a condition for type isomorphism based on reduction, which is a topic in computer science theory (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
