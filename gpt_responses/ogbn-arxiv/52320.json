It also involves the use of neural models and attention mechanisms, which are commonly used in NLP research. Additionally, the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) due to the use of neural models and classifiers. Information Retrieval (cs.IR) may also be a relevant sub-category as the paper deals with efficiently classifying spoken language utterances into specific domains. Finally, System and Control (cs.SD) may be a possible sub-category as the paper discusses practical constraints in real-time production systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
