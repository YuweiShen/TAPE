The paper specifically focuses on the effects of quantization on various reinforcement learning tasks and algorithms, which falls under the purview of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The tasks involve visual inputs, such as Pong and Breakout, which are processed using computer vision techniques. The deployment of quantized policies on embedded systems also involves aspects of robotics and control systems. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.CV, followed by cs.RO and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
