The use of hierarchies to organize the domains of each dimension is also a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) applications. Finally, the paper proposes a new data structure that is more efficient than existing multidimensional structures, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and optimization (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
