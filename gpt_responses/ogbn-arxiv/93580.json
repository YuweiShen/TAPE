The authors also discuss the use of consistency constraints to improve the accuracy of the output, which is a topic in cryptography and security (cs.CR). The techniques proposed in the paper involve computing the degree sequence of a graph and computing a histogram that can support arbitrary range queries accurately, which are problems in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also involves theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation of the proposed techniques, which are topics in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
