The paper also involves machine learning techniques for feature selection and incremental learning, which makes it likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of mid-level semantic features and the evaluation of the model on a benchmark dataset suggests that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the incorporation of the model into an online tracking-by-detection framework makes it relevant to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
