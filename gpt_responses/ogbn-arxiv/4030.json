Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the transmission of information via multiple agents, which falls under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia). The presence of a passive eavesdropper and the need for secrecy constraints suggest the sub-categories of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
