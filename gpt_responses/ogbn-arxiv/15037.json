The paper also discusses the achievable exponents for type I and type II error probabilities, which is related to statistical inference (cs.SI). The use of mixed memoryless sources suggests a possible connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper's discussion of generalizing the results to more general settings suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
