The use of decision trees as an interpretable surrogate model is also a well-established technique. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions the use of regularization techniques, which are commonly used in optimization problems in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve image classification tasks, which fall under the sub-category of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also deals with the complexity of models, which is a topic in neural engineering (cs.NE). Finally, the use of decision trees is a topic in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
