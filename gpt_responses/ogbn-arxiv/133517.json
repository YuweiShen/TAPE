The method is based on data locality and domain-specific models, which are also relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The proposed method is evaluated on an object detection benchmark, which involves natural language processing (cs.CL) for labeling and annotation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
