It also involves compressing the network model, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of vector quantization methods is related to neural networks and optimization, which could also place this paper in the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on compressing deep networks for resource-limited hardware could also relate to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
