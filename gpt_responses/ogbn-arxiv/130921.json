The use of millimeter waves also suggests a potential connection to multimedia (MM) and systems and control (SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the integration of the model into ns-3, a network simulator, which could be relevant to the area of architecture (AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
