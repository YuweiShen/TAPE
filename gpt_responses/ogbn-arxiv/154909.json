This makes it highly likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. However, the paper also involves optimization problems and efficient solver algorithms, which suggests it could also belong to the information theory (cs.IT), multimedia (cs.MM), numerical analysis (cs.NA), or signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
