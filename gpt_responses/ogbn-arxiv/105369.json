Additionally, the paper mentions the use of data augmentation, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The regularization technique proposed in the paper can also be applied to various types of DNNs, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
