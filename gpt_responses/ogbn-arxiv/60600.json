The problem of deciding whether a simple non-self-intersecting wire structure can be straightened is a problem in discrete geometry (cs.DM) and the variant of the problem with a restriction that only one joint can be modified at a time is a problem in discrete structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the manufacturing process, which is related to operations research (cs.RO) and the use of efficient algorithms, which is related to computer science and mathematics (cs.MS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
