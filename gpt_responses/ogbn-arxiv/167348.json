The use of machine learning algorithms for automatic identification of building locations and grouping of cities and countries based on architectural styles suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the quantitative analysis of architecture, which could be categorized under computer graphics (cs.GR). The use of Google StreetView images implies the involvement of multimedia (cs.MM) and the use of machine learning algorithms suggests the involvement of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
