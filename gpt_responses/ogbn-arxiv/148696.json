The use of Fourier measurements and convex priors suggests a connection to signal processing and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the use of Fienup methods in image reconstruction, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The theoretical analysis of the algorithm and the use of regularization and optimization techniques suggest a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the experimental results and the use of sparsity priors suggest a connection to signal processing and statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
