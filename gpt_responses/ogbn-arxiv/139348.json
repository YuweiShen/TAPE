The paper focuses on the design of interleavers for this architecture, which guarantee clash-free memory accesses to eliminate idle operational cycles, optimize spread and dispersion to improve network performance, and are designed to ease the complexity of memory address computations in hardware. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also involves the analysis of the behavior of neural networks, which suggests that it could belong to cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper involves the application of the proposed architecture to computer vision tasks, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
