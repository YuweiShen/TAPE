The primary focus is on computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML) techniques for face recognition. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of deep learning techniques, which falls under the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of unsupervised learning, which falls under the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of video frames, which falls under the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the use of face recognition in surveillance scenarios, which falls under the sub-category cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
