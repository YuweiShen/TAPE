The paper examines the role of sparsity as a regularizing principle and presents a fast single-pass linear algorithm for $\\ell_1$ minimization. The paper also discusses the placement of lossy links within trees and shows that sparse solutions remain unique more often than is commonly supposed. Based on these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
