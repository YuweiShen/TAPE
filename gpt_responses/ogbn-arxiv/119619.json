The paper also discusses the use of novel switch hardware for in-order flow deflection (cs.AR) and proposes a new approach to congestion control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper evaluates its approach through simulations and testbed measurements (cs.PF) and focuses on improving performance in datacenter networks (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
