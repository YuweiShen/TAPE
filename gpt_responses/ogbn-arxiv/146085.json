The use of team semantics and bisimulation equivalence also suggests a connection to formal methods and verification (cs.FL). However, given the focus on modal logic and its extensions, as well as the technical nature of the paper, we believe that cs.LO and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.LG, cs.PL, and cs.CC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
