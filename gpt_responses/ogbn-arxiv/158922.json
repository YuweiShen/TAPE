The paper also mentions bounds on the size of a full conjunctive query, which is related to data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of Shearer's entropy inequality suggests that information theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant. Finally, the discussion of geometric inequalities implies that computational geometry (cs.CG) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
