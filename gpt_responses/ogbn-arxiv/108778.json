The methodology proposed involves semantic information extraction from images to create a fast-forward video that is more visually appealing. This work is likely to fall under the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): This sub-category deals with the analysis and processing of visual data, including images and videos. The use of semantic information extraction to create a fast-forward video aligns with the scope of this sub-category. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): This sub-category deals with the creation, processing, and analysis of multimedia content, including videos. The focus of this paper on creating a more visually appealing video is relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the development and application of machine learning algorithms. The use of semantic information extraction to select frames for the fast-forward video may involve machine learning techniques, making this sub-category relevant. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category deals with the retrieval and analysis of information from large datasets. The use of semantic information extraction to select frames for the fast-forward video may involve information retrieval techniques, making this sub-category relevant. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): This sub-category deals with the design and evaluation of interactive systems involving humans and computers.
