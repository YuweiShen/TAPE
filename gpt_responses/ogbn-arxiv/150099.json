This involves learning a transformation from CSI to a near-optimal number of representations (codewords) and an inverse transformation from codewords to CSI. This problem is related to several areas of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), signal processing (cs.SI), and wireless communications (cs.MM). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT, cs.LG, cs.NE, cs.SI, and cs.MM, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
