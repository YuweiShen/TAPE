This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of temporal signature-based location distinction, which could fall under the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) or Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the reliability of MIMO location distinction, which could relate to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
