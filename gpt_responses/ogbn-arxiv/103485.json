The focus of the paper is on reducing the complexity of Multiply Accumulate (MAC) units, which are a key component of CNN accelerators. This topic is relevant to the sub-category of hardware architecture for neural networks (cs.AR). The paper also discusses the use of weight sharing to reduce memory traffic in CNNs, which is a technique commonly used in low power and embedded systems (cs.ET). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel MAC circuit that exploits binning, which is a technique used in neural network compression (cs.NE). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on gate count and power consumption, which are relevant to the sub-category of embedded systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
