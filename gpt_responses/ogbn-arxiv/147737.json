The use of weakly supervised learning is also a key aspect of the paper, which falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of the method to aerial and satellite images suggests that it could also be relevant to the field of geographic information systems (cs.GR). Finally, the proposed adaptation of the AffinityNet could be of interest to the robotics community (cs.RO) as it allows for direct semantic segmentation without the need for additional post-processing steps."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
