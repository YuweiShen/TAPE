The algorithm is tested on two real-world engineering applications in Electroencephalogram feature learning and Distributed Generator parameter tuning. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories such as Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Software Engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
