The paper proposes an estimation framework to assess the performance of sorting over perturbed/noisy data, which involves the use of various information-theoretic concepts such as Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), Bayesian Cram\\'er-Rao bound, and maximum entropy bound. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes various suboptimal estimators for the problem of estimating order statistics over perturbed/noisy data, which can be seen as a machine learning problem. The paper also discusses the performance guarantees of these suboptimal estimators with respect to the optimal estimator. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The problem of estimating order statistics over perturbed/noisy data involves the use of various data structures and algorithms such as sorting, linear combination, and optimization. The paper proposes an estimation framework that involves the use of these data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The problem of estimating order statistics over perturbed/noisy data is relevant in various social and information networks such as recommender systems, collaborative filtering, and ranking. The paper proposes an estimation framework that can be applied to these networks. \n5."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
