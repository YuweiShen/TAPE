The paper also considers multiple-access MIMO channels, which is a topic of interest in networked systems (cs.NI). The use of cooperating Base Station clusters also suggests a focus on networked systems. The paper also employs numerical methods to verify the accuracy of the derived expressions, which falls under the domain of scientific computing (cs.SI). The use of asymptotic free probability approach suggests a focus on mathematical modeling and analysis (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with impairments in the channel, which suggests a focus on data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
