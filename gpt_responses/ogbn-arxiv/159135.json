The authors use a RankSVM formulation to solve the learning to rank problem, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of features to capture temporal interactions in an approximate plan, which is related to robotics (cs.RO) and planning (cs.PL). Finally, the authors mention experiments on image-based planning problems, which could be related to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
