This involves adapting an energy minimizing active contour method designed for robust mesh processing. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.GR (Computer Graphics), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The paper also mentions tracking contours as the mesh animates, which suggests a possible connection to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
