The experiments focus on image recognition and person re-identification tasks, which are typically studied in computer vision (cs.CV) research. The paper also discusses the architecture of the networks used, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of natural language processing techniques for data augmentation, which is a topic in computational linguistics (cs.CL).
