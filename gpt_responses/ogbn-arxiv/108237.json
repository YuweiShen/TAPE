This problem is related to several areas of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), and computational complexity (cs.CC). However, given the focus on optimization and submodularity, we believe that cs.DS and cs.AI are the most likely categories, followed by cs.LG, cs.IT, and cs.CC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
