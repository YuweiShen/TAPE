This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The method involves growing new layers in a network and evaluating their impact on accuracy, which is a machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE) topic. The paper also proposes generic growing and stopping policies, which is a form of algorithm design and optimization, falling under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the method on various datasets, which involves natural language processing (cs.CL) for some of the datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
