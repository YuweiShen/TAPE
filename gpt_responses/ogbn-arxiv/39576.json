Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the generative mechanisms of the TextWorld library, which can be used to relax challenges inherent to commercial text games like partial observability and sparse rewards. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Game Theory (cs.GT) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the development of benchmark games and the evaluation of several baseline agents, indicating that it may also belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
