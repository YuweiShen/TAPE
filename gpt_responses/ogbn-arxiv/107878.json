The paper also discusses the number of bins required for efficient communication, which is a key concept in information theory. \n2. cs.GT (Game Theory) - The paper analyzes the equilibrium behavior of a signaling game between two decision makers, which is a classic problem in game theory. The paper also discusses the misalignment in the objective functions of the decision makers, which is a key concept in game theory. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper discusses the problem of learning in a decentralized setting, which is a key concept in machine learning. The paper also discusses the equilibrium behavior of the decision makers, which is a key concept in reinforcement learning. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper discusses the problem of communication between two decision makers, which is a key concept in multi-agent systems and artificial intelligence. The paper also discusses the equilibrium behavior of the decision makers, which is a key concept in game theory and decision theory. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper discusses the problem of communication between two decision makers in a decentralized setting, which is a key concept in social and information networks.
