The paper presents new upper and lower bound results for both insertion-only streams and dynamic streams. The problem is related to several subfields of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational complexity (cs.CC), information theory (cs.IT), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
