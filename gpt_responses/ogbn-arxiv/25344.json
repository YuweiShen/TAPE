The paper also discusses the underlying logic in formulas and introduces a new variant of short-circuit logic. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the evaluation of program instructions and defines side effects in deterministic programs. It also gives rules for composing side effects in single instructions. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses side effects in programs and introduces a classification of side effects, including the important class of marginal side effects. It also shows how to use the system for calculating side effects in a real system. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper introduces a new logic system, DLAf, and discusses the underlying logic in formulas. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): While not the main focus of the paper, the discussion of side effects in programs could be relevant to security and vulnerability analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
