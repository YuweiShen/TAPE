The use of MIMO technology in both radar and cellular systems also suggests a strong connection to information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the coexistence of radar and cellular systems, which involves networking and communication between different systems. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper addresses the problem of target detection in a complex system involving multiple radars and base stations, which can be viewed as a control problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper involves the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology, which is commonly used in multimedia communication systems. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): While not a primary focus of the paper, the issue of interference mitigation in wireless communication systems can have implications for security and cryptography."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
