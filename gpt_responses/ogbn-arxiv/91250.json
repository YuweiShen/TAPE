This task involves visual-textual association, which is a core issue in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper proposes a novel approach that involves attention mechanisms, which are commonly used in both computer vision and natural language processing. The paper also addresses the problem of negative pair mining, which is a common issue in machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on a person search dataset (cs.CV) and a caption dataset (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
