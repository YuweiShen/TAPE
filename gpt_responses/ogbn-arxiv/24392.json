Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning models, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper includes open source code for extracting features from binaries, which could place it in cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper mentions benchmark datasets advancing computer vision research, which could indicate a connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
