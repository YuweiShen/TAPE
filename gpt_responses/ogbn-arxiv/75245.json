Therefore, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions semantic indexing and visualization, which are related to digital libraries (cs.DL) and cybersecurity (cs.CY), respectively. Additionally, the paper may fall under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI) due to the discussion of how information is created, stored, and used.
