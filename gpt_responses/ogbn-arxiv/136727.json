This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. The method also involves using a statistical shape model and enforcing geometry through a differentiable geometric transformation, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
