The use of KPIs extracted from the O&M database of the network suggests that this paper may also be related to information theory (cs.IT) and security and cryptography (cs.CR). The proposed technique for hotspot localization can also be considered as a solution for network optimization, which falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of coverage maps and throughput metrics, which suggests that it may also be related to multimedia (cs.MM) in terms of network traffic management for multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
