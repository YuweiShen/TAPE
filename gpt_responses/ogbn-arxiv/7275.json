The use of preference relations and the study of strategies also indicate a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The focus on graph structures and the use of algorithms to find equilibria suggest a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
