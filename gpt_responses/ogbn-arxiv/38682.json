This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The method is based on Fourier descriptors and an SVM classifier, which suggests that it may also belong to the neural networks (cs.NE), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with the issue of noise in object recognition, which suggests that it may also belong to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
