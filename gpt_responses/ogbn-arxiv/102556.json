Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and deep learning (cs.DL) sub-categories. Among these, cs.CV and cs.LG are the most likely categories as they are directly related to the proposed approach and the evaluated tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
