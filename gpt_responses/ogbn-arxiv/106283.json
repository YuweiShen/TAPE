It also provides theoretical insights and experimental results to support its claims. Additionally, the paper may also fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) as these fields heavily rely on machine learning techniques. The paper's focus on optimization problems may also make it relevant to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) category. Finally, the paper's mention of parallelization and variance-reduced SG methods may make it relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
