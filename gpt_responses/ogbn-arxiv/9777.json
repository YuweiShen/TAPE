This category is the most likely fit for this paper.\n2. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper discusses the cost of operating SBC-based clusters by correlating energy utilization for the execution time of various benchmarks using workloads of different sizes. This category is also a likely fit as it deals with the computational aspects of engineering and science.\n3. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) - The paper utilizes Single Board Computers (SBCs) for building clusters, which falls under the hardware architecture domain. This category is a possible fit.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper evaluates the network throughput of the SBC-based clusters, which falls under the networking domain. This category is also a possible fit.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the effectiveness of SBC-based clusters as a testbed for inexpensive and green cloud computing research, which falls under the systems and control domain. This category is a less likely fit but still possible."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
