The paper also discusses the design of distance-generating functions, which is related to optimization (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of practical tuning and comparison with other algorithms suggests a focus on experimental results and implementation (cs.DS). Finally, the mention of acceleration and convergence rates suggests a possible connection to control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
