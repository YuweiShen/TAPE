The paper also discusses the low-rank structure of the Jacobian matrix, which is a common topic in neural network optimization (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions experiments with deep networks, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of structured and noisy datasets on training and generalization, which is relevant to data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
