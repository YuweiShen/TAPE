The study collects data on face-to-face interactions, telecommunication, social networks, location, and background information using state-of-the-art smartphones as social sensors. The paper discusses the technical infrastructure in terms of both backend and phone software, as well as an outline of the deployment procedures. The paper also documents the participant privacy procedures and their underlying principles. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SOC (Social and Economic Networks). Other possible sub-categories include cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity and Privacy), cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
