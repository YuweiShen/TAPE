The paper also mentions the use of sparsity-inducing norms for variable selection, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The simulations on datasets from the UCI repository suggest that the paper may also fall under the category of computer vision (cs.CV) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the computational cost of the proposed method, which may also make it relevant to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
