The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques to detect adversarial attacks, which falls under the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The specific focus on image classification tasks (as mentioned in the abstract) suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) may also be a relevant subfield. Finally, the paper discusses the use of stateful defenses, which could be considered a topic in systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
