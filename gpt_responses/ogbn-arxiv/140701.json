Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also focuses on improving the efficiency of DNNs, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The proposed activation unit is learnable and has spatial connections, indicating that it could also be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the experiments conducted in the paper involve denoising, de-raining, and super resolution, which are all related to image and video processing, suggesting that cs.MM (Multimedia) could also be a relevant category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
