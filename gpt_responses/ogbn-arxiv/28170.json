This falls under the sub-category of Natural Language Processing (NLP) which is covered by cs.CL. Additionally, the paper uses deep learning techniques such as bidirectional LSTMs and residual learning, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves information retrieval techniques, which are covered by the sub-category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper proposes a KBQA system, which can be categorized under Neural Networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
