The paper also introduces a random-walk based definition of high-dimensional expansion, which involves information theory (cs.IT) and statistical physics (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper extends the Friedgut-Kalai-Naor theorem to high-dimensional expanders, which is related to graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
