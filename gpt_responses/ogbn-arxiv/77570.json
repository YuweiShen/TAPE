The paper discusses question answering (QA) models, which are commonly studied in the natural language processing (NLP) field. Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the evaluation of QA models, which can be related to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper proposes a framework for improving QA models, which can be related to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
