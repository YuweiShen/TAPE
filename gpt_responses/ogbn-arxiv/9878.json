This involves image processing and computer vision techniques, which are typically covered in the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of a neural network also suggests the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also involves medical imaging, which could fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
