The framework involves regularizing the parameters of all models by the tensor trace norm, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper mentions that the sharing strategy is learned in a data-driven way, which suggests the use of neural networks and optimization techniques commonly used in neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
