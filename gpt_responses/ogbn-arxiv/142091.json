This involves dealing with multiple heterogeneous temporal events such as lab tests, diagnosis, and drug administrations. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), clinical informatics (cs.CE), and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
