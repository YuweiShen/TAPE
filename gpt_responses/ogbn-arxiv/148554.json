The use of Apache Spark as a parallel computing framework suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of distributed computing (cs.DC) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The evaluation of different distribution approaches also involves load balancing and query answering cost, which are topics in distributed systems (cs.DL) and computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
