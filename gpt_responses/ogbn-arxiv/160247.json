The paper also mentions software-defined radio applications, which could fall under the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper may also be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category as it involves designing algorithms to improve the performance of decoding systems. Additionally, the paper could be relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category as it involves exploring several decoding paths with SC decoding. Finally, the paper may be relevant to the Architecture (cs.AR) sub-category as it discusses hardware and software implementations of decoding algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
