The paper also introduces a new feature called nominal terms, which simplify CPS proofs by making historical references to past program states first-class. The paper also extends the notion of structured proof with a first-class notion of structured symbolic execution of CPS models. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper introduces a new language for interactive proof in differential dynamic logic (dL) for safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS), which is a topic related to logic in computer science. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper introduces a new feature called nominal terms, which simplify CPS proofs by making historical references to past program states first-class. This feature is related to programming languages. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a new language for interactive proof in differential dynamic logic (dL) for safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS), which is a topic related to software engineering. \n- cs.LF (Logic and Foundations): The paper introduces a new language for interactive proof in differential dynamic logic (dL) for safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS), which is a topic related to logic and foundations"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
