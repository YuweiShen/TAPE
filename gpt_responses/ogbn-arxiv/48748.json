The paper also involves the study of polytopes and their extension complexity, which falls under computational geometry (cs.CG). Additionally, the paper discusses the connection between SDPs and sum-of-squares SDP hierarchy, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
