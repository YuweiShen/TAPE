The use of the Poljak-Turz\u00edk bound and its generalization for Max-Cut also suggests that it could belong to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) or Computational Geometry (cs.CG) categories. The mention of FPT algorithms and parameterized complexity suggests that it could also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category.
