The proposed network architecture, EDANet, incorporates dense connectivity and dilated convolution, which are common techniques in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also emphasizes efficiency and low computational cost, which are important considerations in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the practical applications of real-time semantic segmentation include self-driving and robots, which fall under the category of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
