The authors use GPS data to identify outlier trajectories and develop a tool to visualize and explore these trajectories. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper has implications for public transportation policy and urban planning, as it provides insights into the behavior of the bus system in Rio de Janeiro. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper uses machine learning techniques (specifically, a Convolutional Neural Network) to automatically detect outlier trajectories in the bus data. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper deals with large-scale GPS data and how to efficiently store and analyze it. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a Convolutional Neural Network to detect outlier trajectories in the bus data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
