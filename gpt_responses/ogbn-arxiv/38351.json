The paper proposes a new loss function for end-to-end training of deep multi-object trackers, which involves approximating the Hungarian matching algorithm using a Deep Hungarian Net (DHN) module. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves optimizing the performance of multi-object trackers, which could be relevant to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on the MOTChallenge benchmark, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
