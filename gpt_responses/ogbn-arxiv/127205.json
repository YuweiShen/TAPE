The paper also discusses the accuracy and execution time of different neural networks, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of this work is for self-driving cars, which falls under robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for object recognition tasks, which is related to computer vision (cs.CV) and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
