The proposed methods involve optimization techniques, which are also relevant to the sub-category of optimization and control (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the impact of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the estimation error, which is a topic related to networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper proposes methods for dimensionality reduction and regularization, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
