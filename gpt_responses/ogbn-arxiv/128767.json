The proposed method involves estimating 2.5D sketches and 3D object shape, which involves graphics (cs.GR). The approach is learning-based, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The model is end-to-end trainable and can be applied to real images, which involves robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
