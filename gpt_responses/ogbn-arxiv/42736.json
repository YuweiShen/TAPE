It also involves the study of the impact of an adversary on the communication, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of a slotted channel model and the consideration of transmission time suggest that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia systems (cs.MM), networked systems (cs.NI), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
