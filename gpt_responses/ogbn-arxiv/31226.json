This topic falls under multiple sub-categories, but the most relevant ones are Multimedia (cs.MM) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). Information Theory (cs.IT) is also relevant as it deals with the compression and transmission of information. Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) are less likely but still possible sub-categories as they deal with video processing and cloud datacenters, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
