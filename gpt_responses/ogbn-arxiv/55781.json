The paper also proposes a novel pooling strategy that can be used with any existing deep models, which could fall under machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the performance of state-of-the-art forensic algorithms, which could fall under computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper deals with image dimensions and their impact on algorithm performance, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
