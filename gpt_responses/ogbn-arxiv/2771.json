The paper also discusses optimization algorithms for finding the optimal solution, which falls under machine learning (cs.MM) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The use of Gaussian signaling is also relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
