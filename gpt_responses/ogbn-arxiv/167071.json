This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of features and classifiers, which are common in computer vision (cs.CV) and data science (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses the cost of changes and sensitivity analysis, which are relevant to computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
