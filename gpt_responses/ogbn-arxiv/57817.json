The paper also incorporates human visual sensitivity and just noticeable difference (JND), which are related to human perception and could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of attention mechanisms and end-to-end optimization could also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
