The use of regular expressions and finite automata also suggests a connection to natural language processing (cs.CL). The analysis of relevant calculations and the speed-up achieved through approximation relate to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the variety of applications mentioned, including information retrieval and full text recognition, suggests a potential connection to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
