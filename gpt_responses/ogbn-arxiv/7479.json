Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses a pre-trained convolution neural network and transfer learning to extract features from video frames, which suggests it could also belong to the Signal Processing (cs.SD) sub-category. The paper also mentions using a minimalistic set of parameters for the auditory content, which suggests it could belong to the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses a support vector regressor (SVR) for prediction, which suggests it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
