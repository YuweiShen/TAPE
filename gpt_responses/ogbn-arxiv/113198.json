The paper proposes a parallel incremental rule mining framework that efficiently mines rules based on the relational model and applies updates to large knowledge bases. The paper also applies multiple optimization techniques to reduce runtime, which involves distributed computing techniques. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DB, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.IR, and cs.DC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
