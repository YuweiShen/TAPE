This suggests that the paper may belong to the cryptography and security sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper deals with DNN model compression methods, which are a subfield of machine learning. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): DNNs are widely used in computer vision tasks, and the paper's proposed framework may have applications in this subfield.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses hardware experiments to validate the proposed framework, which suggests that it may belong to the systems and control sub-category.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes an ADMM-based solution for weight pruning, which involves distributed optimization.
