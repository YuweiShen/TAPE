Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of different deep learning frameworks and their suitability for the problem, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves the use of real-time map building functions, which could be classified under cs.RO (Robotics) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper involves the analysis of the process of semi-automated dataset labelling, which could be classified under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
