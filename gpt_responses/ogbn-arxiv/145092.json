The paper also proposes an unsupervised domain adaptation approach, which involves learning dictionaries for each domain and forcing nearest coupled data to have identical sparse representations. This involves machine learning techniques such as optimization and regularization, which are common in sub-categories such as machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also uses standard datasets for evaluation, which is common in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
