It may also belong to Information Retrieval (cs.IR) as it involves gathering related information to sentences. Additionally, the use of neural networks for ranking and weak supervision for training suggests that it may belong to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the analysis of syntactic dependencies in sentences may also suggest a potential fit for the Cybersecurity (cs.CY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
