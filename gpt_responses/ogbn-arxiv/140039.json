The paper proposes a novel scheme for training a text detector using only a small amount of pixel-level annotated data and a large amount of data annotated with rectangles or even unlabeled data, which involves the use of weakly supervised learning (cs.LG) and semi-supervised learning (cs.AI). The paper also proposes a novel strategy for generating pseudo mask annotations using ground-truth bounding boxes, which involves the use of information retrieval techniques (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Overall, the paper covers a range of topics in computer science, including computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing, which makes it likely to belong to multiple sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
