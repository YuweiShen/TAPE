Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.ET (Emerging Technologies), which covers new and innovative technologies in computer science. \n\nThe paper also introduces two search algorithms utilizing the observed features, which involve data structures and algorithms. Therefore, it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), which cover the design and analysis of algorithms and machine learning techniques. \n\nThe paper also discusses the time and hardware complexity of the search algorithms, which involves information theory and complexity theory.
