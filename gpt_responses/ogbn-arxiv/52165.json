The system involves Edge Assistant (EA) running on routers/towers and Offload Agent (OA) operating on users' devices. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The proposed system involves offloading tasks to remote cloud servers and local service providers, which can be considered as distributed computing. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper presents a suite of protocols and algorithms for collecting potential service providers and allocating tasks according to user-specified constraints. This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The proposed system involves managing and allocating resources for offloading tasks, which can be considered as a control system. \n5. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) - The proposed system involves multiple agents (Edge Assistant and Offload Agent) working together to achieve a common goal, which can be considered as a multiagent system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
