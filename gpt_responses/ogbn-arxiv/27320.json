This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). However, given the focus on optimization and the use of sums of squares relaxations, cs.SC and cs.NA seem to be the most likely categories. The paper could also be relevant to researchers in cs.LO, cs.DS, and cs.CG who are interested in formal verification and optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
