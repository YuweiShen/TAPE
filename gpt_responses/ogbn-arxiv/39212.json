This involves estimating human partners' engagement levels and using reinforcement learning to learn engaging interactive behaviors. Therefore, the most likely category is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), followed by Robotics (cs.RO) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions using sensory data, which suggests Computer Vision (cs.CV) may be relevant. Finally, the use of reinforcement learning implies that Machine Learning (cs.LG) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
