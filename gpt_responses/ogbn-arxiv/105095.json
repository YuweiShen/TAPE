This involves extracting useful information from the patients' neuroimages using GCN and capturing the information contained in the patient EHRs before the acquisition of each brain image using a memory network. The paper also proposes a multi-hop strategy to enhance the analytical power of the framework. Given this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, since the paper deals with medical data, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
