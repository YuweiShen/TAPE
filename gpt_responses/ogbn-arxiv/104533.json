The specific problem setting of variable-length coding with codeword cost is also related to coding theory (cs.CC). The use of information-spectrum methods suggests a connection to signal processing and communication theory (cs.SI). The analysis of overflow probability involves probability theory and statistics (cs.ST), and the consideration of special sources such as i.i.d. and mixed sources suggests a connection to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
