The paper proposes a novel approach using a closed-loop memory replay GAN (CloGAN) for incremental class learning. This involves generating new images during training and using a small memory unit for maximum sample diversity. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
