Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), followed by cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), as the system involves distributed software platforms. The paper also discusses microgrid control, which falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control), and software architecture, which falls under cs.SE (Software Engineering).
