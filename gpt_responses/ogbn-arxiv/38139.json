The paper also focuses on interpretability and model deployment in memory-constrained environments, which suggests a focus on practical applications. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of deep neural networks and linear probes also suggests a possible fit with cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), while the real manufacturing problem and focus on operational significance suggest a possible fit with cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
