Specifically, it focuses on the problem of finding local minima of a nonconvex function given only access to an approximation of the function. This is a common problem in machine learning, and the paper proposes a new algorithm to address it. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
