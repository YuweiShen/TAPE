The paper proposes a joint open classification model with a sub-model for classifying whether a pair of examples belongs to the same or different classes. This sub-model can serve as a distance function for clustering to discover the hidden classes of the rejected examples. The paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
