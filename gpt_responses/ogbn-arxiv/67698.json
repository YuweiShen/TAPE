The paper specifically focuses on the use of noise injection in these models, which is a technique that can be applied to a wide range of subfields within computer science. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
