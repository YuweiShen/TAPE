The use of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and the consideration of oversampling DACs suggest a focus on signal processing (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also discusses the practical implications of low-resolution DACs, which could fall under computer communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
