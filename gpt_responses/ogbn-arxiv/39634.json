The paper proposes techniques to counter the lead bias in news summarization, which is a common problem in NLP. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also uses reinforcement learning and auxiliary losses, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with information retrieval (cs.IR) since it focuses on extracting important content from a document. Finally, the paper proposes techniques to improve the performance of the system, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
