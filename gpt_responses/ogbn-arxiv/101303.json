The paper also discusses the use of embeddings and image search, which are relevant to Computer Vision (cs.CV). The interactive nature of the system and the incorporation of user feedback suggest a strong connection to Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HCI). The use of natural language processing techniques to understand user feedback could also place this paper in the category of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the evaluation of the algorithm using human-in-the-loop experiments suggests a connection to Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
