Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations and constraints of neuromorphic hardware, which could also place it in the sub-category of \"Emerging Technologies\" (cs.ET). The paper proposes a methodology for transforming existing neural networks to meet the hardware constraints, which could be considered as a form of \"Architecture\" (cs.AR) or \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the co-design optimization of hardware and software, which could be classified as \"Systems and Control\" (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
