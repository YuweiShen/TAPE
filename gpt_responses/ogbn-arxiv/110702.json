This involves optimizing the transmission of useful signals and artificial noise to balance the signal strength and interference at strong and weak users. This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT), cryptography (cs.CR), network security (cs.NI), control systems (cs.SY), and multimedia (cs.MM) as it involves optimizing the transmission of signals in a wireless communication system. Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
