The paper also discusses the use of GPUs for accelerating the training process, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper proposes a novel approach for training with high-resolution 3D medical images, which involves tuning parameters for optimal performance, a topic that falls under neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the reduction of training time, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
