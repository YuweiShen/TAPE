Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel approach to automatic prototype-domain discovery, which involves learning separate re-id models for each discovered prototype-domain. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG and cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach under realistic re-id conditions, which may also make it relevant to the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
