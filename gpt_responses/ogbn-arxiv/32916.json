The paper also introduces a prior fusion network that learns to transfer information from previous images, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of structured representations of scenes in the form of a scene graph, which relates to natural language processing and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
