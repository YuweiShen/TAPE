The paper proposes a new type of activation unit (PReLU) and a new initialization method for training deep rectified models, which are both related to machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed method on the ImageNet dataset, which is a common benchmark for artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL) tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
