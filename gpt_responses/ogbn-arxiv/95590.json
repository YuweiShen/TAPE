The use of perturbation signals to reduce PAPR is a signal processing technique, which could also fall under the category of statistical signal processing (cs.SI). The optimization problem formulation and algorithm development involve mathematical optimization techniques, which could be classified under machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with MIMO systems, which could also fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
