Therefore, it is likely to belong to the categories of computer security (cs.CR) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper discusses the distributed blockchain and simulations on real mobility traces, which suggest that it could also belong to the categories of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
