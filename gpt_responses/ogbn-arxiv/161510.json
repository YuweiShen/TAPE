The paper's focus on transforming non-Gaussian and non-additive channels into modulo-additive noise channels suggests a strong connection to Information Theory (cs.IT). The use of linear coding techniques and capacity results also points towards cs.NI and cs.SI. The paper's potential applications in multimedia communication and signal processing suggest a possible connection to cs.MM. Finally, the paper's discussion of information loss and the limitations of the transformation may relate to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
