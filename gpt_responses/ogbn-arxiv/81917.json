The proposed approach involves learning to aggregate policies from multiple sources, which falls under the category of multi-agent systems and decision-making. The experiments involve simulated environments, which suggests a focus on robotics and control problems. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
