The use of a block-Markov strategy and the combination of different schemes suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of network information theory (cs.NI) and source coding and compression (cs.SI). The mention of Dueck's and Blackwell's channels, which are well-known examples in information theory, suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.MM) and learning theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
