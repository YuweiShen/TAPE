The use of coded modulation (CM) and forward error correction codes also suggests a focus on coding theory and data structures (cs.DS). The application of PAS to increase spectral efficiency may also involve network infrastructure and protocols (cs.NI) and signal processing and analysis (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
