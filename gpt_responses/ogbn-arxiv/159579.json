Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses the implementation of the framework on a real cloud platform, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also mentions the automation process and the use of APIs, which could fall under cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Finally, the paper discusses the deployment of Moving Target Defense (MTD) techniques, which could also fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
