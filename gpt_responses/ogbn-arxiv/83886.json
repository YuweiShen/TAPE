Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves training a model using a large dataset, which is a common technique in machine learning (ML) and falls under cs.LG. The use of deep neural models and the auxiliary expertise learned by the model suggest that the paper may also belong to cs.AI. The paper also involves extensive experiments and evaluation, which may fall under cs.NE. Finally, the paper deals with detecting anomalous images, which may involve some aspects of computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
