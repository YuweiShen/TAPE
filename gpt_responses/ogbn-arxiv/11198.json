The proposed framework involves coordination between the base station and user, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The use of location information and Bayesian decision making also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper specifically mentions millimeter wave technology, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
