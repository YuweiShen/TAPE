This approach involves learning embedding parameters by comparing given data only with precomputed exemplars, resulting in a cost function with linear computational and memory complexity. The paper also proposes a shallow embedding network with high-order feature interactions for data visualization. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
