The use of a neural network also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The segmentation of retinal vasculature could also suggest that it belongs to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category. Finally, the normalization of fundus images could suggest that it belongs to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
