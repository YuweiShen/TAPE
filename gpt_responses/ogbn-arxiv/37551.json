The paper presents a question answering system that utilizes deep text classification models, knowledge graphs, and structure-aware searchers for better performance in answering consumer health questions. These techniques are commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR), which are subfields of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
