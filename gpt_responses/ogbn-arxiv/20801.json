This is a core topic in game theory, and the paper presents several examples of such mechanisms. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper deals with privacy, which is a central topic in cryptography and security. The paper proposes a new way of modelling privacy in players' utility functions, which could be of interest to researchers in this field. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses techniques from machine learning, such as differential privacy, to achieve privacy in economic mechanisms. This could be of interest to researchers in machine learning who are interested in privacy-preserving algorithms. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes new algorithms for solving economic games that are both truthful and preserve privacy. This is a core topic in data structures and algorithms, and the paper presents several examples of such algorithms. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses techniques from information theory, such as differential privacy, to achieve privacy in economic mechanisms.
