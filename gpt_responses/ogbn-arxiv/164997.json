The use of Gaussian processes for trajectory estimation involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of sparse measurements, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV). The problem of localization and mapping is a common problem in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of Gaussian processes for mapping and localization is a popular topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
