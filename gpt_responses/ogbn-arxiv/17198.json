This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to the Computer Vision sub-category. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses deep learning approaches to predict similarity scores between two users based on their face images. This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to the Artificial Intelligence sub-category. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a Siamese Multi-Task deep learning architecture to process face images and predict similarity scores. This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to the Machine Learning sub-category. \n4. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper investigates the feasibility of bridging image-based matching and matching with personal interests, preferences, and attitude. This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to the Human-Computer Interaction sub-category. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper uses a test to capture users' preferences, interests, and attitude that are relevant for forming romantic relationships.
