The paper also proposes a new algorithm for reducing the complexity of these transforms, which involves techniques from both data structures (cs.DS) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses hardware implementation, which falls under the category of computer architecture and embedded systems (cs.AR). Finally, the paper's focus on error correction coding suggests that it may also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
