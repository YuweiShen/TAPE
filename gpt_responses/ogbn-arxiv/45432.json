The paper also discusses the minimum delivery rate required to satisfy all possible demand combinations, which is a problem that can be analyzed using information-theoretic tools. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with content delivery in a network, which is a topic closely related to networking and internet architecture. The paper also discusses the use of local caches by users, which is a common technique used in content delivery networks. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with a network of users with different QoS requirements, which is a topic closely related to social and information networks. The paper also discusses the use of decentralized cache placement, which is a problem that can be analyzed using network science tools. \n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper deals with a distributed system where the server and users are located at different locations, which is a topic closely related to distributed computing. The paper also discusses the use of local caches by users, which is a common technique used in distributed systems. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with content delivery with different distortion requirements, which is a topic closely related to multimedia.
