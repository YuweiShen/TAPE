Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), followed by cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also involves some aspects of distributed computing, which makes cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) a possible category.
