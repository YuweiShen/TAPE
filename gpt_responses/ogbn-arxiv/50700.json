This involves solving partial differential equations, which is a common topic in numerical analysis. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the use of finite element time domain simulations for acoustic, elastodynamic, and electromagnetic problems. This falls under the scope of computational engineering and science. \n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper uses the FEniCS/DOLFIN and dolfin-adjoint libraries for numerical simulations. This falls under the scope of mathematical software. \n- cs.EM (Electromagnetism): The paper presents examples of electromagnetic problems that are solved using the proposed method. \n- cs.SI (Systems and Control): While not a primary focus of the paper, the optimisation procedure for calibrating matched layers can be seen as a control problem, where the goal is to find the optimal parameters for the attenuation functions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
