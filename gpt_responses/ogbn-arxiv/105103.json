The paper specifically focuses on the effectiveness of machine learning classification models, which suggests that it could also fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of Explainable-AI (XAI) techniques, which could place it under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of the attacks and how to defend against them, which could also place it under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
