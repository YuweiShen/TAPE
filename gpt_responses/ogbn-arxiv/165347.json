The algorithm also involves machine learning techniques such as policy optimization (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the evaluation is conducted on a simulated robotic arm and a 6-legged robot, which are both systems related to control and systems engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
