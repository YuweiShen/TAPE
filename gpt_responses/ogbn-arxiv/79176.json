The paper also involves computations on multiple channels and maintaining a logical structure, which falls under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The protocol also involves detecting the presence of licensed users, which falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
