This involves generating inter-frames using bidirectional ConvLSTM and determining whether input sequences are real-normal or not using 3D convolutional layers. These techniques are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) for tasks such as image and video processing. Additionally, abnormal event detection is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.AI, cs.MM, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
