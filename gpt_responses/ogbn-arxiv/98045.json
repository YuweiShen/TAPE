Additionally, the paper introduces a novel stochastic pooling approach, which falls under the umbrella of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of dropout, which is a common regularization technique in neural networks and falls under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category.
