The focus is on improving the transfer of knowledge from a teacher network to a student network, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.NE). The use of singular value decomposition (SVD) is a mathematical technique that is often used in data analysis and dimensionality reduction, which is relevant to the field of data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
