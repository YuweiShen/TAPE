The use of graph theory in the paper suggests that it may belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.PL (Programming Languages) sub-categories. The mention of correctness criteria and Retore's pomset logic suggests that it may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. Finally, the focus on proof nets and their theory suggests that it may belong to the cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
