The paper also applies this strategy to hyper-parameter optimization, which is a subfield of machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
