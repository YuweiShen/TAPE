The use of LDPC codes and the proposed decoding algorithm suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of coding theory (cs.CC). The application of lattices in wireless communication channels makes it relevant to the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The proposed method for constructing parity check matrices and Tanner graphs may also make the paper relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the use of lattices for channel coding and decoding makes it relevant to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
