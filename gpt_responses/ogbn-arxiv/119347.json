Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also proposes a systematic approach to composing multiple objectives using barrier functions, which involves mathematical optimization and control theory, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) another likely sub-category. The paper also uses logical operators to compose the objectives, which is related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper uses experimental verification, which is related to cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
