This involves the use of advanced techniques such as non-coherent joint transmission, precoding, and max-min fairness. These topics are typically studied in the fields of information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), control and systems engineering (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and game theory (cs.GT).
