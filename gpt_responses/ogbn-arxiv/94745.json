The problem of path planning for an autonomous vehicle that moves on a freeway is considered, which is related to robotics (cs.RO). The proposed driving policy is based on deep reinforcement learning, which involves training a neural network, and thus falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also considers scenarios where the road is occupied both by autonomous and manual driving vehicles, which involves control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed policy under realistic scenarios generated by a traffic flow simulator, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) to analyze the simulation results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
