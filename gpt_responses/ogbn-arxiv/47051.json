The co-existence of the cellular system with a radar system requires the consideration of system-level issues, such as interference management and system optimization, which are relevant to the sub-categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of radio frequency (RF) technology is central to the paper, making this sub-category also a likely fit."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
