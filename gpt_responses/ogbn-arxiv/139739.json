The use of Slepian-Wolf source coding and block Markov coding suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper addresses the problem of sending correlated sources over a two user interference channel, which falls under the category of computer communications (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
