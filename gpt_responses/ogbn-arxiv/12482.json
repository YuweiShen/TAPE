The privacy restrictions are expressed as policy views, which are a common tool in the field of data privacy (cs.CR). The proposed protocol provides formal privacy guarantees, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also proposes an algorithm for repairing mappings, which involves computational aspects and could be relevant to the field of data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
