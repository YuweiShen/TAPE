It uses natural language processing techniques to analyze the lyrics, which falls under the scope of cs.CL.\n\n2. cs.SD (Sound) - The paper focuses on analyzing song lyrics, which is a part of the broader field of sound. The analysis of lyrics is done in the context of music, which makes cs.SD a likely sub-category.\n\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper uses distributed representation methods to analyze the lyrics, which is a machine learning technique. This makes cs.LG a likely sub-category.\n\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper involves the use of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyze song lyrics. This falls under the scope of cs.AI.\n\n5. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses the biases present in song lyrics and how they reflect the biases in society. This makes cs.CY a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
