The paper proposes an extension of SparseMAP, a differentiable method for structured prediction, which is relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also uses factor graphs, a graphical model commonly used in natural language processing and computer vision, which makes it relevant to the sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper presents experiments on three structured prediction tasks, which suggests that it could also be relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
