This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) as it involves optimizing the transmission of information over a noisy channel. The paper also discusses the use of compressive sensing, which is a popular technique in signal processing (cs.NI). The proposed iterative reweight-based scheme involves optimizing an objective function, which is a common approach in optimization and machine learning (cs.SI). The paper specifically focuses on mmWave massive MIMO systems, which is a subfield of wireless communication (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of singular value decomposition (SVD) to reduce computational complexity, which is a common technique in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
