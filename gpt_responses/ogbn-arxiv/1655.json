The use of stochastic algorithms and the focus on reducing synchronization overheads also suggest a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) research. The NOTIFY-ACK semantics used in ASAP also have similarities to distributed systems (cs.SY) research. Finally, the paper specifically mentions distributed machine learning applications, which falls under the sub-category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
