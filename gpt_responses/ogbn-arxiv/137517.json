The proposed method uses conditional generative adversarial networks, which is a popular technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of semantic segmentation, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL).
