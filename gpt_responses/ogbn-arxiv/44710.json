This falls under the scope of robotics (cs.RO) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper also involves algorithmic and computational complexity analysis, which suggests categories such as computer science and game theory (cs.CC), systems and control (cs.SY), and mathematical aspects of computer science (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
