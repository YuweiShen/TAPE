This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes algorithms for constructing these data structures in optimal time and space, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) sub-category. The paper also mentions that these data structures are widely used in information retrieval (IR), which suggests that it may belong to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category. The paper also deals with strings of distinct characters, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes algorithms that are optimal in time and space, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category, as optimization is a key aspect of many machine learning algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
