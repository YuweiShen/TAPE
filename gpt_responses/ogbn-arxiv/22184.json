The paper also discusses the use of bogus information to improve network performance, which could be considered a security issue (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper proposes new algorithmic ideas for optimizing traffic splitting ratios, which could be relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the challenges of obtaining accurate knowledge of traffic demands, which could be relevant to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
