The paper also talks about optimizing query processing and code generation, which is related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also discusses machine learning kernels, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper presents a new back-end for Spark, which involves extending the scope of optimization and code generation to large classes of UDFs, which is related to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
