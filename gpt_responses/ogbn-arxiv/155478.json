The paper also introduces a new model called Timed Probabilistic Workflow Nets (TPWNs), which involves the use of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), a common topic in the field of Data Structures (cs.DS) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of computing the expected time of TPWNs, which is a common topic in the field of Software Engineering (cs.SE) and Programming Languages (cs.PL).
