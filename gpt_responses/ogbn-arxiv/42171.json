This suggests a strong connection to computational linguistics. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The long term aim of the project is to design a writing guide based on the real and regular writing of requirements, which is a key aspect of software engineering. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of natural language processing tools to identify non-compliant sentences suggests a connection to AI. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The use of natural language processing tools suggests a connection to machine learning. \n- cs.CY (Cryptography and Security): There is no direct connection to cryptography and security in the paper, but it is possible that the space project involves security considerations that are not explicitly mentioned in the abstract."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
