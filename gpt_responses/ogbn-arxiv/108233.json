The proposed technique involves normalization of feature maps, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of attention mechanisms, which is a popular topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of normalization to handle outliers is a common problem in neural networks (cs.NE).
