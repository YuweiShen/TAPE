The paper also heavily relies on neural network models, which are a common tool in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses transfer learning, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks and machine learning (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the evaluation of summarization performance using ROUGE scores, which is a common metric in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
