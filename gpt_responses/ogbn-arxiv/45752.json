This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a new model for explicit representation of object interactions, which involves learning a latent graph structure, indicating relevance to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper introduces a new dataset for collision detection, which could be relevant to computer security (cs.CR) as it involves real-life driving collisions and near-collisions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
