The focus on improving the quality of crowdsourced labels through the use of approval voting and incentive mechanisms suggests a human-computer interaction (cs.HC) aspect to the research. The use of optimization techniques and theoretical guarantees of optimality suggest a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and optimization (cs.CY). Finally, the empirical studies conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk suggest a focus on social and information networks (cs.SI) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
