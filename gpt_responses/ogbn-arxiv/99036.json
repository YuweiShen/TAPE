The paper also mentions the use of Model Predictive Control (MPC) which is a popular control technique in Robotics (cs.RO) and Autonomous Systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper's focus on exploration and planning aligns with the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. The paper's use of continuous control benchmarks suggests a possible connection to Computer Vision (cs.CV) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
