The proposed metric, Frechet Joint Distance (FJD), involves measuring the distance between joint distributions of images and conditioning, which is a statistical concept that is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve generating images based on different types of conditioning modalities, such as object masks and text captions, which are also relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
