Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves learning PDEs from data, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of optimal control methods implies that it could also be categorized under cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
