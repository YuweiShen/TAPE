The paper also discusses the issue of error messages, which is relevant to the logic in computer science (cs.LO) sub-category. The use of gradual refinement types is related to type systems (cs.TYPES) and the practical implementation of the approach is related to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
