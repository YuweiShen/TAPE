Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes several optimizations to improve efficiency, which involves network architecture design and scaling methods, indicating that it may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper involves the use of neural networks, which falls under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, since the paper is about object detection, it may also belong to cs.RO (Robotics and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
