This falls under the category of networking and information theory, which is covered by cs.NI and cs.IT. The use of millimeter wave technology is also a key aspect of the paper, which could place it under cs.MM. Additionally, the paper deals with communication protocols and techniques, which could fall under cs.COMM. Finally, the proposed scheme involves coordination between nodes, which could be considered a system-level aspect and thus fall under cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
