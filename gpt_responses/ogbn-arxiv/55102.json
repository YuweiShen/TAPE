The use of deep RL also falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves using sensor readings to directly map to actions, which can be related to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the practicality and efficiency of the proposed method, which can be related to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
