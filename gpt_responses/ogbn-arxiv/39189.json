Additionally, the study involves analyzing physiological, subjective, and performance aspects, which could also place it in the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. The use of machine learning algorithms to analyze the EEG data could also suggest a connection to the Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The study involves the use of a VR headset, which could place it in the Cybersecurity (cs.CYBER) sub-category, as VR technology is often used in cybersecurity research. Finally, the study involves the collection and analysis of a large dataset, which could suggest a connection to the Software Engineering (cs.SD) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
