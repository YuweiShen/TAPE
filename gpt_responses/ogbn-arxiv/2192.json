The measure leverages recent advances in semantic parsing and provides a reference-less automatic evaluation procedure. Given that the paper deals with natural language processing and machine learning techniques, it is most likely to belong to the categories of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper also deals with information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE), which are also relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
