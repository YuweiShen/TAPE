This task is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG), as it involves learning patterns and features from images. The paper also mentions the use of personalized facial characteristics, which suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the practicality of collecting face pairs from neighboring age groups, which could involve multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
