Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves deep learning techniques and evaluation metrics, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the ability of NMT models to capture linguistic phenomena, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of multilingual models could also suggest a connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions the impact of the choice of translation unit on the linguistic properties captured, which could relate to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and image processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
