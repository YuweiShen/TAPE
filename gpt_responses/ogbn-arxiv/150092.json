The focus is on improving the efficiency of these networks for deployment on resource-constrained devices, which is a common concern in the field of embedded systems and IoT (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses optimization techniques for implementing the pruned networks, which falls under the category of numerical analysis and optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
