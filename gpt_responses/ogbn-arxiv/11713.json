The search for minimum storage regenerating codes involves optimization and combinatorial algorithms, which are relevant to distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper also discusses symmetry conditions and equivalence classes, which are topics in algebraic geometry and group theory, respectively, making cs.SI a likely sub-category. The use of recovered coefficients and general position also suggests numerical analysis (cs.NA) and computational complexity (cs.CC) as possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
