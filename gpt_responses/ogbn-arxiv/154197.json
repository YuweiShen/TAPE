The paper discusses the use of adaptive beamwidths and centralized routing schemes to optimize end-to-end performance metrics such as data rate, bit error rate, and power consumption. These topics are closely related to the fields of network infrastructure (NI), information theory (IT), optimization and control (OH), robotics (RO), and cryptography and security (CR). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NI, cs.IT, cs.OH, cs.RO, and cs.CR, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
