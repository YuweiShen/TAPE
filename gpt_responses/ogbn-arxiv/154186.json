The paper specifically mentions using ResNet-20, VGG-16, and MobileNet models, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the potential practical applications of the proposed measure, such as in curriculum learning (cs.LG) and importance sampling. Additionally, the paper mentions the concept of PAC learnability, which is a theoretical framework for analyzing machine learning algorithms (cs.AI). The paper's focus on deep learning and its potential applications in various subfields of computer science (such as computer vision, natural language processing, and neural networks) suggests that it could also be relevant to subcategories such as cs.NE (neural and evolutionary computing) and cs.CL (computation and language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
