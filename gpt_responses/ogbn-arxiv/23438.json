The algorithm does not require the usual assumptions of no forgetting and regularity, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the NP-hardness of the problem and the existence of a fully polynomial time approximation scheme, which is related to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
