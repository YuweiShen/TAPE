The use of mutual information as a privacy metric and the focus on high privacy regimes suggest that this paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the consideration of utility metrics and the optimization of privacy-utility trade-offs may also make this paper relevant to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
