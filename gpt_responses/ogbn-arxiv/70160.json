This is a topic that falls under the intersection of several sub-fields of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and cryptography and security (cs.CR). However, given that the focus of the paper is on developing an algorithm for RL, cs.AI and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The use of reward machines also suggests a potential application in robotics, hence cs.RO is also likely. Finally, the paper discusses the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm, which could be of interest to researchers in systems and control (cs.SY) and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
