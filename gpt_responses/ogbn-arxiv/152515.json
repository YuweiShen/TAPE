Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), followed by cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in securing UAV networks, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a likely category. Finally, the paper proposes novel mitigation techniques, which falls under the scope of cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
