The paper discusses the computational complexity of existing algorithms and proposes a new approach that improves clustering accuracy while maintaining low computational complexity. The paper also provides numerical results on both synthetic and real-world data. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses optimization and numerical analysis, which suggest possible sub-categories of cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
