The use of neural networks and fuzzy logic also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The focus on improving cost estimation and reflecting industry trends suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the use of Function Point analysis suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
