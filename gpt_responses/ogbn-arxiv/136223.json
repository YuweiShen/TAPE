Additionally, the paper discusses the communication efficiency of the proposed methods, which could also be relevant to \"cs.DC\" (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The use of adaptive optimization methods is a common technique in various areas of artificial intelligence, which could place this paper under \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence). The authors also mention the potential applications of their methods in computer vision, which could relate to \"cs.CV\" (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Finally, the paper's analysis of convergence behavior could also be relevant to \"cs.SY\" (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
