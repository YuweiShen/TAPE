The addition of a single bit of communication also suggests a focus on network communication (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of the term \"memoryless network\" suggests a possible connection to distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the study of capacity regions in networks can also be relevant to computer communication (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
