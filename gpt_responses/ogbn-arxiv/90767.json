The paper also heavily relies on recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning and reinforcement learning, which suggests that it could also belong to the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of reinforcement learning to train the robotic system also suggests that it could belong to the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper tests its method on a model of the Fetch Robotics Manipulator, which involves visual perception and manipulation, suggesting that it could also belong to the category of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
