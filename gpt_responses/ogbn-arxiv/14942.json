This is a common problem in computer vision and machine learning, which is typically addressed in the sub-categories of computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), multimedia (cs.MM), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Given that the paper focuses on video-level representation and prediction, it is most likely to belong to cs.CV, followed by cs.LG and cs.MM. The use of a learnable aggregation technique and its application to a real-fake expression prediction dataset also suggests that the paper may be relevant to cs.AI and cs.HC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
