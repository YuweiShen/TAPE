The evaluation also involves statistical modeling (SD) to estimate the performance of the chord recognition systems. The paper also discusses the generalization of chord recognition systems to different genres, which could fall under multimedia (MM) or signal processing (SI). Finally, the paper proposes a new evaluation metric, which could be relevant to data quality (SDQ) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
