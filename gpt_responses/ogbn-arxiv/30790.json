The paper also discusses optimization techniques and uses Monte Carlo sampling, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves statistical modeling and probability theory, which are relevant to the sub-category of statistics (cs.SD). Finally, the paper deals with optimizing performance metrics, which is a topic in systems and control (cs.SY).
