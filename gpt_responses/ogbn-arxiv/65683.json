The method proposed in the paper involves training a secondary network to create explanation masks for pre-trained networks, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The authors demonstrate the applicability of their method for image classification with CNNs (cs.CV), sentiment analysis with RNNs (cs.CL), and chemical property prediction with mixed CNN/RNN architectures (cs.CR). Therefore, these four sub-categories are likely to be relevant to the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
