The paper also discusses the use of neural networks for function approximation, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of obstacle avoidance, which is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses stability and constraint satisfaction, which are topics in control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
