The use of compressed sensing (CS) techniques is a key aspect of the proposed system, which suggests that it could also be relevant to the information theory (cs.IT) category. Additionally, the paper involves image processing and computer vision techniques, which could make it relevant to the computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV) category. The use of OFDM transmission and channel-awareness suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) category. Finally, the paper proposes an adaptive approach to video compression and transmission, which could make it relevant to the signal processing (cs.SI) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
