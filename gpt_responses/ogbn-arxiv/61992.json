This problem is closely related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and distributed computing (cs.DC), as well as data caching and pre-fetching (cs.DL). Additionally, the paper touches on human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) as it explores the user experience and the physical limitations of data transfer."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
