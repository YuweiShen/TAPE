The paper also discusses a learning framework for the proposed model, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The paper uses stochastic synapses and variational learning, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-categories.
