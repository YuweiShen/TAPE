The paper also mentions the use of structured and random codes, which are commonly used in Network Information Theory (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the limitations of structured codes, which is a topic studied in Distributed Systems (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of functional channels, which is a topic studied in Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the failure of structured codes, which is a topic studied in Computational Complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
