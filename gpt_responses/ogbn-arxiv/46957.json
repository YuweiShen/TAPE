This involves mapping molecule structures into a continuous latent space and generating novel compounds with desirable properties. This work involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, which are commonly associated with the computer science sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
