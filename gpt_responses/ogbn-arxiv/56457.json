The use of dependent types also suggests a focus on type systems and programming languages. \n\n2. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The problem of safely integrating third-party code in applications is a software engineering concern. The paper presents a library that addresses this problem, which suggests a focus on software engineering. \n\n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper deals with information-flow control, which is a security concern. The use of MAC and the presentation of novel means of specifying statically enforced declassification policies also suggest a focus on cryptography and security. \n\n4. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The use of dependent types in the library suggests a focus on type theory and logic. \n\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The problem of information-flow control can also be seen as a control problem, where the goal is to ensure that information flows in a controlled and safe manner. This suggests a focus on systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
