The efficient encryption and decryption algorithms rely on linear algebra operations, which is also a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the security of the scheme against quantum computers, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR) and cybersecurity (cs.CY). Finally, the paper discusses the failure probability of the scheme, which is a topic in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
