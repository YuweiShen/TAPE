The paper discusses the problems of length bias and degenerate repetition, which are common issues in natural language processing (NLP) and language modeling, and proposes remedies for these issues. These topics are closely related to the field of computational linguistics (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG), which are the most likely categories for this paper. Additionally, the paper proposes a self-terminating recurrent language model, which is a novel approach to address the issue of infinite-length sequences, and this could be relevant to the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper also discusses empirical results and experiments, which could be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) if the experiments involve image captioning or other visual tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
