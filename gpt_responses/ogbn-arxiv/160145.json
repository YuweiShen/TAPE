The proposed model is based on multi-agent systems, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of simulations to provide evidence for the model's effectiveness suggests a focus on computational science (cs.CR). Overall, the paper's emphasis on resilience and social organization suggests a likely fit with the social and information sciences (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
