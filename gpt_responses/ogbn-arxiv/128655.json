The use of deep Q-networks also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). The problem domain involves robotics and control (cs.RO), as well as computer vision (cs.CV) for processing sensor data. Finally, the application of the approach to autonomous driving systems suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
