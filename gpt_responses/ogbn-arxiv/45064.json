The paper proposes a method for pretraining abstractive news summarization models on large-scale unlabeled corpus by predicting the leading sentences using the rest of an article. This method involves the use of transformer-based models, which are commonly used in NLP. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves information retrieval (IR) techniques, which suggests that it could belong to cs.IR. The paper also involves the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, which suggests that it could belong to cs.AI. Finally, the paper involves the use of neural networks, which suggests that it could belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
