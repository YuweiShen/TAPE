The authors propose a novel system that utilizes machine learning techniques to estimate the trustworthiness of sources and objects, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of Hidden Markov Random Field to model interdependencies among objects, which is a technique commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR). The authors also mention the visualization of the conflict resolution process, which is related to the field of visualization and human-computer interaction (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with the scale-free property of Linked Data, which is a topic related to graph theory and network analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
