This falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also uses combinatorial techniques and information theory, which are relevant to the categories of information theory (cs.IT), computational geometry (cs.CG), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
