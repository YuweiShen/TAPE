The authors propose a probabilistic program analysis technique to quantify bias in decision-making programs, which is a common task in machine learning applications.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a technique to verify quantitative properties of probabilistic programs, which is a common task in AI. The authors apply this technique to quantify bias in decision-making programs, which is a common concern in AI applications.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the need to investigate whether programs are biased, which is a security concern. The authors propose a verification tool to quantify program bias, which can be useful in security applications.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the fairness of decision-making programs, which is a social concern. The authors propose a technique to quantify bias in decision-making programs, which can be useful in addressing social issues related to algorithmic decision-making.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a verification tool for quantifying program bias, which is a software engineering task. The authors evaluate the tool on a range of decision-making programs, which is a common task in software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
