The problem is studied in the context of planar graphs, which suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.CG (Computational Geometry) sub-category. The paper also introduces a new linear programming relaxation and new techniques, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The problem of finding node-disjoint paths is relevant to network routing, which suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-category. The paper also discusses approximation algorithms, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category. Finally, the paper may belong to the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category, as the problem of finding node-disjoint paths is relevant to network analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
