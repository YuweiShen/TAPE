The design of the observer is performed to achieve global exponential stability with a given decay rate to a set wherein the estimation error is equal to zero. This suggests that the paper is related to the field of systems and control.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, the use of algorithms based on the solution to linear matrix inequalities to design the observer suggests that the paper may be related to the field of machine learning.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes computationally efficient algorithms based on the solution to linear matrix inequalities to design the observer.
