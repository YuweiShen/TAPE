However, the use of relational databases and the evaluation of queries suggest that the paper is most likely to belong to the database (cs.DB) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of statistical ranking models and the development of solvers suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS) sub-categories. Finally, the focus on hardness and the development of approximate solvers suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
