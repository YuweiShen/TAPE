The paper presents new data-dependent generalization guarantees for learning weighted automata expressed in terms of the Rademacher complexity of different families of weighted automata. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), systems and control (cs.SY), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
