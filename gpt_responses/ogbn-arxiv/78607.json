The paper discusses the tuning of parameters in EC, which is a common topic in the neural evolution (cs.NE) and machine learning (cs.LG) subcategories. Additionally, the paper applies EC to biological and biomedical data, which could fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) subcategory. The paper also discusses the practical implications of the findings, which could be relevant to the computational engineering (cs.CE) subcategory. Finally, the paper involves experimentation and analysis, which could be relevant to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) subcategory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
