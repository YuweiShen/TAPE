The paper also mentions the use of evolutionary computation and high performance computing, which could fall under the categories of computational engineering (cs.CE) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the validation and verification of simulation models, which could also relate to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
