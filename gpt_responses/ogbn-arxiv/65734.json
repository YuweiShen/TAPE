The paper proposes a novel method for constructing multi-task networks, which involves assessing the relatedness of tasks based on the usefulness of features, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves optimizing the level of layer sharing in the network, which is a topic of interest in neural networks (cs.NE) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
