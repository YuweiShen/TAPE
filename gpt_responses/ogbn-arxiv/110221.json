The approach also takes into account operator-autonomy agreement, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The optimization of autonomy objectives involves decision-making and control, which can be categorized under systems and control (cs.SY). The approach also involves the use of autonomy inputs, which can be related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
