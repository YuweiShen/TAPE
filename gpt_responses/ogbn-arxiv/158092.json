The focus of the paper is on image classification, which is a common application of computer vision (cs.CV). The use of evolutionary algorithms for optimization is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also discusses the efficiency of the proposed method, which can be seen as a form of optimization in game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
