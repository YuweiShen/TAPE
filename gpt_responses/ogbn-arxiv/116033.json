The use of the Goal Question Metric (GQM) approach suggests a focus on software process measurement and evaluation, which is also relevant to programming languages (cs.PL) and software design (cs.SD). The study involves multiple case studies, which could also be relevant to the cybernetics (cs.CY) sub-category.
