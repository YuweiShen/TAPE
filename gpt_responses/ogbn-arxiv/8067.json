The paper also discusses the challenges of current models and proposes an extension of the MSCOCO dataset, which requires a fine-grained understanding of the relation between text and image, indicating that the paper may also fit into the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of models on various tasks, suggesting that it may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
