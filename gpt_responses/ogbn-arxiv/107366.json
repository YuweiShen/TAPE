This problem is relevant in several areas of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), numerical analysis (cs.NA), and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper provides a new performance guarantee for a convex relaxation approach to solving the problem, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in all of these areas."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
