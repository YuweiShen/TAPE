The use of multiple antennas also suggests that the paper may be relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), which is commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) applications. Finally, the paper discusses the complexity of the proposed algorithm, which could be of interest to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
