Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The approach also involves training two networks to handle easy and hard image regions, respectively, which requires some level of optimization and learning. This suggests that the paper may also belong to sub-categories related to machine learning (ML), such as cs.LG and cs.AI. Additionally, the paper mentions using PSNR as a metric for image difficulty recognition, which is a common measure in multimedia (MM) research. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on several standard benchmarks, which is a common practice in information retrieval (IR) research. Therefore, cs.MM and cs.IR are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
