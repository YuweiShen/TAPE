The use of symmetrization techniques is a common approach in this area, and the paper explicitly mentions the work of Aaronson et al. [AKKT19], who introduced a symmetrization technique involving Laurent polynomials. Therefore, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are both likely categories. \n\nThe paper also involves information theory, as it deals with the amount of information required to approximate a Boolean function. Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is another likely category. \n\nThe paper's use of symmetrization techniques and its focus on lower bounds suggest that it may also be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). However, these categories are less likely than the previous three."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
