This topic falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-categories. The paper also involves statistical analysis and machine learning techniques such as linear regression (cs.MM, cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with biometric identification (cs.IR) which is another relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
