The use of maximum rank distance (MRD) codes and subspace signatures also suggests a strong connection to information theory. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the use of regenerating codes and locally repairable codes for distributed storage, which are data structures used in distributed storage systems. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with distributed storage systems, which are often used in social and information networks. \n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper presents mechanisms for achieving error resilience in the presence of adversarial errors, which may involve computational complexity considerations. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper deals with error resilience in the presence of adversarial errors, which is a topic closely related to cryptography and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
