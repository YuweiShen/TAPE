The use of convex functions to represent the structure of the signal suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), Signal Processing (cs.SP), or Statistics (cs.ST). However, the focus on exact side information and the use of non-asymptotic and sharp error bounds suggest that the paper may be more closely related to the sub-category of Signal Processing (cs.SP) or Statistics (cs.ST)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
