The use of Gaussian processes and kernel-dependent regret bounds suggests that the paper is likely to be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning), while the focus on game theory and multi-agent systems suggests cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). The use of bandit algorithms and the consideration of noisy feedback suggest cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), while the application of the proposed algorithm to real-world problems of traffic routing and movie recommendation suggests cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
