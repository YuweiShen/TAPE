The use of depth sensors and RGB views for constructing a semantic map suggests computer vision and image processing. The iterative retraining of semantic segmentation and label propagation suggest machine learning and artificial intelligence. The use of meshes for representing the semantic map suggests computer graphics. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.RO (Robotics). The use of machine learning and artificial intelligence suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as likely sub-categories. The use of meshes suggests cs.GR (Computer Graphics) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
