The use of linear programming and optimization methods suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of mathematical optimization (cs.MA). The application of the proposed methods to robotic motion planning examples indicates that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the use of distributed optimization methods suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
