The paper focuses on the spectral properties and bit-error probability of these systems, and considers both stored-reference (SR) and transmitted-reference (TR) systems. The main topics covered in the paper, such as spectral analysis, multiuser interference, and error probability analysis, are typically studied in the fields of information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), multimedia (cs.MM), control systems (cs.SY), and machine learning (cs.LG). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
