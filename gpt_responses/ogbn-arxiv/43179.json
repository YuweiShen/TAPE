The paper also discusses the issue of ensuring causality in FRP languages, which is related to logic and verification (cs.LO) and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper proposes a new approach to modal types, which simplifies the type system, and this is related to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). Finally, the paper discusses the issue of time leaks in FRP languages, which is related to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
