The use of selection methods and task-driven scenarios also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.MA) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The evaluation of the algorithms in multi-robot navigation and collective foraging tasks suggests that it could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the use of measures to compare the selection methods suggests that it could also belong to the Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
