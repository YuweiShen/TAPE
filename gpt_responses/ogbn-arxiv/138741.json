The study focuses on metrics such as code size and cyclomatic complexity, which are often used in machine learning (cs.LG) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper argues for a more stylistically appropriate approach to testing in the Scala community, which could fall under the category of other computer science (cs.OH)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
