This falls under the domain of computer vision. \n2. cs.GR (Graphics) - The paper also discusses decomposition and editing of the multispectral face images, which involves graphics techniques. \n3. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - The paper's focus on face images and biophysical parameters could have implications for human-computer interaction applications such as facial recognition and virtual try-on systems. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with multispectral face images, which is a type of multimedia data. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper's focus on biophysical parameter maps could have applications in medical imaging and information retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
