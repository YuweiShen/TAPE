The algorithms are memory-efficient and can be applied to networks of small devices such as the Internet of Things, wireless or ad-hoc networks, and streaming algorithms, which also falls under the category of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). The paper also presents solutions for classic distributed problems such as leader election, tree constructions, and traversals, which falls under the category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The paper introduces the Compact Message Passing (CMP) model, which is a communication model, and the algorithms presented in the paper are designed for this model, which falls under the category of Information Theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper also presents a fully compact self-healing routing algorithm, which falls under the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
