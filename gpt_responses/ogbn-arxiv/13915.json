This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses beamforming techniques (cs.SI) and compares the proposed approach with existing methods (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of optimizing rate profiles (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
