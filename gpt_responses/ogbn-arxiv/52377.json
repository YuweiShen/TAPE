Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of squeeze-and-excitation blocks, which are commonly used in deep learning models for image recognition, suggesting that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also a likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the transfer of multi-maps and the use of max-min pooling, which are techniques used in multimedia (MM) and information retrieval (IR) research, respectively, indicating that cs.MM and cs.IR are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
