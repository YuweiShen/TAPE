It also involves the use of deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) indicates that it could belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category.
