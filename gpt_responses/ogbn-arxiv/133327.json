Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are the most likely categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a new training method that can potentially reduce the cost of training state-of-the-art models such as BERT and GPT-2, which are widely used in various applications including computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
