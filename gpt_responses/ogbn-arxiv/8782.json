However, the focus on capacity and bit error probability over generalized fading channels suggests that the paper is most likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The use of moment generating functions and mathematical formalism also suggests that the paper may belong to the Communications (cs.COMM) or Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the selected numerical examples suggest that the paper may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
