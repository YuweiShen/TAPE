This falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS). The paper also involves the use of information theory (cs.IT) to analyze the space complexity of the data structures. The design of efficient algorithms for these operations involves the use of combinatorics (cs.DM) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the application of these data structures to text indexing, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
