Additionally, the paper proposes a dynamic-weighting scheme and a pose-directed multi-task CNN, which involve machine learning techniques such as optimization and neural networks, respectively. Therefore, the paper is also likely to belong to sub-categories such as machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
