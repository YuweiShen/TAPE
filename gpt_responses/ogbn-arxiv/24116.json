It proposes a nonparametric method to estimate marginal and conditional distributions and a bootstrap-based approach to test for the exogeneity condition. These methods are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for causal inference. The paper also discusses statistical testing (cs.ST) and information theory (cs.IT) concepts. Finally, the paper validates the proposed method on both synthetic and real data, which falls under the category of simulation and modeling (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
