The model is designed to accurately solve multiple tasks simultaneously, including detecting free space and boundaries, estimating obstacle distance and vehicle attitude, and learning driving behavior and decision making from human drivers. Given the focus on computer vision and machine learning techniques for autonomous driving, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), machine learning (cs.LG), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
