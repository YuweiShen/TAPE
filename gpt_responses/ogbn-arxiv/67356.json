The use of parametric models and differentiable image formation models suggests a focus on graphics (cs.GR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of marginal-likelihood techniques suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the use of image processing techniques suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
