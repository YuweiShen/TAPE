This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) categories. The paper also discusses the challenges of generalization in forgery detection, which is a common problem in machine learning, and proposes a novel approach to address it. This makes it relevant to the categories of cryptography and security (cs.CR), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
