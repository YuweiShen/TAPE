Other likely categories could be cs.CV (computer vision) as CNNs have been successful in image recognition tasks and many image recognition network architectures have been adapted for audio processing tasks. cs.LG (machine learning) could also be a likely category as the paper investigates the reasons why powerful architectures perform worse in ASC compared to simpler models and introduces systematic ways of adapting the RF in CNNs. cs.SI (sound and music computing) and cs.MM (multimedia) could also be possible categories as the paper deals with audio processing tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
