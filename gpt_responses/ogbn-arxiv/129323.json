The paper also discusses the reduction of problems on graphs of small genus, which falls under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper may also be relevant to the field of graph theory (cs.GT) due to its focus on graph embeddings. Finally, the paper's use of stochastic processes to embed graphs into planar distributions may also make it relevant to the field of statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
