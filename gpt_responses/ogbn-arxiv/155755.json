The use of vector quantization and the analysis of error exponents suggest that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The mention of biometric identification and content identification systems suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
