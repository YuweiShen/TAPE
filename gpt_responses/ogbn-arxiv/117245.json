This falls under the domain of computational linguistics (cs.CL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of distributional evidence and semantic vector space models suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The construction of the testbed involves the extraction of typed textual relations, which could also fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
