The use of deep reinforcement learning (RL) also suggests cs.AI as a likely sub-category. The paper also involves graphics (GR) techniques for point cloud integration and multi-view selection. The joint learning of all steps suggests a focus on machine learning (LG) and robotics (RO) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
