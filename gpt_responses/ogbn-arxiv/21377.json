The paper proposes a new framework for Asymmetric DCOPs (ADCOPs) which bridges the gap between multi-agent problems with asymmetric structure and the standard symmetric DCOP model, which falls under the category of Distributed Computing (cs.DC). The paper also presents innovative algorithms that apply to the special properties of the proposed ADCOP model, which falls under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
