The paper also proposes a method for estimating the difficulty of a dataset, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The method involves optimizing network topology and hyper-parameters, which is a common approach in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed method in natural language processing (NLP), which is a subfield of computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
