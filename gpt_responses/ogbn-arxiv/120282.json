Additionally, the paper introduces a novel learning setting that involves human interaction, which could place it in the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The use of explanations in the learning process also suggests it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the plant phenotyping research task mentioned in the abstract could suggest information retrieval (cs.IR) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
