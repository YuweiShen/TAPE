Therefore, cs.SC (Symbolic Computation and Computer Algebra) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves algorithm design and complexity analysis, which suggests cs.SY (Systems and Control) as another likely sub-category. The use of sparse representation and manipulation of certificates suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as a possible sub-category. The paper also involves computational complexity and performance analysis, which suggests cs.CC (Computational Complexity) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of Maple implementation, which suggests cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
