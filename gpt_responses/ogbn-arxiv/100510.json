The proposed method is based on deep learning generative frameworks (cs.LG) and aims to reduce the variability of the samples used in pairwise comparisons, without reducing their discriminability. The paper also introduces a new dataset for unconstrained periocular recognition, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) or computer vision (cs.CV). The experiments involve comparing the levels of performance of different recognition methods, which could be related to cryptography and security (cs.CR) or information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
