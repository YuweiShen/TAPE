The paper also considers uncertainty in the arrival process of neighboring fog nodes, which is related to control systems (cs.SY) and information theory (cs.IT). The proposed online optimization framework involves selecting neighboring nodes and optimizing task distribution, which can be seen as a problem in optimization (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
