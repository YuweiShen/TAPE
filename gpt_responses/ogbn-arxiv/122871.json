The use of meta-learning to predict the best algorithm for each recommendation request involves machine learning techniques such as gradient boosting and generalized linear models, which are commonly used in the fields of machine learning (LG), artificial intelligence (AI), and cybernetics (CY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of content similarity-based algorithms, which are often used in the field of deep learning (DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
