Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of automated testing and debugging techniques, which are common in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also discusses pre- and in-processing techniques, which are relevant to the subfield of data structures (cs.DS).
