The use of no-regret algorithms and mirror descent algorithms also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses convergence and optimization, which are topics in both data structures (cs.DS) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
