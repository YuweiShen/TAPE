The paper also presents a methodology for bitstream file format reversing, which involves reverse engineering and software engineering techniques (cs.SE). The idea of Trojan insertion also involves aspects of computer architecture (cs.AR) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) as the Trojan designer must consider the potential impact on the end user. Finally, the paper touches on the topic of embedded systems (cs.ET) as FPGAs are often used in such systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
