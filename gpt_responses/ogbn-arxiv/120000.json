The use of game semantics and the definition of control hyperdoctrines suggest that the paper belongs to the category of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). The paper also deals with polymorphic arenas and hyperforests, which are related to programming languages and type systems, suggesting that it could also belong to Programming Languages (cs.PL). The study of type isomorphisms and the use of categorical frameworks suggest that the paper could also belong to Logic and Verification (cs.LF) and Graph Theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper deals with equational characterizations, which could suggest that it belongs to Computational Complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
