The approach is based on multiparty session types and leverages the type system of the target language to guarantee only programs that communicate following the protocol will type check. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL), Software Engineering (cs.SE), Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Digital Libraries (cs.DL), or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. However, since the paper focuses on developing web applications, it is less likely to belong to the Machine Learning sub-category, making cs.PL, cs.SE, cs.DC, and cs.DL more likely. Among these, cs.PL and cs.SE are the most likely sub-categories since the paper presents a technique for ensuring the correctness of web applications through static analysis and type checking."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
