The evaluation of the models is based on image classification tasks, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the susceptibility of the models to attacks, which is related to computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a method to improve the robustness of the models, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
