The use of total variation regularization and graph cuts are also common techniques in image and video processing (cs.GR). The paper also mentions the use of optical flow vectors, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM). The projection algorithm and a contrario detection methods mentioned in the paper are related to numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper discusses the use of edge detection functions, which is a common topic in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
