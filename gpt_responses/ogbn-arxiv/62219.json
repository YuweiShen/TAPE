Additionally, the problem involves finding a set of vertices to delete, which is a common theme in Computational Geometry (cs.CG) and Graph Theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper presents a polynomial kernel, which is a technique often used in Parameterized Complexity (cs.CC). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.DS and cs.DM, followed by cs.CG, cs.GT, and cs.CC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
