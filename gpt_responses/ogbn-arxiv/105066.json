The focus on generalisation capability and the use of arbitrary loss functions suggest that cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. The use of ensemble methods and the mention of classification and regression tasks also suggest cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) as likely sub-categories. The mention of a novel training procedure and hyper-parameter initialisation suggests cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the mention of Organic computing (OC) suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
