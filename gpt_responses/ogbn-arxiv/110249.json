Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper involves the construction and study of two distinct deep neural network surrogates, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also deals with optimizing decisions regarding mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery practices for infrastructure systems, which could place it in the sub-category cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper addresses the impact of natural disasters on infrastructure systems, which could also place it in the sub-category cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
