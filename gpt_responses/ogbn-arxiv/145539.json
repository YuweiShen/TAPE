This involves the use of machine learning and control theory, which are commonly associated with the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Robotics (cs.RO), and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). However, since the focus of the paper is on traffic signal control, the first four sub-categories are more likely to be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
