The use of logarithmic regret and sub-logarithmic regret also suggests information theory (cs.IT) as a possible sub-category. The analysis of non-stationary settings and the use of weighted examples may also relate to data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
