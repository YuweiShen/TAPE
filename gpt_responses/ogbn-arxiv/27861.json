This involves extending the unit algorithm into several layers. The experiments conducted involve document and image data, which suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), information retrieval (cs.IR), computational linguistics (cs.CL), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
