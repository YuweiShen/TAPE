The method uses reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust the number of bits used for quantizing gradients based on the information collected from past optimization iterations. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new method for optimizing the training of machine learning models, specifically by reducing communication overhead in parameter server. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses reinforcement learning, a subfield of AI, to develop an adaptive quantization method for gradient quantization. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper addresses the communication overhead issue in parameter server, which is a distributed computing framework for training large scale machine learning models. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper focuses on optimizing the training of deep neural networks, which is a subfield of neural computing. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method for controlling the communication overhead in parameter server, which is a distributed system for training machine learning models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
