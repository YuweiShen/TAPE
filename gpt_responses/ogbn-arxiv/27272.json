The paper also involves characterizing and deriving bounds for certain classes of cyclic codes, which could fall under graph theory (cs.GT) and discrete mathematics (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses a refinement of the Singleton bound, which is a well-known result in coding theory and could be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
