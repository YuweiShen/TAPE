The use of graph-based codes suggests a connection to coding theory (cs.AR). The paper also discusses synchronization errors, which are common in embedded systems (cs.ET) and electromagnetic interference, which is a concern in electronic engineering (cs.EM). Finally, the use of delimiter bits and error correction codes can be applied to neural networks, which fall under the category of neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
