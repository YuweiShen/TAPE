Game theory is a natural fit for analyzing such problems, and the paper explicitly mentions the use of game-theoretic concepts like scoring protocols and rules.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The problem of election manipulation is of interest to AI researchers, as it involves designing algorithms that can reason about the preferences of voters and the strategic behavior of manipulators. The paper proposes algorithms for solving the problem of destructive shift bribery, which is a form of election manipulation.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents algorithms for solving the problem of destructive shift bribery, which involves manipulating the rankings of candidates by voters. This requires designing efficient data structures and algorithms for processing and updating rankings.\n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with a problem in computational social choice, which involves discrete mathematical concepts like voting rules, scoring protocols, and rankings. The paper also uses techniques from discrete mathematics, such as parameterized complexity and hardness proofs.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper analyzes the computational complexity of the problem of destructive shift bribery, showing that it is polynomial-time solvable for some voting rules but NP-hard for others. The paper also provides hardness results for various parameterizations of the problem, which involves analyzing"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
