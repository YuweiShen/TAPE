The use of deep neural networks for training the model also suggests that it could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG). The incorporation of additional information such as time of posting and user albuming suggests that the paper could also be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the use of multiple modalities (image and metadata) suggests that the paper could also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
