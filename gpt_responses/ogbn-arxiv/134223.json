This suggests a focus on robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of tailored linguistic support to specify MRSs, which relates to software engineering (cs.SE) and logic in computer science (cs.LO) sub-categories. Finally, the paper assesses the extent to which different specification languages capture key features of MRSs, which relates to programming languages (cs.PL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
