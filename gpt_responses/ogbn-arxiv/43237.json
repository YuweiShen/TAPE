The paper also proposes a meta-learning approach for NLG, which involves optimizing the model to adapt to new low-resource NLG tasks, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of neural networks for NLG also suggests a connection to neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on a large multi-domain dataset, which involves data management and analysis (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
