The use of parameterized complexity techniques further suggests that it may also belong to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also mentions the complexity classes $\\mathrm{W}[1]$ and $n^{o(k/\\log k)}$, indicating a focus on complexity theory, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-categories of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the title of the paper explicitly mentions \"hereditary properties,\" which is a term commonly used in the context of graph theory, suggesting that it may also belong to the sub-category of graph theory (cs.GT).
