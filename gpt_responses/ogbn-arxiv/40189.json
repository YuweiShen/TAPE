This involves setting up linear structured convex and nested structured concave objective functions, which are optimized using stochastic optimization methods. The experimental results cover a range of tasks including Information Retrieval, Combining Distributed Neural Networks, Influencers in Social Networks, and Distributed Automatic Speech Recognition, indicating that the paper could potentially fit into several arXiv CS sub-categories. However, given the focus on optimization and machine learning techniques, as well as the use of Information Retrieval as one of the experimental tasks, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are the most likely sub-categories. Other possible sub-categories include cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
