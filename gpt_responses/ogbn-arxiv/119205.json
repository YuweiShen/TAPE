This is a common topic in artificial intelligence and optimization research.\n- cs.DM: The paper deals with phylogenetic trees, which are a type of hierarchical clustering. This is a common topic in data mining and clustering research.\n- cs.LG: The paper presents a constraint-based solution to the supertree construction problem, which involves learning and inference. This is a common topic in machine learning and probabilistic reasoning research.\n- cs.CE: The paper presents a constraint programming encoding for the ultrametric property of rooted trees, which is a type of constraint satisfaction problem. This is a common topic in constraint programming and constraint-based reasoning research.\n- cs.DS: The paper deals with the construction of supertrees, which involves manipulating and combining large amounts of data.
