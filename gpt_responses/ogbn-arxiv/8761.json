The paper also introduces a new summary parameter called the statistical dimension, which is a geometric concept that is relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper's technical results involve the concentration of intrinsic volumes of convex cones, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DS). Finally, the paper's applications to regularized linear inverse problems and demixing problems suggest that it may also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SP) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
