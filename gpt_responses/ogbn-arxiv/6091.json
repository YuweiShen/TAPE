The use of algebraic techniques suggests a possible connection to algebraic algorithms (cs.SC) as well. However, since the focus is on witness extraction and practical scalability, rather than theoretical complexity or algebraic complexity, we consider the aforementioned sub-categories to be more likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
