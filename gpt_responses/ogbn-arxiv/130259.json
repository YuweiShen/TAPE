This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a deep neural network-based predictor, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of a large-scale database and the analysis of handcrafted features suggest that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the use of a deep neural network suggests that the paper may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
