The robots also contain guidance, navigation, and control sensors and electronics, which suggests the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for their operation. The use of multiple robots operating as a team also implies the need for distributed command and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of cameras for photo mapping and navigation, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the development of low-cost methods for surface exploration, which suggests a focus on robotics and automation (cs.ROBOTS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
