The approach proposed involves training a neural network to predict pose directly from a 2D image of the scene, which is a computer vision task (cs.CV). The use of domain randomization and simulation-based training also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with the integration of perception and control, which is a topic in systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
