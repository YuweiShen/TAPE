This falls under the hardware architecture sub-category.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper focuses on deep neural networks and their processing, including both training and recognition capabilities. This falls under the neural computing sub-category.\n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The use of memristor crossbars for low power high throughput execution is an emerging technology in the field of computing. This falls under the emerging technologies sub-category.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper compares the proposed architecture with the NVIDIA Telsa K20 GPGPU in terms of system level area and power benefits. This involves parallel computing and falls under the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing sub-category.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed architecture could be used for various applications such as classification, dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and anomaly detection. These applications involve control and decision making, which falls under the systems and control sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
