The use of log-concave distributions is also a common topic in computer science, particularly in optimization and machine learning, which fall under cs.DS and cs.LG, respectively. The paper's focus on smooth interpolation and continuity suggests a possible connection to signal processing and interpolation (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
