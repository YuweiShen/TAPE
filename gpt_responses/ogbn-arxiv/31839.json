The proposed solution involves a tagging system, which is commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the development of applications, which falls under software engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the proposed mechanism for users to generate their own tags and share them with peers involves social computing (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
