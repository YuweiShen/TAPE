The use of a patch-based Siamese network also suggests that it could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also involves the analysis of large datasets, which could place it under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the evaluation of the matching network in a full detection pipeline suggests that it could also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
