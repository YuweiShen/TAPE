The exploration planner is based on Next-Best Views (NBVs), which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV) to identify promising viewpoints. The planner also uses optimization techniques to improve sampling efficiency, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also evaluates the method using simulated scenarios, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG) to analyze the results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
