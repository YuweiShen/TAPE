The method is applied to learn better quality compact policies, which is a common problem in reinforcement learning and robotics (cs.AI, cs.RO). The paper also discusses the scalability of the method, which is relevant to optimization and control in large-scale systems (cs.SY). Finally, the method involves the use of neural networks, which is a common tool in deep learning research (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
