The algorithm is based on coordinate ascent on a relative entropy objective, which is a common approach in optimization and information theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also mentions applications in continuous control and deep reinforcement learning, which are relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
