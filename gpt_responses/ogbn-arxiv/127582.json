The proposed method involves a novel PAT module and loss function, which are related to learning and optimization (cs.LG). The use of a hierarchical tree structure and probabilistic assignment of samples also involves probabilistic reasoning and machine learning (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of facial expression datasets, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
