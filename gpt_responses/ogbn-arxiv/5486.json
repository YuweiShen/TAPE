The paper also discusses the optimization of training length and power, which is a problem in networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of MRC receiver and LMMSE method also suggests that the paper may fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and communication (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
