This is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO), where agents need to plan and execute actions in environments with continuous dynamics. The paper also discusses the use of heuristic search algorithms, which is a common technique in planning (cs.PL) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper presents a new planner, FS+, which is designed to handle hybrid domains with global constraints, which is a problem often encountered in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
