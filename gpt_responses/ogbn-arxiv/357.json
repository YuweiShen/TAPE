This involves leveraging a central limit theorem for the empirical measure, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the Hoeffding test, which is a statistical hypothesis testing method used to detect anomalies in Markov models. This involves analyzing the empirical measure of the data, which is a concept related to information theory. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): One of the applications of the Hoeffding test discussed in the paper is in enhancing cyber security in communication networks. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the cryptography and security sub-category. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses an application of the Hoeffding test in transportation networks, which could be considered a type of social network. Additionally, the paper may be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks because it discusses a method for detecting anomalies in network data. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses applications of the Hoeffding test in communication and transportation networks, which suggests that it may be relevant to the networking and internet architecture sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
