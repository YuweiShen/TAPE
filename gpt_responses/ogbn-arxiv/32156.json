The paper also addresses the issue of severe occlusions, which is a challenge in graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper proposes a shape prior term to penalize irregularities in the time-varying structure, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.AI). Finally, the paper provides implementation details for heterogeneous platforms, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
