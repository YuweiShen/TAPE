This involves the acquisition and analysis of three-dimensional motion data, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The use of adaptive assessment modules and personalized feedback also involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the focus on improving safety and performance aligns with the sub-categories of human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and software engineering (cs.SD). Overall, these sub-categories are the most likely to be relevant to this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
