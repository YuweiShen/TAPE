Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), which deals with the study of systems composed of multiple interacting agents. The paper also discusses the control logic of AMoD systems, which falls under the scope of cs.RO (Robotics), as it involves the use of autonomous vehicles. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of simulation to evaluate new propositions and methodologies, which is a common practice in the field of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the need for a standardized simulation platform, which falls under the scope of cs.SY (Systems and Control), as it involves the development of a system for simulating AMoD systems. Finally, the paper mentions the use of open-source software, which is a common practice in the field of cs.LG (Machine Learning), as it involves the development of a platform that can be used by researchers to build on each other's work."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
