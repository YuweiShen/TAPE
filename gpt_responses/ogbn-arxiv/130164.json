The use of distributed semantic vector spaces learned from large text corpora is also discussed, which relates to natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also touches on the limitations and biases of these approaches, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
