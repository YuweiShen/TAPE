The paper focuses on using an adversarial learning framework to detect falls as anomalies in the absence of training data for falls. This involves using a spatio-temporal autoencoder and a spatio-temporal convolution network to learn spatial and temporal features from input video frames. The paper also tests the performance of the proposed framework on camera sensing modalities that may preserve an individual's privacy, such as thermal and depth camera. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
