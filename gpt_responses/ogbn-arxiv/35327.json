The paper discusses the use of nonlinear transformations to achieve decorrelation, which is a common technique in machine learning and signal processing. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the use of distance correlation measurement, which is a common technique in information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the application of the proposed strategies to image processing (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
