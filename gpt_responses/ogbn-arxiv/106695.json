The use of HMMs and POMDPs also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The incorporation of domain-specific information and constraints, as well as the use of real robot data, suggests a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
