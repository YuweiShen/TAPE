The system uses an extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm, which is a common technique in control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of a dynamic model to improve the estimation accuracy, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
