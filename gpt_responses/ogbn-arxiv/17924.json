The use of Deep Learning models such as GoogleNet and Resnet also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The incorporation of segmentation maps in the proposed classification model also indicates that it could belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of Twin U-Net (TUNet) as a novel classification model suggests that it could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
