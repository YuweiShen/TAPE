The proposed framework involves using a stacked encoder-convolutional model, which is a technique commonly used in deep learning (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the security aspect of the proposed framework, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a reduced complexity CNN, which is a topic commonly studied in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
