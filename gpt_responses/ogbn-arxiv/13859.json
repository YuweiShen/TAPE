Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the regularization effect of the proposed strategy, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG - Machine Learning) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI - Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of the trained model for image captioning (cs.CL - Computation and Language) and detection tasks (cs.MM - Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
