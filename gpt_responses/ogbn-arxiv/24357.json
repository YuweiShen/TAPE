The use of recurrent connections is also a key aspect of the paper, which suggests it may fall under the sub-categories of neural networks (cs.NE) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of predictive coding, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
