Additionally, the paper discusses interactive computation of functions by two terminals and interactive computation in a collocated network, which are topics that fall under distributed computing (cs.DC) and social and information networks (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of polar coding for achieving the rate regions for these problems, which is a topic that falls under coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the use of multiple rounds of transmissions, which is a topic that falls under networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
