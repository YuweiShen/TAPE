The paper also discusses the tradeoff between the number of items evaluated by each worker and the fraction of good evaluators, which is related to the field of \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). The algorithmic aspect of the paper involves linear time complexity, which is related to \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the possibility of adversarial attacks, which is related to \"Cryptography and Security\" (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the practical applications of the proposed method in analyzing large datasets, which is related to \"Computational Complexity\" (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
