The paper also introduces a mapping algorithm that converts 3D structures to 2D and 1D data grids, which involves data representation techniques and may fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper explores the performance of CNNs trained on data encoded with their method, which relates to deep learning (cs.DL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
