The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the verification process, which falls under the category of computational complexity theory (cs.CC). The use of synchronous systems and the consideration of timing-based attacks suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also deals with the formulation of new notions of information flow security, which could be of interest to the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the use of finite state systems suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
