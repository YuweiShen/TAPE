It also involves machine learning techniques such as sparse recovery (cs.LG) and hyperplane constructions (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the decoding time, which falls under the category of numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper proposes a new scheme for one-bit compressed sensing, which could be considered a signal processing problem (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
