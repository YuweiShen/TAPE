This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper proposes a new cut-set bound for the computing rate of a network code, which is a fundamental concept in distributed computing (cs.DC) and network science (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the validity of previous results in the literature, which involves computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
