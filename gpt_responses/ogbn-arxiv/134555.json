The algorithms developed for recognizing simply foldable 1D crease patterns and deciding foldability of orthogonal crease patterns on rectangular paper suggest that the paper may also belong to sub-categories related to data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational complexity (cs.CC), and scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
