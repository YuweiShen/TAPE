The paper focuses on generating summaries with limited training data at arbitrary compression budgets. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) sub-category of Computer Science (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper uses supervised sequence-to-sequence networks, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.AI) and deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also evaluates its proposed method using metrics such as ROUGE and METEOR, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper uses an interpretable multi-headed attention model, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
