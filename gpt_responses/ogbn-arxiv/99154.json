The paper also discusses the training of these networks, which falls under machine learning (cs.NE, cs.LG). The implications of the results for using artificial networks to study human vision suggest a potential overlap with artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
