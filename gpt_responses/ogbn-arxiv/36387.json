This topic is related to logic (cs.LO), programming languages (cs.PL), data structures (cs.DS), software engineering (cs.SE), and machine learning (cs.LG). However, since the paper focuses on the theoretical foundations of inference systems and their applications to coinductive definitions, we believe that cs.LO and cs.PL are the most likely sub-categories. The other sub-categories are also relevant, but to a lesser extent."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
