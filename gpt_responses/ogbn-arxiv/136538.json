The algorithm proposed in the paper is based on the recently developed technique of $k$-submodular relaxation, which is a powerful tool for obtaining efficient FPT algorithms for various problems. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
