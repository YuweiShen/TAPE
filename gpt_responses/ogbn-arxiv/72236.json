The paper specifically focuses on deep reinforcement learning and hard-coded rules, which are subfields of machine learning (cs.LG) and game theory (cs.GT), respectively. The authors also mention the use of computer vision techniques for partial observations, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the authors mention the use of simultaneous move for all players, which is a characteristic of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
