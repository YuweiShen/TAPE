This falls under the category of theoretical computer science (cs.THEORY). The paper specifically focuses on contextual equivalence, which is a notion of behavioral equivalence between processes. This falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper also presents a novel proof technique, which could be of interest to researchers in software engineering (cs.SE) and formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
