The paper also proposes a statistical framework for transliteration, which involves machine learning techniques, making it relevant to the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of limited linguistic resources, which is a common challenge in machine learning, making it relevant to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves the use of phonology, which is a subfield of linguistics, making it relevant to the sub-category of cs.SD (Sound). Finally, the paper involves the use of statistical techniques to improve transliteration performance, which is relevant to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
