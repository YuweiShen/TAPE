It explores the applications of three different bio-sensing modalities along with a camera-based vision system in driver awareness context. The paper also assesses the information from these sensors independently and together using both signal processing and deep learning tools. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) as it deals with the interaction between humans and computers. The other likely sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) as it involves the use of a camera-based vision system, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it uses deep learning tools, and cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it deals with the development of perception systems for vehicles."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
