The authors propose a solution that involves image retrieval with deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) features (cs.CV) and map merge to minimize differences in shape between the two maps (cs.LG). The use of DCNN features also suggests an application of machine learning (cs.AI). Finally, the paper addresses the problem of practical computation time, which is a common concern in systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
