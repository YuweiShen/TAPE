This falls under the scope of social and information networks. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper addresses the issue of workload for emergency responders and proposes a solution to optimize their attention. This falls under the scope of computers and society. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper proposes a ranking system for social media alerts based on performance metrics such as recall and NDCG. This falls under the scope of information retrieval. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper addresses the issue of workload for emergency responders and proposes a solution that takes into account the limited budget of attention in a stressful work environment. This falls under the scope of human-computer interaction. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although the paper does not explicitly address cryptography and security, it may be relevant in the context of emergency response and the need to filter and prioritize messages to avoid overwhelming end-users."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
