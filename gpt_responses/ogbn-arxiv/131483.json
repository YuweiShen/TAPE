The use of deep networks for the Adviser Problem and the application to viewpoint estimation suggest that the paper belongs to computer vision (cs.CV). The incorporation of human guidance also suggests that the paper could belong to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of the Adviser Network for decision-making in a real-world task suggests that the paper could also belong to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
