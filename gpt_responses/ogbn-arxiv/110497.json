The paper also involves the use of signal processing techniques to estimate SINR, which is related to information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of interference on throughput and latency, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and security and privacy (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes robust link adaptation schemes to improve reliability, which is related to control and systems engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
