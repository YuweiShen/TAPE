This is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also discusses the potential for using biological brain activity measurements in training deep neural networks, which falls under the categories of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
