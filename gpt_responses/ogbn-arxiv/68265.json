This involves signal processing, communication theory, and optimization techniques, which are all relevant to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also deals with the design and evaluation of the proposed receiver and AGC algorithm using simulations, which falls under the Networked and Distributed Systems (cs.NI) and Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the achievable rate and capacity of the MU-MIMO system, which is related to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
