The focus is on improving the efficiency of greedy algorithms, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) applications. The proposed method involves solving a least square problem, which is a common topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the use of operator-based strategies, which are relevant to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
