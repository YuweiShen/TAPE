The use of optimization techniques and random sampling suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the L1-norm metric function, which is commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the benefits of pre-computing the roadmap offline, which is relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
