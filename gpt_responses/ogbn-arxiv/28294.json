The first stage of the proposed method uses a deep neural network (DL) called ARU-Net. The paper also mentions the use of data augmentation strategies, which is a common technique in DL. The problem of text line detection in historical documents is relevant to information retrieval (IR) and human-computer interaction (HC) as well. Finally, the paper presents experimental results and compares its method with state-of-the-art approaches, which is a common practice in machine learning (ML) and specifically in DL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
