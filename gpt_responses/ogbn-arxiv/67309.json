The use of large antenna arrays and low-complexity algorithms also suggests a focus on mmWave technology (cs.MM) and system design (cs.SY). Finally, the proposed technique involves feedback and control channel design, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
