The paper proposes a novel approach to enhancing the efficiency of random walks over online social networks, which involves constructing a virtual overlay topology of the social network while performing a random walk. This approach involves techniques from network science, data structures, and algorithms, which are relevant to the sub-categories of cs.SI, cs.SOC, cs.DS, cs.DB, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
