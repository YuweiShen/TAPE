It combines two different approaches, one based on term map visualizations and the other on citation-based network analysis. The paper does not focus on a specific area of computer science, but it does use computational methods and techniques. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.CY (Computers and Society), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
