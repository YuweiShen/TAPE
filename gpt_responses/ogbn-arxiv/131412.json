The paper also discusses numerical experiments and algorithms, which suggests that it could belong to cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also mentions surface remeshing and surface registration, which could fall under cs.GR (Graphics) or cs.SI (Sound and Image Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
