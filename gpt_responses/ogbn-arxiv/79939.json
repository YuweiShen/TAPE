The approach involves using Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning and Social-Aware LSTMs to infer the latent factors of human decision-making in an unsupervised manner. The paper also discusses collision avoidance regularization and mutual information maximization. Given the focus on computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Robotics (cs.RO) and social and information networks (cs.SI) are also possible categories given the focus on modeling social interactions and decision-making processes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
