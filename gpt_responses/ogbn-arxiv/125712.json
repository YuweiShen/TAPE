The paper also involves modeling and analyzing the system behavior using mathematical equations, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of buffer management on network performance, which is related to the field of performance evaluation and optimization (cs.PF). Finally, the paper uses simulation and experimental results to validate the proposed model, which is related to the field of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
