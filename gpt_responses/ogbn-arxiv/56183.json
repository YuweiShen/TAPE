This is a key topic in information theory, and the paper proposes a novel approach to optimize the beamforming design for SWIPT systems. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper also deals with the design of wireless networks that support SWIPT, which is a key topic in networking and internet architecture. The proposed beamforming design takes into account imperfect channel state information (CSI) and a minimum required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), which are important considerations in wireless network design. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a non-convex optimization problem for the beamforming design, which is a key topic in systems and control. The proposed problem formulation takes into account a practical non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model, which is an important consideration in the design of SWIPT systems. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the transmission of both information and power over the same wireless channel, which is a key topic in multimedia. The proposed beamforming design aims to maximize the minimum harvested power across several energy harvesting receivers, which"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
