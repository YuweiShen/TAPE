The use of robust regression also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with information retrieval (cs.IR) in the sense that it extracts data from visual representations of information. Finally, the use of deep learning techniques suggests a possible connection to deep learning (cs.DL) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
