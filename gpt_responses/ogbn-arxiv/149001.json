The use of copula analysis to quantify the impact of correlation of initiating outages is a statistical method, which falls under data science (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the development of new approaches for bounding an estimate of the total number of blackout-causing contingencies, which is related to power flow analysis (cs.PF) and computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
