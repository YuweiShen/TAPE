The paper also addresses the challenge of adopting agent-oriented programming by software engineers, which falls under the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE). The library is designed to implement core agent programming concepts, which is related to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The library is also extensible and does not impose restrictions on the programming approach, which is relevant to the sub-category of programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper discusses the library's application to cloud-hosted function-as-a-service environments and Python-based data science tools, which are related to the sub-category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
