This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also discusses examples and variations, which could potentially fall under multimedia (cs.MM) or signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of algorithms and protocols, which could fall under networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category.
