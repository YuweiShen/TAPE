Specifically, the paper proposes a measure based on information theory to compare sets of noisy tiles obtained from binary data. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.DB (Databases), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
