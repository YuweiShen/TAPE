The paper also discusses the sphere bound, tangential bound, and tangential-sphere bound, which are commonly used in coding theory (cs.CC). The use of nested Gallager regions and the generalization of the bounds suggest that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents a new derivation that reveals the equivalence of two sphere bounds, which may be of interest to researchers in theoretical computer science (cs.ITP)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
