However, the use of concentration techniques from mathematical physics of spin glasses suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under Information Theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the examples of inference and learning problems covered by the results, such as spiked matrix and tensor models, committee machine neural network, and multi-layers generalized linear models, suggest that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
