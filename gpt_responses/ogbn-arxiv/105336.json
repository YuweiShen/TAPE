This involves a regression framework based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for accurate estimation of spectral parameters. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the paper involves deep learning-based regression. Additionally, since the paper deals with biomedical research, cs.BIO (Computational Biology) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, since the paper involves neural networks, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
