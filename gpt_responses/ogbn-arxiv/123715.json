The use of a deterministic finite automaton to accomplish the task suggests a focus on algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The problem of constructing a compact structure also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
