The use of an Arbitrarily Varying Channel (AVC) and the study of symmetrizability and invertibility of the corresponding channel matrix suggest a systems and control (cs.SY) perspective. The introduction of block-restricted jamming and the analysis of its maximum error capacity relate to computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the application of the results to vehicular communication implies a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) for the transmission of audio and video data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
