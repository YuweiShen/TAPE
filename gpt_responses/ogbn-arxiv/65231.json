The paper also discusses the use of temporal coherence to improve classification accuracy, which is a common topic in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of deep architectures, which is a topic in Neural Networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with video sequences, which is a topic in Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
