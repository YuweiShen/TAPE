The focus is on recognition and classification of objects, which is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV). The use of deep metric learning is a key aspect of the proposed approach, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of active learning, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
