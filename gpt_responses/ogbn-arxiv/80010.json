The method involves solving a Newton system, which is a numerical linear algebra problem (cs.NA). The experiments are conducted on image classification tasks (cs.CV) using popular deep learning architectures (cs.AI), and the paper also discusses the computational efficiency of the method (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
