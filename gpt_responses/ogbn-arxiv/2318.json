Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the challenges of processing social media data, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The use of machine learning algorithms for NER could also fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and the use of code-switching as a linguistic phenomenon could fall under cs.CY (Computational Linguistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
