However, the focus on population-level label distribution learning and label sharing suggests that the paper is most likely to belong to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of statistical tests and approaches for label sharing also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses natural language processing (cs.CL) in the context of annotator disagreement. Finally, the proposed neighborhood-based pooling approach may fall under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
