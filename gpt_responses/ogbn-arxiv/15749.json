The most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which specifically deals with NLP and its intersection with computer science. The paper proposes novel automatic metrics for machine translation evaluation that use discourse structure and convolution kernels to compare the discourse tree of an automatic translation with that of the human reference. This involves techniques such as rhetorical structure theory and ASIYA MT evaluation toolkit, which are commonly used in NLP research. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques such as convolution kernels, which are covered by several other arXiv CS sub-categories. These include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), which deals with the development of intelligent agents and machine learning algorithms, and cs.LG (Machine Learning), which covers a broad range of topics related to machine learning and statistical modeling. \n\nThe paper also involves information retrieval techniques, such as the use of metrics to compare machine translations with human references. This is covered by cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which deals with the retrieval of information from large datasets. Finally, the paper involves the use of computational linguistics techniques, which are covered by cs.CY (Computational Linguistics), which deals with the use of computational methods to analyze and generate natural language."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
