The paper also focuses on achieving strong secrecy, which is a topic in cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of multiple access channels and the consideration of different wiretapping scenarios suggest that the paper may also fall under the categories of multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper involves the use of probability distribution approximation arguments, which is a technique commonly used in network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
