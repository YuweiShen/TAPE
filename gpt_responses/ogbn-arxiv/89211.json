The paper focuses on the integration of all meta paths and meta structures into a unified framework, which can be constructed automatically. This suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Databases (cs.DB), and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper deals with the evaluation of the proposed method through experimental evaluations, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
