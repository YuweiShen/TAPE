This involves optimizing the slicing strategy for long-term network utility without prior knowledge of traffic/utility models. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a genetic algorithm-based optimizer, which falls under the scope of evolutionary computing. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with inter-slice resource management in 5G networks, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper may involve information theory concepts in optimizing the slicing strategy for long-term network utility. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper may involve control theory concepts in managing inter-slice resources in 5G networks. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an online optimizer that requires no prior knowledge about traffic/utility models, which falls under the scope of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
