The focus on self-bounding functions and their properties suggests that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Finally, the use of noise stability and its connection to $\\ell_1$ approximation suggests that it could belong to cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
