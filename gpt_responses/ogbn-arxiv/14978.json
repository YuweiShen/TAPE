It proposes a fixed-parameter polynomial-time algorithm and parallel algorithms for solving these problems. The paper also discusses the classes of acyclic hypergraphs, hypergraphs of bounded treewidth, and hypergraphs of bounded generalized hypertree width, which are all extensively considered in the CSP setting, as well as in conjunctive database query evaluation and optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
