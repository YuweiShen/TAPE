The paper focuses on the optimization of this operation, called pack, for hyperparameter search systems. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper also discusses the impact of memory capacity and chip architecture, which suggests a possible fit for cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
