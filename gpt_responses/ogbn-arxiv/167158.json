Specifically, the paper introduces a new concept called Ramsey Spanning Trees and applies it to devise a routing scheme with improved performance. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), followed by cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
