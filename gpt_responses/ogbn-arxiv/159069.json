This topic is related to information theory (cs.IT) as it involves optimizing the transmission of information over a wireless channel. It also falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) as it deals with the design of wireless networks. The paper also discusses the physical interpretation of beamforming structures, which is related to systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper focuses on mmW systems, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a low-complexity solution for beamforming, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
