This suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of a likelihood ratio based sequential policy also suggests a connection to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). Finally, the application of the results to a visual search experiment suggests a connection to Computer Vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
