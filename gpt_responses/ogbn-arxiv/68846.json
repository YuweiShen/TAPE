The paper also discusses the use of machine learning models for building a general index, which falls under cs.CL. The paper addresses the challenge of processing large text data sets, which is a common problem in database systems (cs.DB). The paper proposes a framework that uses approximation to speed up query processing, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
