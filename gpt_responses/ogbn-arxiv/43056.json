The paper presents a probabilistic basis for fast non-destructive correction of AI systems using linear discriminants. This work is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), information theory (cs.IT), and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
