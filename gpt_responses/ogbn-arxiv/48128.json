Additionally, the paper discusses the interplay between human gaze and attention mechanisms in deep neural networks, which suggests that it may also belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel split attention model for image captioning, which involves natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
