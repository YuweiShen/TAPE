This makes it relevant to the networking and internet architecture sub-category. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new user selection scheme based on the distance of users from the base station, which can be seen as a control problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the system throughput of the proposed protocol, which is a performance metric relevant to multimedia applications. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper derives closed-form expressions for the outage probability and system throughput, which involves mathematical modeling and analysis, making it relevant to the computational engineering sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
