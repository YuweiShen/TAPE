The paper also heavily relies on computer vision techniques for pose estimation (cs.CV) and proposes a probabilistic evaluation metric that involves machine learning (cs.AI) and statistical analysis (cs.LG). Finally, the paper aims to improve the performance of robotic manipulation tasks, which is a key application of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
