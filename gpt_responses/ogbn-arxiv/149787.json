The paper also discusses the use of bit-wise decoders, which are commonly used in digital signal processing and optimization (cs.OH) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the use of low-density parity check codes, which are commonly used in networked information systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
