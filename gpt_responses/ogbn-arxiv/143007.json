However, since the paper focuses on the individualization/refinement technique, which is a common approach in graph theory and combinatorics, it is more likely to belong to cs.DM and cs.DS. Additionally, the paper mentions families of hard graphs, which suggests that it may also be relevant to cs.CG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
