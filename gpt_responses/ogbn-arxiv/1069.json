This falls under the category of computational complexity theory (cs.CC). The paper also mentions natural problems such as Minimum Equivalent Expression and determining the winner in an election system, which are typically studied in the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of game theory (cs.GT), as it discusses determining the performance of heuristic algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
