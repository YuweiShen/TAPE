This falls under the domain of machine learning, specifically tensor decomposition. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed method involves making decisions based on maximizing the \"goodness of structure\", which is a common theme in artificial intelligence. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper mentions datasets that evolve over space and/or time, which could be related to social and information networks. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a greedy algorithm for finding an optimal solution, which is a common theme in data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses different definitions of \"good structure\" and evaluates the method on real datasets without ground truth, which could be related to information theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
