The use of successive interference cancellation (SIC) also suggests a possible connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.MA). The analysis of error propagation and the derivation of closed-form expressions suggest a possible connection to networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
