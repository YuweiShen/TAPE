The paper also discusses the impact of random phase noise on channel estimation, which is a problem related to system dynamics and control (cs.SY). The proposed sequential MMSE estimator involves processing and analyzing received signals, which falls under the category of communication systems (cs.COMM). Finally, the paper presents simulation results to compare the performance of the proposed estimator, which involves statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, and hence can be related to the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
