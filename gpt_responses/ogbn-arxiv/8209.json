The use of diagrams to represent personal understanding of causal relationships between core software engineering constructs suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and social informatics (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the importance of evidence-based practice, which could be relevant to programming languages (cs.PL) and cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
