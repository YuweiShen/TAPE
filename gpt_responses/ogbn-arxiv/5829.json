The paper also discusses path planning, which is a common application of topological maps and is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper uses scanned maps, which are often processed using computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The paper also discusses segmentation approaches, which are related to machine learning and pattern recognition (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the use of the Area Graph for semantic mapping, which is related to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
