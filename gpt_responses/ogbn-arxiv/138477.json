This falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of splines and GPU acceleration, which are common in graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Additionally, the paper proposes an intuitive interface for users to tweak the output, which falls under human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper discusses theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, which are common in computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
