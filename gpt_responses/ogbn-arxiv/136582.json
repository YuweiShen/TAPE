The paper uses data from ~2.5 million articles, which suggests that it could be relevant to the sub-categories of computer science that deal with large-scale data analysis and information retrieval (cs.DL, cs.IR). Additionally, the paper's focus on citation analysis could be relevant to the sub-categories of computer science that deal with bibliometrics and scientometrics (cs.CY). The paper's use of statistical methods to analyze citation distributions could also be relevant to the sub-categories of computer science that deal with data science and machine learning (cs.SI, cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
