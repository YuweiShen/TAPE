This involves concepts from information theory (IT) and cryptography (CR). The use of random codes falls under the category of coding theory (CC). The paper also discusses examples and comparisons between different coding ensembles, which could fall under the categories of social and information networks (SI) and multimedia (MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
