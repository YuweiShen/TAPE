The method involves using interpolants, which are commonly used in program verification and synthesis (cs.PL). The paper also addresses the issue of failure to prove a property, which is a common problem in software engineering (cs.SE). The use of weak approximation and the need for an adequate set of predicates suggest a connection to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). Finally, the empirical evaluation of the method suggests a connection to machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
