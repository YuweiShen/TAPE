This involves computer vision techniques such as image processing and deep learning.\n2. cs.RO (Robotics): Needle insertion is a common task in minimally invasive interventions, which often involve robotics. The accurate measurement of needle tip force can help in detecting and compensating potential misplacement, which is important in robotic-assisted interventions.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper involves the use of an optical fiber to capture images of the deformation of an epoxy layer, which can be considered as a form of multimedia data.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel deep learning-based fused convolutional GRU-CNN model for calibration and force estimation, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves the use of machine learning techniques such as deep learning for force estimation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
