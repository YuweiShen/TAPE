This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and software engineering (cs.SE). The technology is implemented and evaluated using the Ethereum blockchain, which falls under the category of distributed systems (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the limitations of existing offline vulnerability analysis tools, which falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL). Therefore, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CR, cs.SE, cs.DC, cs.PL, and cs.Distributed Systems, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
