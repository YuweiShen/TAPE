These topics are closely related to numerical analysis. \n\n2. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the application of RBF methods to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in various engineering and science fields. \n\n3. cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper proposes a new methodology for constructing efficient RBFs in the domain-type RBF collocation method and dual reciprocity method. This methodology can be considered as a new mathematical software tool. \n\n4. cs.SC (Symbolic Computation and Formal Verification): The paper discusses the formulation of linear modeling equations for nonlinear partial differential systems with linear boundary conditions, which can be considered as a symbolic computation problem. \n\n5. cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper proposes a new boundary knot method (BKM) that is truly meshless, exponential convergence, integration-free, and boundary-only for general problems. This method can be considered as an emerging technology in the field of numerical analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
