The use of reward shaping and goal setting also falls under the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of Deep Q Learning (DQL), which is a subfield of Reinforcement Learning, and A* algorithm, which falls under the category of Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Systems and Control (cs.SY).
