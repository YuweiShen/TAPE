It specifically focuses on the functional advantages of adaptive Theory of Mind (ToM) systems in robotics and proposes future studies to create innovative computational models for an improved adaptive ToM ability in robots. This suggests that the paper belongs to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential for enhancing human-robot interactions, which falls under the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The paper also discusses the limitations of current robotic architectures and proposes future developmental pathways, which suggests that it may belong to the Learning (cs.LG) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
