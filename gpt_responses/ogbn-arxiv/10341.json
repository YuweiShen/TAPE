This involves the use of deep generative models, which is a common topic in machine learning.\n- cs.SD (Sound): Source separation is a common problem in audio signal processing, and the paper discusses the use of generative models as priors for separating sources in mixtures. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to the sound sub-category.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper provides quantitative evaluation of separation results on CIFAR-10, which is a dataset commonly used in computer vision. Additionally, the use of generative models as priors could be relevant to image generation and manipulation tasks.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of deep generative models as priors for source separation, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence. Additionally, the use of Bayesian methods and Langevin dynamics could be relevant to other AI applications.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the use of Bayesian methods and generative models for source separation, which could be relevant to information theory and signal processing. Additionally, the paper introduces new methodology for evaluating separation quality on richer datasets, which could be relevant to information theory and data analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
