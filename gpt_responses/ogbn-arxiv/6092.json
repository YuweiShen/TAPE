The paper also discusses the decoding complexity of the codes, which could be relevant to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The use of numerical simulations suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. The paper involves algebraic structures, which could be relevant to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the codes, which could be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
