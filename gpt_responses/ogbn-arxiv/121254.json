This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a semi-coupled filter-sharing network and studies methods for fusing spatial and temporal ConvNets, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses high-resolution videos during training, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Finally, the paper deals with improving recognition performance, which is related to neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
