The paper also discusses the use of underparameterization to prevent overfitting, which is a topic of interest in information theory (cs.IT) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper proposes a simple architecture for the deep decoder, which may be of interest to researchers in multimedia (cs.MM) who are interested in efficient image and video compression."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
