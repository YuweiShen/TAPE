This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The use of a supplemental set of images is a form of data augmentation, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also evaluates the proposed method on a real-world data set, which could fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR) if the data set is related to security applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
