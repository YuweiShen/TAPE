This involves both communication and heat transfer theories, indicating a focus on information theory (cs.IT) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). The analysis also considers the impact on the overall system performance, suggesting a systems and control perspective (cs.SY). Additionally, the use of mmWave massive MIMO technology implies a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
