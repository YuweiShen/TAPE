The use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the integration of the CNN into an iterative optical flow framework suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of directional filtering and similarity matrices suggests that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
