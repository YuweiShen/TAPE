The use of a controlled multi-variate Gaussian observation model and the Fisher information measure suggests that it could also belong to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The use of a suboptimal algorithm and numerical simulations suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the physical activity tracking application suggests that it could belong to the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
