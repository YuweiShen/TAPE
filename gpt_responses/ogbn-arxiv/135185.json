This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and coding theory (cs.DS, cs.DC, cs.CC). The paper also discusses the concept of edit distance tree codes, which is a novel primitive, and this could potentially fall under the category of cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
