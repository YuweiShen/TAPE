The proposed spreading sequences scheme and detection algorithm are based on belief propagation, which is a popular technique in statistical inference (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the information capacity of the system, which is a topic in data storage (cs.DS). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT and cs.NI, followed by cs.SI, cs.DS, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
