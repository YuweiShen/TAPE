The focus on tractable models suggests a strong connection to the subfield of probabilistic programming and inference, which is often categorized under cs.LG and cs.AI. The use of image datasets and embeddings suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL), while the mention of polynomial time computation suggests a connection to complexity theory and systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
