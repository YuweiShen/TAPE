The use of queueing theory and optimization techniques suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of networked systems (cs.NI), information theory (cs.IT), and control systems (cs.SY). The focus on decentralized scheduling and reduced state information suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of distributed computing (cs.DC) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
