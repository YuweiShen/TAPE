The paper proposes a novel pairwise similarity measure that is integrated with deep convolutional neural networks for feature representation learning. The paper evaluates the proposed method on several challenging cross-domain matching tasks, including person re-identification and face verification. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
