Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes an approximation algorithm with a running time that depends on the dimension of the space, which suggests that it could also be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The use of approximation algorithms and the focus on improving the running time could also make it relevant to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
