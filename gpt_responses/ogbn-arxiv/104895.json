Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also introduces correlation features and uses a multi-task objective, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. The use of track regression and tracklets indicates that it may also be relevant to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the evaluation on a large-scale dataset suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
