The paper proposes a new approach called Batch Noise Contrastive Estimation (B-NCE) to train large vocabulary NNLMs. This approach involves reducing the vocabulary at each time step and replacing the softmax function with noise contrastive estimation. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related topics. The paper also involves optimization techniques and matrix operations, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper uses a GPU for training, which is relevant to sub-categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
