The paper proposes a novel optimization procedure for this problem, which involves searching for binary bases via a MAXCUT-like boolean quadratic solver. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures (cs.DS), and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
