The paper also proposes a pseudo metric to analyze the trade-off between the error bound and the dynamic range for robust CRT, which involves numerical analysis (cs.NA) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents the first robust CRT for multiple numbers to solve the problem of the CRT-based undersampling frequency estimation in general cases, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and optimization (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
