The study involves a large-scale practical examination of relying party (RP) websites, which suggests that there may be issues with the implementation of OpenID Connect in real-world systems. This could also fall under the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE) as it involves examining the design decisions made by RP developers. Additionally, the paper discusses practical recommendations for improving the security of OpenID Connect systems, which could fall under the categories of cyber security (cs.CY) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the study involves a forensic examination of RP websites, which could also fall under the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
