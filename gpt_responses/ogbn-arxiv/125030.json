The paper also compares two specific semantic schemes, Universal Dependencies (UD) and UCCA, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential downstream applications of semantic parsing, which could be relevant to the sub-categories of natural language processing (cs.NE) and software engineering (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
