The use of self-supervised learning and view synthesis also suggests a focus on computer vision. The robotics (cs.RO) sub-category is also likely as depth estimation is important for robot navigation and manipulation. The use of loss functions and training methods suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of occlusion as a key challenge in depth estimation suggests a possible connection to graphics (cs.GR) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
