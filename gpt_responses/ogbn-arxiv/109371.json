It also involves the use of multiple antennas and scattering, which are relevant to wireless communication networks (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper may also be relevant to multimedia systems (cs.MM) and communication engineering (cs.CE) due to its focus on channel performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
