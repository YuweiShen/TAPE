This work involves combining multiple symbolic representations obtained using different parameters and domains, and adapting a symbolic sequence classifier to work with multiple domain representations. These topics are closely related to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data mining (cs.DM), information retrieval (cs.IR), and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
