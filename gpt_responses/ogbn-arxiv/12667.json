This involves optimizing the check node degree distribution to achieve near-capacity performance for a wide range of SNRs. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed rateless code is designed for wireless channels, which are a key component of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart based optimization approach to obtain a robust check node degree distribution, which can be seen as a control problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed rateless code can be used for multimedia transmission over wireless channels, which often suffer from high error rates. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly discuss cryptography or security, but the proposed rateless code could potentially be used in secure communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
