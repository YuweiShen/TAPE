This falls under the scope of systems and control. \n- cs.ME (Mechanical Engineering): The paper focuses on parameterized simple mechanical systems and considers an application to nonlinear structural dynamics. This falls under the scope of mechanical engineering. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes efficient techniques for approximating parameterized reduced matrices while preserving symmetry and positive definiteness. This falls under the scope of numerical analysis. \n- cs.DS (Dynamical Systems): The paper deals with the dynamics of mechanical systems and proposes a methodology for model reduction while preserving key properties such as energy conservation and symplectic time-evolution maps. This falls under the scope of dynamical systems. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a computational methodology for model reduction of mechanical systems and considers an application to nonlinear structural dynamics.
