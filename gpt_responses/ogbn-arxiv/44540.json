The paper focuses on reducing computation costs without performance damage, which is a common goal in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of neural architecture search also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper involves optimization and tuning of network parameters, which could fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
