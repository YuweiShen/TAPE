The paper also discusses the study of program properties and consistency, which are topics related to logic (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also introduces a novel graph-like representation of programs, which is related to data structures (cs.DS) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
