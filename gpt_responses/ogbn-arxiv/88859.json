The paper also discusses the formalization of adversarial error and decoder failure, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR). The use of message authentication codes (MACs) and Reed-Solomon codes suggests that the paper may also be relevant to network security (cs.NI) and system theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper's discussion of open problems for future work suggests that it may also be relevant to the field of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
