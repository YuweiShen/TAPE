The use of quality measures for model parameters is a statistical approach, which falls under machine learning and data analysis. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SD (Sound), followed by cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with system combination and performance evaluation, which are relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SDQ (Sound and Music Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
