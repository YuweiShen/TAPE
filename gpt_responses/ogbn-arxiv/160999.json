This involves designing beamforming and channel-feedback techniques for multi-function AirComp. The paper also discusses the optimization of receive-beamforming for multi-function AirComp, which is a NP-hard problem. Given the focus on wireless communication and network optimization, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also deals with smart-city surveillance and environment monitoring, which suggests a possible fit with cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
