This is a machine learning problem and falls under the scope of cs.LG. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method to improve the performance of GATs, which is a popular neural architecture for representation learning with graphs. This falls under the scope of cs.AI, which covers research on various aspects of artificial intelligence. \n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper discusses the over-smoothing behavior of GATs, which is a common problem in graph-based models used in computer vision. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to researchers working in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition. \n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper proposes a method to improve the performance of GATs, which can be applied to various natural language processing tasks that involve graph-based models. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to researchers working in the field of computation and language. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a method to address the weaknesses of GATs, which is a neural architecture for representation learning with graphs.
