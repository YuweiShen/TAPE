Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses complexity results, which suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The paper also mentions graph theory, which could fall under cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). Finally, the paper briefly mentions Kandinsky drawings, which are a type of graph drawing, and could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
