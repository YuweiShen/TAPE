Additionally, the use of deep learning methods such as fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) and the fusion of multimodal data also suggest that it could belong to the cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.NE sub-categories. Finally, the application of these techniques to robotics and autonomous vehicles suggests that it could also belong to the cs.RO sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
