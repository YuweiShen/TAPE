The use of dense bipartite graphs is a key technical innovation in the paper, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of graph theory (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper involves designing codes that can handle multiple read requests in parallel, which is a problem that falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC). The use of explicit and deterministic decoding algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper involves optimizing tradeoffs between various parameters, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
