The use of multiple antennas suggests a possible connection to the Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) subfield (cs.MM). The mention of channel-state information and pilot-based transmission suggests a possible connection to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) subfields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
