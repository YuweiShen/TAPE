It may also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category as the algorithm is trained on electrocardiograms. Additionally, it could be categorized under computational engineering (cs.CE) as it involves the development of a model to solve a specific problem in the medical field. The use of neural networks also suggests it could belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the involvement of board-certified cardiologists in annotating the gold standard test set suggests it could also belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
