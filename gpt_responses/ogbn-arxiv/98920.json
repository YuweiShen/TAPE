The proposed technique is specifically designed to address the challenges of high action-dimensional tasks and reusing old samples, which are common issues in reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories for this paper are machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
