It also involves machine learning techniques such as LSTM and FPL, which are commonly used in computer vision applications. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of adaptive online learning, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also involves robotics (cs.RO) as it deals with predicting human movement, which is relevant to robotics applications. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with video scenes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
