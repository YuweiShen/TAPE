The use of Discrete Fourier Transform theory suggests that the paper may also belong to the information theory (cs.IT) category. The generation of structures involves the application of kernels and homogenization theory, which are related to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
