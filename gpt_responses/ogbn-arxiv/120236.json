This algorithm is designed to exploit uncertain samples predicted inconsistently in recent iterations. The paper extensively evaluates the proposed method on two independent tasks and compares it with existing batch selection methods. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
