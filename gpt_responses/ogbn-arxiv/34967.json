It proposes a methodology to capture the latent structure of media's decision process on a large scale. The paper uses personalization techniques to predict media coverage and evaluates its approach on a large set of events collected from the GDELT database. The paper also proposes a method to select a set of sources by leveraging the latent representation. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing), and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
