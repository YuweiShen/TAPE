The paper considers the spatiotemporal conflicts and competing events, which are typical problems in social network analysis.\n- cs.DS: The paper mentions that the SES problem is strongly NP-hard, which implies that it involves computational complexity and algorithmic design, both of which are core topics in data structures.\n- cs.CE: The paper mentions the expected gains of social events, such as revenue and artist/brand publicity, which are typical concerns in business and economics. The scheduling of events can also be seen as a resource allocation problem, which is a common topic in computer engineering.\n- cs.DB: The paper uses a real dataset to evaluate the proposed method, which involves data management and analysis, both of which are core topics in database systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
