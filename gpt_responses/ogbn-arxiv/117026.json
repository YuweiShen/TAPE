The paper specifically focuses on secure distributed matrix multiplication, which involves multiple servers and communication overhead. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the categories of cryptography (cs.CR), information theory (cs.IT), distributed computing (cs.DC), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
