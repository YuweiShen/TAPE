The paper also focuses on improving training and testing speed while increasing detection accuracy, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep neural networks also suggests a possible connection to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the implementation of the method in Python and C++ using Caffe suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
