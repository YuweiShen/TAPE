The paper also discusses the use of various ML algorithms such as random forests, decision trees, and support vector machines, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of ML in mapping and detection, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of ML in predicting fire behavior, which requires computational modeling (cs.CE) and the use of high-performance computing (cs.DC).
