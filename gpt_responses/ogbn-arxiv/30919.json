This involves cryptographic techniques to ensure the fingerprints are secure and cannot be easily removed or modified. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper is focused on deep learning and proposes a methodology for systematic fingerprinting in the context of deep learning. The proposed framework embeds fingerprints in the probability density function of trainable weights in deep neural networks. \n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper evaluates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework on image datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR10, which are commonly used in computer vision research. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed framework can be applied to protect multimedia models such as image and video classifiers, which are commonly used in multimedia applications. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel framework for protecting the intellectual property of deep learning models, which are a key component of artificial intelligence systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
