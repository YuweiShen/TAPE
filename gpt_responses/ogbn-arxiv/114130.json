It also talks about the challenges faced by the industry when adopting Cloud computing as a mainstream technology, which is a common topic in the distributed computing field.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper mentions the Cloudbus toolkit, which provides tools and platforms for optimizing the cost and time of applications. This is relevant to the computational finance and science fields, where efficient and cost-effective computing is crucial.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the development of various tools and platforms by Cloudbus, which can be used individually or together as an integrated solution. This is relevant to the software engineering field, where the development of tools and platforms is a common research topic.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper talks about the utility-oriented Cloud vision, which is a generic model for realizing market-oriented Cloud computing. This is relevant to the networking and internet architecture field, where the design and implementation of utility-oriented systems is a common research topic.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper mentions experiments conducted using the Cloudbus toolkit, which can provide applications based on deadline and manage real-world problems through an integrated solution.
