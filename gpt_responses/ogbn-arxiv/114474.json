The use of a neural network to represent object shape suggests a potential application in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the design of the network, which involves an understanding of physical laws, indicating a potential fit for machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
