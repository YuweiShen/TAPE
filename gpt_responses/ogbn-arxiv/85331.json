The proposed approach involves determining the confidence from the convolution operation and propagating it to consecutive layers, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also investigates fusion strategies to combine depth and RGB information, which is relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper proposes an objective function that simultaneously minimizes the data error while maximizing the output confidence, which is a common problem in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
