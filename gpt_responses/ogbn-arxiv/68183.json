The paper proposes a new method for salient object detection using hybrid contrast-oriented deep neural networks, which involves training and fine-tuning pre-trained models (cs.AI), and the use of attentional modules (cs.LG) and fully connected CRF models (cs.MM) for post-processing. The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed method in terms of evaluation metrics (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
