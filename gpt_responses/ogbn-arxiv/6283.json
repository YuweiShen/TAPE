This involves casting the graph optimization problem as distance metric learning to capture pairwise similarities of features in each layer. The proposed method is evaluated on point clouds and citation network datasets, which are commonly studied in the fields of machine learning and computer vision. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper proposes a novel method for graph learning, it may also be relevant to the sub-categories cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
