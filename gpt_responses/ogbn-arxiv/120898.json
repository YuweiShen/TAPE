The paper proposes a bandit algorithm to maximize local (and thus global) influence and provides its theoretical analysis. This problem is related to social networks, data mining, and machine learning, which are the main topics covered in the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category. The paper also involves graph theory and algorithms, which are covered in the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The paper discusses the stochastic block models and Chung-Lu models, which are probabilistic models of random graphs, and their sub-critical and super-critical regimes, which are covered in the cs.SOC (Social and Economic Networks) sub-category. The paper proposes a bandit algorithm, which is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm, covered in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with optimization and decision-making, which are covered in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
