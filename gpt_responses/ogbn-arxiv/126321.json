This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of computer science that deal with data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper involves Fourier analysis, which is a common tool in information theory (cs.IT) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper also involves graph theory (cs.GT), which is relevant to the problem of MAX-CUT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
