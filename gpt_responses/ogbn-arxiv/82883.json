As such, it is likely to fall under the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel convolution filter and corresponding operations for spherical surface data, which could also be relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Finally, the paper deals with the specific application of cortical surface parcellation and cortical attribute map development prediction, which could be relevant to the Graphics (cs.GR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
