Therefore, the most likely category is cs.ET (Emerging Technologies), which covers research on new and innovative technologies for computing and communication. The paper also involves complexity theory, as it proves that determining an optimal embedding is coNP-hard, which suggests a possible fit with cs.AR (Computational Complexity) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Moreover, the use of sums of products and binary decision diagrams as function representations suggests a connection with cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
