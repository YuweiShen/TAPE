Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also mentions the potential benefits of 3D beamforming for cell-splitting and user-specific beamforming, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) and system (cs.SY) aspects. Finally, the paper discusses the need for accurate 3D channel models, which could involve natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
