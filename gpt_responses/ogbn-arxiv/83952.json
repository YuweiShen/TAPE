The paper also discusses the transmission of private classical information, which is related to classical cryptography (cs.CR). The use of position-based decoding and convex-split lemma suggests that the paper may also be relevant to coding theory (cs.CC) and mathematical physics (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
