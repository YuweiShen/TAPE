The focus on simplicity and robustness suggests a possible sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). The measurement of quality in terms of interactions and states per node suggests a possible sub-category of Information Theory (cs.IT). The global task of determining the majority opinion suggests a possible sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS).
