Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.SY (Systems and Control) are likely sub-categories. The paper also focuses on the use of multiple antennas at user terminals, which falls under the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper involves optimizing the use of transmission resources, which is related to game theory and falls under the sub-category cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
