The paper discusses the use of keyword-based delegable proofs of storage, which can be used to audit specific data files containing a particular keyword. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including cryptography (cs.CR), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), databases (cs.DB), distributed computing (cs.DC), and software engineering (cs.SE). However, given the focus on security and cryptography, cs.CR is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.DS and cs.DB."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
