The paper proposes improved opportunistic scheduling and beamforming schemes based on geometric mean decomposition-based channel decomposition, which involves signal processing and information theory. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.SI (Signal Processing). The paper also involves numerical simulations, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
