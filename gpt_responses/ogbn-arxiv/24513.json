Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is the most likely category. The paper specifically discusses the application of precision highway in convolutional and recurrent neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.LG) tasks, respectively. Additionally, the paper provides a quantitative analysis of the benefit of precision highway, which is related to performance evaluation (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also discusses the overhead on hardware accelerators, which is related to computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
