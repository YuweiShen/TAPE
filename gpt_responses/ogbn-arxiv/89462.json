This clearly falls under the domain of computer vision. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a neural network-based approach for localisation, which falls under the domain of machine learning. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an AI-based approach for localisation using neural networks. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the development of a real-time localisation system for autonomous mining vehicles, which falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
