Therefore, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the power of postselection in quantum computing, which suggests cs.QC (Quantum Computing) as the second likely sub-category. The paper also looks at space-bounded classes, which falls under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms).
