This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and computer security (cs.CR). The proposed method involves the use of iterative algorithms and adversarial masks, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.MM), deep learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
