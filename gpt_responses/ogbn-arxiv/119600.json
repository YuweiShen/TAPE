This problem falls under the scope of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel algorithm that utilizes the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm combined with expectation maximization (EM) method, which falls under the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of the proposed approach when applied to the general Gaussian channel and mmWave channel, which falls under the networked systems (cs.NI) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
