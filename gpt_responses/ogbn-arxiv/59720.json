The proposed method involves learning a nonlinear mapping function, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of real-world data, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) or information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
