The paper implements an I/O cache scheme using an open-source I/O cache module in Linux operating system, which falls under the category of Architecture (cs.AR) and Operating Systems (cs.OS). Finally, the paper investigates the impact of power outage and high temperature faults on the reliability of I/O cache, which can be considered as a system-level analysis (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
