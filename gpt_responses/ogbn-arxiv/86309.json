The use of state sequences and pre-cancellation techniques suggests a possible connection to control and systems theory (cs.SY). The mention of ergodic fading processes and limited feedback rates may also indicate a link to multimedia (cs.MM) and networking (cs.NI) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
