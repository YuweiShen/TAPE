This involves optimizing the transfer of information and energy, which is a key area of research in information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with wireless interference and proposes a new scheme for exploiting constructive interference among users in the downlink. This is a key area of research in networking and internet architecture, particularly in the context of wireless networks.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a new precoding design that takes into account both QoS and energy harvesting constraints. This involves designing a system that can control the transfer of information and energy in a power-efficient manner, which is a key area of research in systems and control.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the transfer of information and energy in the context of wireless communication, which is a key area of research in multimedia. The proposed scheme could have applications in multimedia communication systems that require both high data rates and energy efficiency.\n5. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) - The paper deals with the optimization of a system that involves multiple users and conflicting objectives (QoS and energy harvesting"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
