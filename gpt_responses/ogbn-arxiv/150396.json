Specifically, it proposes a new meta-learning algorithm that merges ideas from one-shot approaches with iterative techniques for learning low-degree sparse Boolean polynomial functions. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
