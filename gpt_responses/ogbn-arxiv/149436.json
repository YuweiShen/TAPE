The proposed method involves regularization and ensembling of classifiers, which are techniques commonly used in the sub-fields of machine learning such as deep learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and data science (cs.DS). Additionally, the method involves the use of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which is a popular optimization algorithm in neural networks and other machine learning models. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.DS, and cs.NE (neural and evolutionary computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
