The paper focuses on the application of load planning problem in intermodal container booking decisions. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics and Control). Additionally, the paper deals with large datasets and sampling methods, which makes cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper also addresses computational efficiency, which makes cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
