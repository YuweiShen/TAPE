It could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it evaluates established methods and identifies guidelines for strong cross-lingual embeddings. Additionally, it involves the use of triangulation to expand the evaluation dictionary collection, which could fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also discusses the impact of hub language on downstream performance, which could relate to Information Retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the creation of new dictionaries for under-represented languages could involve Computer Vision (cs.CV) techniques for data collection and annotation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
