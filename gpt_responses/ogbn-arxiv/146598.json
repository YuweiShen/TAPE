Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel method to assess the quality of NMT systems, which involves measuring the probability of a reference translation under a NMT model compared to a contrastive translation with specific errors. This method involves machine learning and statistical analysis, which could fall under the categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the performance of different NMT models, which could fall under the categories of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) as these fields often use similar machine learning techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
