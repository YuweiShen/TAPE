The paper also involves a fine spectral analysis of the certificate used in previous works, which involves tools from information theory (cs.IT) and combinatorics (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper deals with the symmetries in the eigenspaces of set symmetric matrices, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
