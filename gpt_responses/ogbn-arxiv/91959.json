The use of sample mining and attention mechanisms also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of video-based person re-identification benchmarks suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of fine-grained visual categorisation datasets suggests that it may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
