The use of coinductive methods and the connection to abstract GSOS suggest a focus on formal methods (cs.FL) and theoretical computer science (cs.THEORY). Finally, the study of infinite sequences and their operations could also fall under the category of data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
