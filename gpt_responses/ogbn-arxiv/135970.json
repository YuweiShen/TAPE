The paper also discusses the use of probabilistic modeling and weakly-supervised learning, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions markerless performance-driven facial animation, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the techniques in human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
