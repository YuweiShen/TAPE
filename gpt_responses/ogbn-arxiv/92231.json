The paper also discusses black-box attacks, which fall under the category of computer security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper proposes novel ensemble-based approaches for generating transferable adversarial examples, which could be considered as a sub-topic of neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
