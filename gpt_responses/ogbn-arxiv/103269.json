This is a problem that is relevant to several areas of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also provides a systematic comparison with existing methods, which is a common practice in machine learning and related fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
