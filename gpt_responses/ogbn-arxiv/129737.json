Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also focuses on the Quality of Experience (QoE) of users, which falls under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper proposes an efficient scheduling approach, which involves the use of metrics to control packet transmission rate, which could be categorized under cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the reduction of packet loss and delays, which could be categorized under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
