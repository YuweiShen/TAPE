This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG the most likely category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed method involves using an Empirical Bayes approach to compute a hierarchical prior, which is a common technique in Bayesian inference and artificial intelligence.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the challenges of optimizing over sparse data, which is a common problem in data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.ST (Statistics): The paper uses statistical techniques such as Empirical Bayes to improve the performance of the model.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the use of information theory to improve the performance of the model by focusing on learning first order weights first."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
