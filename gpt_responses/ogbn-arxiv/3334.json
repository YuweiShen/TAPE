Additionally, the method involves regularization, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The method also involves reducing the precision of the weights, which suggests that it may be relevant to the numerical optimization (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves experiments on benchmark datasets, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
