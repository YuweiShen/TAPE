This involves a mathematical model for computation resource allocation (CRA) in CC, which is a key aspect of the proposed strategy. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves optimization and algorithm design, which could place it in the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a strategy for resource allocation, which could also place it in the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
