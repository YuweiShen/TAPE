The paper also discusses the use of directional antennas to improve coverage, which is related to information theory (cs.IT). The placement of the UAVs and the optimization of coverage can be considered as control and optimization problems, respectively, which fall under the categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
