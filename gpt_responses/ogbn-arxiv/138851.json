The paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture called MEDRES that uses multiple graph-CNN to exploit the complex interactions between users and items. The paper also introduces a new metric called pAp@k that is critical for classification+ranking scenarios. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
