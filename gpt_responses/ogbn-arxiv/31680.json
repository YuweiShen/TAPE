This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel loss function and uses skip connections, which are common techniques in deep learning (cs.LG and cs.AI). The use of convolutional blocks and feature extraction also suggests the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed method on a dataset indicates the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
