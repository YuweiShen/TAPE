This approach is applied to an original dataset of abstracts presented at a major oncology research conference, and is able to detect significant temporal patterns and identify major thematic transformations. Based on this description, the paper could potentially belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
