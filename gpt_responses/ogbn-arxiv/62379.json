This involves optimization and control of communication systems, which falls under the category of Information Theory (cs.IT). The use of wireless backhaul also involves networking and communication technologies, which falls under the category of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). The problem of admission control in such a network involves system-level optimization and control, which falls under the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY). The paper also mentions simulations, which may involve multimedia technologies (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes algorithms for solving the optimization problem, which may involve machine learning and optimization techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
