The concept of detection error is also relevant to signal processing and machine learning, which fall under cs.SI and cs.MM respectively. The comparison with the I-MMSE relationship suggests a connection to estimation theory, which is a subfield of cs.NI. Finally, the use of waterfilling techniques is common in optimization problems, which are studied in cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
