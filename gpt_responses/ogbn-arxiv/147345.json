Additionally, the use of alerts and filtering out false positives is a common problem in security. The paper also employs machine learning techniques such as tree-based models and embedding-based models, which are commonly used in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also deals with temporal and content correlations, which are relevant to the sub-categories of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) and Software Engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
