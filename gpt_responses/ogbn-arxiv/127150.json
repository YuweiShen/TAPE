Additionally, the use of term graphs in automated theorem proving and symbolic computation systems suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL) and data structures (cs.DS). The modeling of biological or chemical abstract machines also suggests a connection to scientific computing (cs.SC). Finally, the application issues of term graph transformation suggest a connection to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
