The paper proposes a novel approach for managing corrupted training samples in tracking-by-detection frameworks. This involves estimating the quality of the samples and down-weighting the corrupted ones while increasing the impact of correct ones. This approach involves machine learning techniques such as loss minimization and sample weighting, which are commonly used in computer vision and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
