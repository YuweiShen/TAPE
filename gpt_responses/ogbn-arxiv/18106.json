The paper also utilizes LiDAR point clouds to perform mapping and positioning, which is related to computer vision (cs.CV). The paper employs state-of-the-art graph-based optimization to integrate LiDAR odometry measurements, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper aims to improve the reliability of autonomous driving, which is a significant application in the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
