The use of reconfigurable logic devices for confidentiality and upgradability purposes suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of computer architecture (cs.AR). The evaluation of the security features of Intel MAX 10 devices suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of embedded systems (cs.ET) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper's focus on the security aspects of FPGAs suggests that it may also be relevant to the field of formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
