The focus on authentication also suggests the cyber security (cs.CY) sub-category. The use of encoding and decoding techniques suggests the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category. Finally, the mention of composition with other protocols suggests the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category, which often deals with combining different algorithms and models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
