The use of a superior estimator as a role model also involves the concept of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and the optimization of the estimator can be seen as a problem in convex optimization (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of the role model strategy in low complexity decoder design, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
