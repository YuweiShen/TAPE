This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper deals with DC microgrids, which are an emerging technology in the field of power systems. \n- cs.PF (Power and Energy): The paper focuses on current sharing and voltage balancing in DC microgrids, which are important aspects of power and energy management in microgrids.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper uses simulations and experiments to validate the theoretical results, which involves computational engineering.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): Although the paper does not explicitly deal with distributed computing, the concept of distributed generation units with decentralized primary controllers can be seen as a form of distributed computing in the context of microgrids."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
