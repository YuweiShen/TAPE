It may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category as the authors develop a heuristic approach for plan recognition. The paper also involves Robotics (cs.RO) as it discusses the applicability of planning landmarks in robotics. Additionally, it may belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) category as it refines an existing planning-based plan recognition approach. Finally, it may belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) category as it discusses the use of landmarks in planning literature."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
