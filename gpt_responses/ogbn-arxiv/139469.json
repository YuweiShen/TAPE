The use of hierarchical correlation reconstruction and polynomial estimation is a novel approach that falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and statistics (cs.ST). The paper also discusses the use of different distributions than Gaussian, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the application of the approach to non-stationary time series, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
