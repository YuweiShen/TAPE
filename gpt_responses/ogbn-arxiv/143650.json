The paper proposes a new benchmark dataset for training and evaluating models for few-shot classification. The paper also experiments with popular baselines and meta-learners on the proposed dataset. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) tasks, which are closely related to few-shot classification. The paper also proposes a new method for few-shot classification, which falls under the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
