It also involves the use of deep neural networks, which is a common technique in computer vision research. Additionally, the paper may also fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as it deals with analyzing images retrieved from the web. Information retrieval (cs.IR) is another possible sub-category as the paper involves querying search engines to collect images. Machine learning (cs.LG) is also a likely sub-category as the paper uses deep neural networks for facial expression recognition. Finally, human-computer interaction (cs.HC) is a possible sub-category as the paper deals with recognizing facial expressions, which is an important aspect of human communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
