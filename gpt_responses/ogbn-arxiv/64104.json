The most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), as the paper focuses on the design and optimization of communication systems. The second likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), as the paper discusses the use of large antenna arrays for 5G wireless communications. The third likely category is cs.MM (Multimedia), as the paper discusses the use of millimeter-wave frequencies for high-bandwidth multimedia applications. The fourth likely category is cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), as the paper discusses the hardware requirements and challenges of implementing large antenna arrays. The fifth likely category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), as the paper discusses the design and optimization of hybrid precoding systems for millimeter-wave MIMO."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
