This is a classic topic in game theory and falls under the scope of cs.GT. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper models actions that change uncertainty about preferences, such as a voter revealing her preference. This is a common topic in AI research, particularly in the area of decision-making under uncertainty. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a logic to formalize epistemic voting terminology. This is a common technique in machine learning for modeling uncertainty and reasoning about complex systems. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses scenarios where the profile of true preferences is the same but the equilibrium profiles are different, because the voters have different knowledge about other voters. This involves analyzing and manipulating data structures and algorithms to determine optimal voting strategies. \n5. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper deals with strategic voting in a setting where a voter may lack knowledge about the preferences of other voters. This is a classic problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must reason about the beliefs and actions of other agents in order to make optimal decisions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
