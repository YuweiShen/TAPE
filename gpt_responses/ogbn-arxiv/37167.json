The paper also discusses algorithms for solving these problems, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The use of multimorphisms and submodular functions suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the fields of machine learning (cs.LG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
