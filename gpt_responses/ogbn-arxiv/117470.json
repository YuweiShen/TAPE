The authors also discuss the limitations of current methods and propose a new approach, which involves mapping 2D joint locations to 3D positions, indicating a potential application of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in this field. Additionally, the paper involves graph representation of human poses, which falls under computer graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the authors evaluate their approach on a publicly available dataset, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
