The proposed algorithm involves optimization using a nonlinear cost function, which is a topic of interest in information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of an efficient projection scheme is also a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
