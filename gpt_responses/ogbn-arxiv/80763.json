The paper also provides a complexity dichotomy for a related problem. These topics are typically studied in the sub-categories of computer science related to algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, graph theory, and computational geometry. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS, cs.CC, cs.DM, cs.GT, and cs.CG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
