The paper also mentions the use of CNN and LSTM models, which are commonly used in computer vision and natural language processing, respectively. Therefore, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.CV are likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of multiple sensor signals, which could fall under the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SP) or neural engineering (cs.NE). Finally, the paper proposes a novel fusion method using backward shortcut connections, which could fall under the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
