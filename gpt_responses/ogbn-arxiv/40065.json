This involves planning and control of robotic manipulators, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also mentions the use of computer vision techniques for object recognition and pose estimation, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The approach also involves using task goals for efficient manipulation planning, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper presents experiments with a physical robot, which involves system integration and control, falling under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
