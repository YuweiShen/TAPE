It may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it discusses neural sentence composition models. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it deals with natural language processing and understanding. The paper's use of a specialized sentence generation system may also make it relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing).
