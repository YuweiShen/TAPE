The paper discusses qualitative and quantitative evaluations of word embeddings trained from different resources. The paper also discusses the performance of word embeddings on downstream biomedical NLP tasks. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
