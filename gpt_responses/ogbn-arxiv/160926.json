This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of multi-level voxel grids and the proposed multi-level learning approach also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and graphics (cs.GR). Additionally, the potential applications of the proposed approach in robotics (cs.RO) are mentioned in the abstract."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
