Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely categories. The paper also proposes a bi-directional RNN with an attentive mechanism, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (AI) research. Hence, cs.AI is also a likely category. The paper deals with video content, which falls under the multimedia (MM) category. Finally, the paper proposes a hierarchical architecture that models video content with multiple granularities, which is a machine learning (LG) technique."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
