The paper proposes an algorithm that is based on the Langevin equation with stochastic gradients and extends it using the Bayesian Central Limit Theorem. This makes it likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), statistics (cs.ST), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
