The use of statistical and semantic-based features suggests that the paper may fall under the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper addresses the problem of information overload, which is a common issue in information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML). Therefore, the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of IR (cs.IR), ML (cs.LG), AI (cs.AI), and DL (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
