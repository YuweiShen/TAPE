Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper proposes a new approach for fusing stacked layers, which involves designing three fusion functions. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper uses experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which may indicate that it is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
