The proposed method involves utilizing the maximum of block-level GEs on the frame, which is a technique related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments are carried out on multiple datasets, which is a characteristic of multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper also discusses the limitations of existing methods, which is a topic related to computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
