Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses various candidate fronthaul technologies, including optical fiber, millimeter-wave based unlicensed spectrum, Wi-Fi based unlicensed spectrum, sub 6GHz based licensed spectrum, and free-space optical based unlicensed spectrum, which are related to information theory (cs.IT), communication (cs.COMM), and applied physics (cs.AR). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of millimeter-wave technology, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
