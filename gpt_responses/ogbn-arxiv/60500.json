The proposed method involves aggregating information from potential correspondences, which is related to multi-modal fusion (cs.MM) and attention mechanisms (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the robustness of the model to errors in proposals, which is relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and computer graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
