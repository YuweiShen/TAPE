The paper discusses the challenges of developing deep GCNs and proposes a solution called DropEdge. The paper also explores the application of DropEdge to recast Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) from the image field to the graph domain. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
