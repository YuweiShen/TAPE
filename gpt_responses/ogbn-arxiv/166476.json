This topic is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the use of neural networks, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper suggests future research directions, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
