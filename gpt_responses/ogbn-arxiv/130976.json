Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses privacy-relevant characteristics of NDN, which falls under the category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper proposes an NDN add-on tool that borrows features from Tor, which falls under the category of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also discusses the semantic richness of names in NDN, which falls under the category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper proposes a privacy solution for NDN, which falls under the category of cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
