This could be seen as a logical aspect of computer science. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper is about functional reactive programming, which is a programming paradigm. The categorical models developed in the paper could be seen as a way to reason about and analyze programs written in this paradigm. \n- cs.CT (Category Theory): The paper develops categorical models of functional reactive programming, which is a topic that naturally falls under category theory. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper is about a programming paradigm and its semantics, which could be seen as relevant to software engineering. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper deals with the semantics of a programming paradigm, which could be seen as a formal language. The categorical models developed in the paper could be seen as a way to reason about and analyze this language."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
