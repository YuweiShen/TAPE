This involves topics related to information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), control and systems engineering (cs.SY), multimedia (cs.MM), and machine learning (cs.LG) as the authors propose a partially observed Markov decision process and use perturbation analysis and semidefinite relaxation techniques to solve the problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
