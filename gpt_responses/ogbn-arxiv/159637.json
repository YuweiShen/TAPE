The focus on state aggregation and feature reinforcement learning suggests that the paper may fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of (q-)value functions and optimal policies suggests a connection to decision making and control systems (cs.SY). The mention of a generalized approach that holds uniformly for all RL problems suggests a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the mention of efficient solving or learning suggests a connection to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
