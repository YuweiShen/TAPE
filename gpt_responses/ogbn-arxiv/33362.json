The focus on regularization methods and overfitting suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the use of benchmark datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR10 suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
