The paper discusses the use of subword-level representations (character and character n-gram) in sentence pair modeling tasks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of neural models for these tasks, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of different models, which could place it in the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe paper also discusses achieving state-of-the-art results, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper discusses paraphrase identification, which is a task related to information retrieval, suggesting that it could also belong to the sub-category cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
