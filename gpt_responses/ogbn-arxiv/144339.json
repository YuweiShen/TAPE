The use of Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning and the focus on agent-based task planning also suggests that it could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA) sub-categories. The mention of social rules and behavior also suggests that it could belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category.
