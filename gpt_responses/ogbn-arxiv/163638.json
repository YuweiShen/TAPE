The paper also involves eye-tracking data, which suggests a human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a combined model of traditional saliency and a vanishing point channel, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the performance of the model using three scores, which suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves studying the effect of a particular type of scene structural information, which suggests a neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
