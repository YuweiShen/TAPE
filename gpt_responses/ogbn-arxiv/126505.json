The paper also discusses security and attacks, which are studied in the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of targeted service provision to prevent chosen nodes from providing service is a networking issue, which is studied in the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also discusses techniques for limiting the damage of attacks, which is a systems issue, studied in the Systems and Control (cs.SI) sub-category.
