The use of non-negative least squares (NNLS) is a popular approach for this problem, and the paper builds upon recent results from [1] to show that NNLS can achieve compressed sensing recovery guarantees without requiring tuning parameters that depend on the noise level. This makes the paper relevant to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Signal Processing (cs.SP), Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
