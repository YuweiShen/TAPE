This involves analyzing statistical relationships intrinsic to power system parameters, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also addresses the issue of malicious activity, which suggests a focus on security (cs.CR). The proposed method involves machine learning, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of statistical relationships and analysis of power system parameters also suggests a focus on networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
