The use of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework suggests that the paper could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The creation of a 3D map using images captured by agents suggests that the paper could also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The evaluation of the framework in terms of effectiveness in tracking random dynamicity of the environment suggests that the paper could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the involvement of agents in capturing images and building a 3D map suggests that the paper could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
