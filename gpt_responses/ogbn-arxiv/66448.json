The paper proposes a fast multiscale procedure for compressing Markov decision processes (MDPs) and emphasizes transfer learning across different problems. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also involves optimization and decision making, which are relevant to cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
