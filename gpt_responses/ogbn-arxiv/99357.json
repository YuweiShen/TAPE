The paper also discusses the use of metrics to assess the convergence of these algorithms, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also touches on the control and optimization of these systems (cs.SY) and the use of robotics in multi-agent systems (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
