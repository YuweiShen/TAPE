It also involves the use of belief propagation and successive cancellation list decoder, which are common techniques in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also explores the relationship between different families of codes, which could be considered a topic in signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the use of numerical simulations suggests a focus on computer networks (cs.NI) or data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
