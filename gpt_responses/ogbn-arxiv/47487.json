This makes it likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Fisher vector aggregation, which are commonly used in Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Multimedia (cs.MM) fields. Finally, the paper proposes a more efficient and cost-effective approach to DCNN adaptation, which could also fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
