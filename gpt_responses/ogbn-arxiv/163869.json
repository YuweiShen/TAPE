Additionally, the paper discusses the use of cost functions and optimization techniques to generate interpretable explanations, which are common topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques for generating explanations.
