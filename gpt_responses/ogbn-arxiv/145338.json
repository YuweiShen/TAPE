The paper also discusses the design of network management applications, which could fall under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) or software engineering (cs.SE). The use of Web technologies also suggests a potential connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.DL) for automated network management. Finally, the paper discusses the security implications of collapsing network management platforms, which could fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
