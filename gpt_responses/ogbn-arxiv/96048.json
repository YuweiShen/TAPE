This makes cs.CR the most likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n2. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper covers the history and evolution of virtual machines and containers, which are key technologies in software engineering. It also discusses ongoing research into the future of secure isolation for multitenant infrastructures, which is relevant to software engineering.\n\n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the use of virtual machines and containers in cloud and container deployments, which are key areas of distributed computing.\n\n4. cs.OS (Operating Systems): The paper covers the history and evolution of virtual machines and containers, which are both technologies that have had a significant impact on operating systems.\n\n5. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the use of virtual machines and containers in software development, which is relevant to programming languages."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
