The paper also discusses the implementation of the abstraction in Concurrent Haskell, which falls under operating systems (cs.OS) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper provides a formal semantics and proves that the abstraction satisfies the opacity criterion, which is a topic in logic (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
