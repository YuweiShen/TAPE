The paper also proposes a variant of local differential privacy (LDP), which involves adding geometric noise to individual records, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the statistical utility of the proposed mechanism, which is related to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
