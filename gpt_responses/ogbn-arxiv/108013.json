This suggests that the paper could belong to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses a formalism based on bicategories to give a syntax for the interaction between public and private information, which could be seen as a logical framework for reasoning about information flow.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with encrypted communication and secret sharing protocols, which are central topics in information theory.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper provides a characterization of the security properties of encrypted communication and secret sharing protocols, which is a key concern in cryptography and security.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper formulates public-key cryptography using the proposed scheme, which involves the use of data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses nondeterministic classical procedures, which could be seen as a complexity-theoretic concept."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
