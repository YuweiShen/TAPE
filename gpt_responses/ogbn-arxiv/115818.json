The paper proposes a time-decaying dynamic interaction network (TDN) model to capture the dynamics of influence in reality and designs efficient streaming methods to identify influential nodes from highly dynamic node interaction streams. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). \n\nThe paper also deals with data management and algorithm design, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.SD (Databases), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the theoretical guarantees of the proposed algorithms, which is relevant to sub-category cs.THEORY (Theoretical Computer Science). \n\nOverall, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SI, cs.SD, cs.DS, cs.SOC, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
