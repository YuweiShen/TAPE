This involves optimizing the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) achieved through interference alignment, which is a key concept in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with wireless distributed computing, which involves communication and networking among mobile devices. The proposed approach aims to improve communication efficiency for data shuffling, which is a key aspect of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper discusses the deployment of machine learning mechanisms on intelligent mobile platforms such as smart vehicles and drones. The focus is on low-latency decisions with low risk of privacy breach, which are key concerns in machine learning. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with the design of transceivers for wireless distributed computing, which involves control and optimization of communication systems. The proposed approach aims to maximize the achieved degrees-of-freedom (DoF) through interference alignment, which is a key concept in control theory. \n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper deals with wireless distributed computing, which involves distributed computation and storage among mobile devices.
