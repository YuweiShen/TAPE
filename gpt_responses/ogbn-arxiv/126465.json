The focus on MIMO and digital-to-analog conversion also suggests a possible fit with cs.SY (systems and control) and cs.SP (signal processing). However, based on the content of the abstract and the likely audience for this paper, cs.IT, cs.NI, cs.SI, cs.LG, and cs.MM seem to be the most relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
