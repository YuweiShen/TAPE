The paper also proposes a novel framework that involves learning a conditional probability, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed framework uses a Siamese network, which is a type of neural network, and involves optimization, which are both topics in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on two datasets, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
