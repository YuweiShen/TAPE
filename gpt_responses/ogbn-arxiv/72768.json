Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes an alternating gradient descent scheme, which involves optimization techniques commonly used in machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, the paper deals with image datasets, which is a topic in computer graphics (GR) and multimedia (MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
