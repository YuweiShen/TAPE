The use of extreme value theory (EVT) and the analysis of moments suggest a mathematical analysis (cs.MA) component to the paper. The paper also discusses the outage probability and rate, which are performance metrics in wireless communication systems, and thus, the paper could be related to systems and control (cs.SI). Finally, the use of stochastic ordering suggests a game theory (cs.GT) component to the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
