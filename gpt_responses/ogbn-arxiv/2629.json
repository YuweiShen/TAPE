The paper also discusses the limitations of current artificial data augmentation techniques and proposes the use of videos as a natural source of augmentation, which relates to the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on a variety of tasks, including object recognition and semantic segmentation, which are common topics in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
