The strategies discussed in the paper involve imputation, reduction, and marginalization, which are techniques used in data science and statistics. The experimental studies involve algorithms such as Isolation Forest, LODA, and EGMM, which are commonly used in computer vision and cybersecurity, falling under the categories of computer vision (cs.CV) and cryptography and security (cs.CR). Overall, the paper covers a broad range of topics in computer science, but the focus on machine learning and data analysis suggests that the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
