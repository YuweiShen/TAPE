This falls under the domain of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a mobility model for vehicular networks and discusses the communication between mobile users and base stations. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with millimeter-wave communications, which is a key technology for multimedia applications such as high-definition video streaming. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an optimal design for beam sweeping and communication in mobile millimeter-wave networks, which involves control and optimization of system parameters. \n5. cs.PF (Performance): The paper evaluates the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of average rate and transmission power, and compares it with the IEEE 802.11ad standard. This falls under the domain of performance evaluation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
