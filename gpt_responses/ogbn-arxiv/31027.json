The proposed method also involves the use of Gaussian functions and sampling techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.MM) and statistical learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel stabilization loss to address time delay and non-smooth issues, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the precise estimation of facial landmarks, which can be considered as a graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
