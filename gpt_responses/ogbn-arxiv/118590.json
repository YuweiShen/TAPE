The use of superposition coding and rate-splitting suggests a focus on network information theory (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of lattice codes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CE). Finally, the paper mentions the use of Gaussian codes, which could be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
