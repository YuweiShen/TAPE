It also mentions the use of public key cryptography and a \"Web of Trust\" for identity verification, which are cryptographic concepts. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a decentralized solution for creating and owning global identities, which is a distributed computing problem. It also mentions the use of distributed ledger/blockchain technology for natural realization of the solution. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the social impact of not having a trustworthy global identity system and the need for a grassroots solution that empowers individuals. It also mentions the need for an egalitarian cryptocurrency to fuel the mechanism, which has societal implications. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the formation of a \"Web of Trust\" among global identities, which is a network concept. It also mentions the need for a mechanism that encourages honest behavior, which is a social network problem. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper mentions the need to store public keys, but not personal information, which is a database concern. However, this is a less likely category compared to the others."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
