Therefore, cs.NI (Networks and Internet Architecture) is the most likely category. The paper also discusses safety and efficiency applications, which are related to security and privacy (cs.CR) and control systems (cs.SY). The proposed algorithm involves adapting to specific propagation environments and application requirements, which involves information theory (cs.IT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
