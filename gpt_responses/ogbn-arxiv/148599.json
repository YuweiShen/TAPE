This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) category. The paper also discusses space-time trade-offs and efficient construction, which are topics that are often studied in the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.IT (Information Theory) categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a deterministic solution, which is a topic that is relevant to the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) category. Finally, the paper uses techniques such as hashing and sampling, which are often studied in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
