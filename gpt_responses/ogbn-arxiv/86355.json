The paper proposes a new architecture for object detection that incorporates top-down modulations, which involves selecting and integrating contextual information and low-level features. This suggests that the paper could also be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG), as these fields are closely related to computer vision. Additionally, the paper proposes a new network architecture, which could also fall under neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
