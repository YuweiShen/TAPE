The paper proposes a new dataset schema for learning coordinated behavior in MASs, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.AI) and learning from demonstration (cs.LG). The coordination of agents in MASs is a key issue, which falls under the subfield of Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA). Finally, the paper discusses the validation of the proposed solution in a Multi-Robot System, which falls under the subfield of Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
