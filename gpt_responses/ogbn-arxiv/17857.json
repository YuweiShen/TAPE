This makes it likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The paper also discusses planning in a smaller latent state space, which suggests it could be relevant to Robotics (cs.RO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions new strategies for exploration and transfer learning, which could place it in the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
