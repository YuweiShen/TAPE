The authors propose a new approach to address the problem of discontinuous boundaries in existing regression-based rotation detectors, which involves designing a new rotation detection baseline and a circular smooth label technique. This involves classification tasks and error tolerance, which are key topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with the problem of periodicity in angle prediction, which is a key topic in robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper applies the proposed approach to scene text datasets, which is a key topic in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
