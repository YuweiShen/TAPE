It uses stochastic geometry to derive tractable expressions for the coverage probability and capacity of the network. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). Other likely sub-categories include cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.MA (Multiagent Systems), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
