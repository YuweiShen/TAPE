This method is based on style transfer and spoof image representation models, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. The paper also addresses the challenge of obtaining fraudulent images from all users to train the models, which is a common issue in cybersecurity (cs.CR) research.
