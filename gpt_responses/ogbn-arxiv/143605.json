The approach presented in the paper involves training CNN models with binary input data, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper evaluates the approach on three datasets, which involves data analysis and processing, making it relevant to data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
