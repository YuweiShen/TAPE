The paper also mentions the use of rehearsal to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which is a common issue in neural networks used for computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper discusses the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, which could fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
