This makes it likely to belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) category. Additionally, the paper discusses applications, libraries, prover enhancements, interfaces, and experience reports, which are all related to software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL). The use of automated reasoning also has applications in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper may also relate to formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL) due to its focus on theorem proving."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
