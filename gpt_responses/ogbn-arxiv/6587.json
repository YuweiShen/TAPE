The focus on work motivation and the impact on team dynamics suggests a human-computer interaction (cs.HC) aspect. The study also touches on the cultural and organizational aspects of the interface between the agile team and the non-agile organization, which could be categorized under cybernetics (cs.CY) and social and information networks (cs.SI).
