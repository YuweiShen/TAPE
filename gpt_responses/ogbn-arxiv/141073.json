This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and logic (cs.LO). The paper also mentions logic programming semantics, which is a subfield of programming languages (cs.PL). Additionally, the paper discusses the elimination of operators, which is a topic in computational logic (cs.CL) and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
