This is a security concern in blockchain technology. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the use of software transactional memory systems (OSTMs and MV-OSTMs) to execute smart contracts concurrently, which is a programming language concept. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper mentions the use of a block graph (BG) to capture conflicting relations among transactions, which is a data structure used in the validation process. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a framework for executing smart contracts concurrently using object semantics, which is a software engineering concept."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
