The proposed method involves a non-linear mixed-effects statistical model, which is a common approach in statistical inference (cs.ST) and computational neuroscience (cs.NE). The method also uses a deformation model and a numerical scheme to compute parallel transport on a manifold, which are common techniques in computational geometry (cs.CG) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
