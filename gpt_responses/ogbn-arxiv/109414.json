Specifically, it proposes a probabilistic model for joint semantic synthesis and morphological analysis of derived words. This falls under the broad category of computational linguistics (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of neural networks for vector composition suggests a possible connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the study of morphological productivity could be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
