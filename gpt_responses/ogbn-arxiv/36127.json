This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the use of Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (ROBDDs) to provide security, which is a topic in computer science theory (cs.DS). The paper also involves the study of provably secure logic locking mechanisms, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE). The use of canonical representations of boolean functionality is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and the paper also involves the analysis of the overhead incurred by the proposed defense mechanism, which falls under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
