This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) categories, as it involves image processing and analysis for movement monitoring. The use of neural networks also suggests that it may fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Additionally, the focus on improving patient care and supporting clinicians in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) suggests that it may also fall under the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
