Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of a light-weight model and mixed precision training, which are related to machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Hence, cs.LG is also a likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the impact on power consumption, which is related to multimedia (MM) systems. Therefore, cs.MM is another possible sub-category. The paper involves training and inference on the edge nodes, which is related to artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (CR). Hence, cs.AI and cs.CR are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
