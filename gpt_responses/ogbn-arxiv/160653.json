The proposed approach involves the use of graphical models and high-order potentials, which are also common in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of video sequences, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
