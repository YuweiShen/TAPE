The paper also mentions the use of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) for efficient propagation, as well as the use of formal methods (cs.PL) for proving correctness. The paper also discusses the design and implementation of software (cs.SE) for deriving correct propagators. Finally, the paper mentions logic (cs.LO) in the context of the Curry-Howard isomorphism."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
