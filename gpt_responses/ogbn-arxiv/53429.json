The paper also involves the use of subjective ratings by human observers, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). The proposed metric is based on local weights, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques (cs.AI) and statistical analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
