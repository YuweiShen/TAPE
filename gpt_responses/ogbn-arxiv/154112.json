Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of semantic relatedness and vector-based similarity, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning and data mining, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a likely sub-category as well. The paper also deals with legal documents and regulatory policies, which could fall under the sub-categories of cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
