Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel deep learning framework for multi-task learning, which involves transfer learning and unsupervised learning techniques. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper applies its proposed method to a publicly available neuroimaging cohort, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
