The paper also discusses the decoding time complexity of the codes, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of expander codes and their properties suggest that the paper may also fall under the category of distributed systems (cs.DS) or social networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the capacity of binary symmetric channels, which is a topic in network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
