Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves machine learning techniques to develop models for video quality inference, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of end-to-end encryption, which is a topic related to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also mentions the use of lightweight features, which could be related to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
