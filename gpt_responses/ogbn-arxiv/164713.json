This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also mentions SLAM and visual odometry, which are related to computer vision (cs.CV). The use of Lie groups in estimation algorithms also involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the manipulation of jacobian matrices, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY) and mechanical engineering (cs.ME)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
