The use of a communication graph suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT). The paper proposes a novel approach to decentralized estimation that involves a combination of common and local estimates, which may be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
