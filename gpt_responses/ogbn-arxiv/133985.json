Specifically, it investigates cross-lingual annotation projection methods and proposes a method to include external information in the RNN to train higher level taggers. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. The paper also uses RNN models, which are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper's focus on neural networks and their training could also place it in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper's use of bidirectional RNN models and its investigation of cross-lingual annotation projection methods could also suggest a connection to cs.DL (Deep Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
