This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed approach is tested on a box-pushing task, which involves robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses the effect of different auxiliary losses on learning transition models, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
