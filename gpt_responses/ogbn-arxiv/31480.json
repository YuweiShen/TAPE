It presents models and inference procedures that balance the context-sensitive costs of deferring alerts with the cost of interruption. The paper also discusses the challenge of reasoning about such costs under uncertainty via an analysis of user activity and the content of notifications. These topics are all related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the problem of guiding alerts about email messages, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses the Priorities system, which is related to cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
