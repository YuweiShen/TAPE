This approach is implemented in PUMICE, an end-user programmable agent. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HCI) category. Additionally, the paper involves machine learning techniques to enable the agent to learn new concepts and conditionals from natural language and demonstrations, which makes it relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. The paper also involves natural language processing techniques to understand and interpret natural language instructions, which makes it relevant to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) category. Finally, the paper involves information retrieval techniques to enable the agent to refer to contents within GUIs of existing mobile apps, which makes it relevant to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
