The task of scraping on a tilt board is also a robotics task. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper utilizes a data-driven approach for learning the feedback model from demonstrations. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with developing a reactive policy for a robot to adapt to changes in its environment, which falls under the domain of AI. \n4. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although the paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, the task of scraping on a tilt board involves tactile sensor traces, which can be considered as a form of sensory input. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with developing a feedback model for a robot to adapt its motion plan, which falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
