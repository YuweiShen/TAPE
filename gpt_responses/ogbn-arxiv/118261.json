The paper also proposes the use of a high-frequency inductive voltage regulator (IVR) to increase resistance against EMSCA, which involves hardware design and implementation (cs.AR). The IVR is used to improve energy-efficiency, which falls under the category of electronic engineering (cs.ET). The paper also discusses the practical side-channel analysis techniques used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper involves the measurement and analysis of electromagnetic emissions, which falls under the category of electromagnetics (cs.EM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
