Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of state-of-the-art SSL algorithms such as $\\Pi$-model, temporal ensembling, mean teacher, etc., which are related to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG and cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of dropout, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
