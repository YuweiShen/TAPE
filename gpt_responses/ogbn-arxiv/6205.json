The problem involves encoding sparse sequences, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses connections to communication complexity, which is a topic in theoretical computer science (cs.CC). The use of local decodability constraints suggests a focus on error-correcting codes, which is a topic in signal processing and machine learning (cs.SI).
