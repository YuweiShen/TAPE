The use of human experts and their opinions also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The models proposed for fusing expert opinions involve probabilistic reasoning, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the evaluation and training of image classification models, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the use of tiles in image classification suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
