This involves the use of different waveforms, such as OFDM/OQAM and CP-OFDM, and the analysis of cross-interference between them. This topic falls under several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Communications (cs.COMM), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
