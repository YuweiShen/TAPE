These tasks are typically associated with sub-categories such as artificial intelligence (cs.AI), databases (cs.DB), and cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper also proposes a system that uses rule-based annotators to augment training data for neural models, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI, cs.DB, and cs.CR, followed by cs.LG and cs.IR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
