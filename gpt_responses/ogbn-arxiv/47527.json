It may also belong to the sub-category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) as it addresses the issue of insecure channels and attacks on IoT devices. Additionally, it could be categorized under Systems and Control (cs.SY) as it deals with the management of credentials and the implementation of a new layer in the networking architecture. Software Engineering (cs.SE) and Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) are also possible sub-categories as the paper discusses the modular abstraction layer and swapping of underlying implementations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
