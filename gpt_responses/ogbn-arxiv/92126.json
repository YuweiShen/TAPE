The problem of finding spanners with small stretch factor and few edges is also related to graph theory (cs.DM) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper presents lower bounds on the number of edges required for spanners, which is a topic in graph theory (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
