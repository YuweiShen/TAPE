The use of linear programming models to assess and optimize these protocols also involves mathematical optimization and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the need for energy-efficient and delay reduction techniques, which relates to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The simulations conducted using NS-2 involve system and control theory (cs.SY), and the use of MATLAB for analytical simulations involves machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
