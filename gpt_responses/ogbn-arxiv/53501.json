The paper also considers the impact of imperfect channel state information (CSI) on the system performance, which is a key topic in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the design of a wireless communication system, which is a key topic in networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not explicitly deal with social networks, but the design of wireless communication systems is relevant to the study of social and information networks. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not explicitly deal with machine learning, but the design of beamformers involves optimization problems that may be solved using machine learning techniques. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper does not explicitly deal with multimedia, but the design of wireless communication systems is relevant to the transmission of multimedia content."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
