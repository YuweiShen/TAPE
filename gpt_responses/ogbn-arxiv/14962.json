The paper also discusses the communication cost of data parallelism, which is a concern in distributed computing (cs.DC). The use of deep neural networks suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) may also be relevant sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a new framework for selecting which parameters to communicate, which could be considered a form of optimization (cs.AI, cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
