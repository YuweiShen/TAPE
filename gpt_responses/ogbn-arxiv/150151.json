This topic falls under the category of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper discusses the diversity found in current wearable devices, which suggests a focus on Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). The paper also discusses the efficiency and energy costs of VLC compared to radio-frequency (RF) devices, which suggests a focus on Information Theory (cs.IT) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper mentions the drastic changes in light conditions due to mobility, which suggests a focus on Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
