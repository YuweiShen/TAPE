The use of Approximate Message Passing (AMP) method is a common technique in information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SP) communities. The paper also discusses the use of factor graphical modeling, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SP). The paper also discusses the comparison of the proposed method with a conventional first-order method, which is a common topic in optimization (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SP) communities. Finally, the paper discusses the application of the proposed method for 2D sparsity separation, which is a common topic in image processing (cs.SI) and signal processing (cs.SP) communities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
