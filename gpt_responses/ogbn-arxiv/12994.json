The main focus of the paper is on constructing and querying a common artifact used for process mining, which involves handling and processing large amounts of data, suggesting that the paper could also belong to the categories of databases (cs.DB), distributed computing (cs.DC), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a practical implementation of the approach using an existing platform, which could also place it in the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
