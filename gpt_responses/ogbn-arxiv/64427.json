The use of image captions also involves natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper proposes a multi-modal network that learns joint embeddings, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of compound concepts also involves multimodal learning (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves information retrieval as it harvests information from captions (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
