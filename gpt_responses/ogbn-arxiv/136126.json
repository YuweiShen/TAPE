The model is evaluated on several benchmark question answering datasets, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) sub-category of Computer Science (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper introduces a new sparse block structure to the attention matrix, which could be of interest to researchers in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also evaluates the model's performance on document understanding tasks, which could be relevant to researchers in the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
