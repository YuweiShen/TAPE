The paper also focuses on the effectiveness of the evolved ANNs in classification problems, which is a common application of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of ANNs in image classification, which falls under the category of Computer Vision (cs.CV). The methodology presented in the paper can also be applied to control systems, which falls under the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of current grammar-based NeuroEvolution approaches, which falls under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
