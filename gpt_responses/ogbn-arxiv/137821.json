The proposed method involves a back-projection based reconstruction algorithm, which is related to the sub-category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also mentions physically significant and repeatable parameters, which suggests a connection to the sub-category of control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the use of compressed data and the reconstruction of spatial fields suggest a connection to the sub-categories of multimedia (cs.MM) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
