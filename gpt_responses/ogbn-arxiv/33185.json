This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) as well as electronic and computer engineering (cs.ET). The proposed framework for the definition of the message update faulty functions involves the analysis of the convergence behavior of finite alphabet iterative decoders (FAIDs), which is related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and computer architecture (cs.AR). The paper also discusses the existence of robust and nonrobust FAIDs, which is related to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
