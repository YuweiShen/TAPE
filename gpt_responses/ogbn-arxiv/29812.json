The paper also discusses the time complexity of the operations, which is related to algorithms (cs.AL) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the practical evaluation of the proposed data structure involves experiments and simulations, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
