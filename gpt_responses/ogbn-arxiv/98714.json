This involves developing a universal solver for solving general EMMs and calculating the influence functions of the EMM to quantify robustness to outliers. The paper also demonstrates the enhanced robustness and flexibility of the proposed framework over the standard Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) through comprehensive simulations. Given these aspects, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.ST (Statistics), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
