The focus on inducing sparse constraints at each layer of the DBN suggests that the paper may also fall under \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE). The use of DBN for hand-written digit recognition suggests that the paper may also fall under \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\" (cs.CV) and \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). Finally, the exploration of classification accuracy in different datasets suggests that the paper may also fall under \"Computation and Language\" (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
