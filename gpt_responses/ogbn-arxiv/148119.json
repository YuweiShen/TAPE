This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also considers the impact of antenna noise on the performance of the receiver, which is related to system engineering (cs.SY) and networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the detection error probability and achievable data rate, which are relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
