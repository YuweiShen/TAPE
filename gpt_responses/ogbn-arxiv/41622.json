The paper also discusses the use of state-of-the-art machine learning models (cs.LG) and the modification of GAN architectures (cs.AI) for the task. Additionally, the paper involves the evaluation of the generated images based on visual criteria (cs.GR) and the use of synthesized images for skin lesion classification (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
