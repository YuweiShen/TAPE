The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) also suggests machine learning (cs.MM) as a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the photo response non-uniformity (PRNU) noise pattern, which is a common technique in image forensics and falls under cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of noiseprint, a CNN-based camera model fingerprint, also suggests information retrieval (cs.IR) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the training of the CNN to minimize distance between same-model patches and maximize distance otherwise suggests a focus on optimization and learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
