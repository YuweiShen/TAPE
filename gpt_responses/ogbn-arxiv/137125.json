The paper also discusses the use of definitions and free equality to reason intentionally about syntax, which is a topic relevant to software engineering (cs.SE) and logical frameworks (cs.LF). Finally, the paper presents a cut-elimination procedure, which is a fundamental concept in proof theory (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
