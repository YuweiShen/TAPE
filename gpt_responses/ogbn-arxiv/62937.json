The use of semantic features and Gaussian Process also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the evaluation of the approach on real-world data collected from a vehicle suggests a potential application in systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
