The algorithms presented in the paper involve data structures and combinatorial techniques, which are also relevant to the sub-categories of cs.DS (data structures and algorithms) and cs.DM (discrete mathematics). The paper also discusses the complexity of drawing graphs, which is a topic in graph theory (cs.GR). Finally, the paper presents an algorithm for drawing maximal planar graphs with circular arcs, which is a topic in computational geometry and visualization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
