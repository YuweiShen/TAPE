However, the paper also introduces a diagrammatic language and uses category theory to derive a sound and complete axiomatisation of query inclusion, which could place it in sub-categories such as cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.CS (Computer Science and Game Theory), or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
