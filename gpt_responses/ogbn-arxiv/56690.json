This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses fine-tuning the VGG architecture, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for improving the performance of pre-trained models. The experiments carried out in the paper involve adjusting model parameters to improve accuracy, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The ultimate goal of this work is to improve the capabilities of domestic robots, which falls under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with image datasets, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
