The paper also uses qualitative and quantitative research methods to analyze user perception and propose an information-theoretical method, which falls under human-computer interaction (cs.HCI) and social computing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper deals with natural language processing (cs.CL) as it involves analyzing tags produced by users. Finally, the paper's evaluation on real data involves machine learning (cs.DL) techniques to assess the accuracy of the proposed method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
