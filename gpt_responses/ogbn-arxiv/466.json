It could also belong to cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) as it deals with the power grid and routing impact. Additionally, it involves feature extraction and model selection, which are common topics in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper deals with EM/IR hotspots, which could be related to cs.EM (Electromagnetics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
