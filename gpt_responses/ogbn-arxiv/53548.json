The use of stochastic network calculus and queuing theory suggests that the paper may also belong to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The focus on industrial applications and process automation suggests that the paper may also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. The consideration of channel heterogeneity and the use of simulation studies suggest that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-categories, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
