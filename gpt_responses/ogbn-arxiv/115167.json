The method involves minimizing an energy functional using ADMM, which is a numerical optimization technique (cs.NA). The algorithm involves solving an elliptic problem and a point-wise minimization problem, which are common in computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the experiments involve testing the proposed algorithm on n-dimensional data, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
