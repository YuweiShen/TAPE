However, the paper also discusses machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and control systems (cs.SY) in the context of DNN inference. Additionally, the paper proposes a shared multi-tenant system for DNN inference, which involves resource allocation and scheduling, which is related to the field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
