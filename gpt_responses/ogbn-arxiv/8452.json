The use of deep neural networks to extract a high-level latent motion representation suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the potential applications of the method in performance cloning, video-driven cartoons, and motion retrieval suggest a connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
