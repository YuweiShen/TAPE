This topic falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also considers the effect of narrowband interference (cs.NI) and assumes knowledge of the channel correlation matrix (cs.SY). Finally, the paper uses Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) (cs.MM) as the modulation scheme."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
