The proposed method, Neural Calibration, is a post-hoc calibration method that can be applied to any machine learning model, making it relevant to a wide range of applications in these subfields. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.IR, and cs.CL, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
