This involves the use of convolutional neural networks (cs.CV) to automatically learn features from raw perception and adapt non-linear reward-bonus function parameters. The paper also mentions the use of policy-gradient methods (cs.AI) and variance-reducing gradient methods (cs.NE) to improve the performance of the algorithm. Finally, the paper discusses the application of the method to sequential decision-making problems (cs.GT) and the use of machine learning techniques to improve performance (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
