Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as it deals with extracting parallel data for training the NMT model. The use of word embeddings also suggests that the paper could belong to cs.LG (Learning) or cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the use of NMT suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.DL (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
