The paper also discusses the abstraction level of image cues and how it affects feature selection, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper uses deep neural networks, which is a subfield of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the symbolic code in images, which is relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
