The focus is on the mechanical and control aspects of the system, which are central to the field of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the use of viscoelastic materials and the design of a disturbance observer, which are relevant to the fields of materials science (cs.ME) and control systems (cs.SY). The experiments conducted on the leg testbed involve lifting payloads and studying the response to external forces, which are relevant to the fields of electromechanical systems (cs.EM) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
