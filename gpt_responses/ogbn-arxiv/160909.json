The use of Bayesian optimization and artificial intelligence techniques also suggests a connection to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also discusses the scalability of the proposed approach, which suggests a connection to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The use of probabilistic completeness and Bayesian optimization also suggests a connection to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category.
