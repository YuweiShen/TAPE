The paper also investigates the consistency of website blocklists across ISPs, which could be considered a topic in computer networks (cs.NI) or distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The use of SNI inspection for blocking websites is a topic in computer systems and hardware (cs.AR) and cybersecurity (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the compilation of a list of potentially blocked websites, which could be considered a topic in cybercrime (cs.CR) or social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper proposes a suite of tests for detecting censorship, which could be considered a topic in cybersecurity (cs.CR) or computer systems and hardware (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
