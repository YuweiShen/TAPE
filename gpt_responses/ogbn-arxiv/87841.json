This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of the option-critic architecture and proximal policy optimization suggests a focus on robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the results on Mujoco domains suggest a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
