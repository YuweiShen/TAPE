The use of linear programming and concentration inequalities suggests that the paper is likely to be in the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. Additionally, the use of standard Gaussian vectors and sparse support suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) categories. Finally, the use of slack variables and penalty terms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
