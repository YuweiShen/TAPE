The system model includes an advanced battery model and forecasting errors for demand and generation. This suggests a focus on control and optimization of energy systems, which falls under the scope of cs.SY.\n- cs.GT (Game Theory): The paper formulates the scheduling problem as a discrete time dynamic game, where each player (prosumer) aims to maximize their utility function subject to constraints. The authors derive a closed-form solution for the best-response problem of a player and construct an iterative algorithm to solve the game. This indicates a significant contribution to the field of game theory, which is why cs.GT is a likely sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions the use of forecasting errors for demand and generation, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques for prediction. However, the focus of the paper is on the game-theoretic approach to scheduling energy storage, rather than the machine learning aspect. Therefore, cs.LG is a less likely sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Similar to cs.LG, the paper mentions the use of forecasting errors for demand and generation, which suggests the use of AI techniques for prediction.
