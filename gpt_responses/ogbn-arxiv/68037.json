Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is Computer Vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of hyper-parameters to trade off between latency and accuracy, which falls under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also introduces a streamlined architecture that uses depth-wise separable convolutions, which is related to the field of Neural Networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of MobileNets across a wide range of applications, including large scale geo-localization, which falls under the category of Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
