The proposed method involves combining deep features with classic machine learning techniques, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve multiple datasets, which could also be classified under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of collaborative weights to combine representations suggests a potential application in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
