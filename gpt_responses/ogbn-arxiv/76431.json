The use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) is also mentioned in the abstract as a key component of self-driving technology. The paper also discusses the safety-critical nature of the tasks involved, which suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY). Machine learning (cs.LG) is also a possible sub-category given the potential use of data-driven approaches for motion planning and control. Finally, computer vision (cs.CV) may also be relevant for perception and understanding of the environment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
