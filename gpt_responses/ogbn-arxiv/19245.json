The paper proposes a hardware accelerator for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that is optimized for energy-constrained mobile applications. The paper discusses the challenges of deploying CNNs on FPGA due to limited on-chip memory and computation resources, which falls under the category of hardware architecture (cs.AR). The proposed architecture is specifically designed for CNNs used in computer vision applications, which falls under the category of computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of FPGA for embedded systems, which falls under the category of embedded systems (cs.ET). The proposed architecture is designed to maximize throughput and reduce external memory access, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach for exploiting intra-layer parallelism in CNNs, which falls under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
