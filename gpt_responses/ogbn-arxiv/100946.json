Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also uses statistical tests and analyzes various notions of regret, which suggests that it could also be relevant to cs.ST (Statistics) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
