This involves analyzing cardiac MR sequences to identify regional wall motions and classify them into four types. The paper uses non-local neural networks for segment- and subject-level modeling, which is a popular technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The method also involves temporal interpolation of convolution kernels, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed method using correlation and accuracy metrics, which are commonly used in neural network evaluation (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
