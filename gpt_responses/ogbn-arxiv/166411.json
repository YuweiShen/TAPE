This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper investigates different precoding techniques for multi-user MIMO systems, which is a key technology in wireless networking. The proposed technique aims to improve the security of wireless networks, which is also a relevant topic in networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper focuses on physical-layer security, which is a subfield of cryptography and security. The proposed technique involves injecting artificial noise to improve the secrecy rate, which is a common technique in physical-layer security.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the performance of different precoding techniques in terms of bit error rate (BER), which is a key metric in multimedia applications such as video streaming and audio transmission.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a successive optimization technique for non-linear precoding, which involves optimizing the transmission strategy based on the channel state information. This falls under the scope of systems and control, which deals with the design and analysis of complex systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
