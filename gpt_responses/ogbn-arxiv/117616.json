The paper proposes a novel approach for compressing gradient communication in distributed machine learning, which is a common problem in this field. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
