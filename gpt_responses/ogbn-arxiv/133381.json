Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves the use of a novel CNN architecture for implicit learning of depth maps and heatmap distributions, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with robotics applications, which falls under the sub-category of cs.RO (Robotics). Finally, the paper involves the estimation of 3D pose, which can be considered as a geometric problem, falling under the sub-category of cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
