It also uses relational reasoning modules, which are a type of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) technique. The paper proposes a novel framework for applying the non-local module, which involves optimizing the use of computational resources, a topic that falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the incorporation of relative spatial information, which is a common topic in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
