The proposed method uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) model, which is a type of deep learning algorithm, to identify the channel condition based on the channel state information (CSI) obtained from WLAN devices. Therefore, it is likely to be classified under Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
