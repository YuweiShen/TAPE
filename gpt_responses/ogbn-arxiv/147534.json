Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new method for training these denoisers without ground truth data, which involves using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE). This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper involves statistical estimation and optimization, which could make it relevant to cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
