The proposed method involves developing a novel loss function and learning algorithm, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the method on several standard datasets, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
