The use of expanders and minimum degree $\\Theta(n)$ suggests a focus on network topology and connectivity, which falls under cs.NE (Networks and Internet Architecture) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The use of randomness and pseudorandom objects suggests a focus on randomized algorithms, which falls under cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the use of a novel reduction between rumor spreading processes and branching programs suggests a focus on distributed computing and parallel algorithms, which falls under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
