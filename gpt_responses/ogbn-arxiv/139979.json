The method involves using sampling-based algorithms and graph search to incrementally generate a roadmap for efficient inspection planning. This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions applications in medical robotics, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the method involves optimizing the inspection plan, which could involve machine learning techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
