This involves image recognition and classification, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of neural networks also falls under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of a parabolic activation function, which falls under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category.
