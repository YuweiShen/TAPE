The reduction technique used in the paper involves modifying the inner verifier of the Khot-Saket outer PCP verifier, which is a technique commonly used in the study of probabilistically checkable proofs and hardness of approximation (cs.DS). The paper also makes use of hypergraph coloring hardness reductions, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper involves the analysis of the complexity of the hypergraph coloring problem, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
