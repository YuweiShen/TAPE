The use of proof nets and matrices also suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), where these tools have been applied to automated theorem proving. The paper also involves comparisons of different proof schemes, which could be relevant to the area of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
