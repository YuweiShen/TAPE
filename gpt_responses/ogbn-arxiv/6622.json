The use of linear codes and linear dispersion space-time codes suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Network Information Theory (cs.NI) sub-category. The application of integer-forcing equalization and single-stream decoding is related to the Communication (cs.COMM) sub-category. Finally, the use of multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver is a key feature of MIMO systems, making the paper relevant to the Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
