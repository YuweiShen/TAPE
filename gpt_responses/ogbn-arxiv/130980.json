This fits tightly with syntactic, semantic, and proof theoretic fundamentals of formal logic, which suggests that the paper may belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. The paper also mentions the Curry-Howard correspondence and its potential for characterizing computational complexity classes, which suggests that it may also belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Logic and Verification (cs.LF) sub-categories. The paper's focus on types as semantical properties and its potential applications in implicit computational complexity and extraction of programs from proofs suggest that it may also belong to the Theory of Computation (cs.TC) and Computation and Language (cs.CL) sub-categories. However, since the paper's main contribution is the extension of intrinsic theories to data given by any combination of inductive and coinductive definitions, the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category may be the most relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
