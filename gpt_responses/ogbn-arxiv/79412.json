The analysis of type-\\RNum{1} and \\RNum{2} error exponents involves statistical learning and inference (cs.LG). The study of sensitivity of the test for small relative entropy balls involves control theory and dynamical systems (cs.SY). The paper also involves the analysis of worst-case error exponents, which is related to the field of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of mismatched likelihood ratio testing, which is a problem in machine learning and pattern recognition (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
