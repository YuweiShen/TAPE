This involves network architecture and design, which falls under the purview of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper proposes a novel approach to cooperative sensing using techniques from cooperative game theory. This falls under the purview of computer science and game theory. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with the formation of overlapping coalitions among secondary users for cooperative sensing.
