The approach involves learning from Hindsight Inverse Dynamics based on Hindsight Experience Replay, which is a technique used to enable the learning process in a self-imitated manner. This approach can be trained with supervised learning and can work in isolation or be combined with other on-policy and off-policy algorithms. Given the focus on reinforcement learning and machine learning techniques, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
