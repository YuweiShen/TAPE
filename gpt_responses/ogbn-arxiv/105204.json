The paper also proposes an unsupervised domain adaptation framework, which involves updating the parameters of the detector, generating pseudo annotations, and minimizing the cross entropy loss, which are all related to machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The use of multimodal information (visible and thermal) also suggests that the paper could be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the application of the proposed method to autonomous driving and video surveillance suggests that it could also be relevant to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
