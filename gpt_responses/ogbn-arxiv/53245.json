The paper also considers the effects of mismatched detection and decoding, which falls under the category of system theory (cs.SY). The use of multiple antennas and modulation schemes suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with the impact of noise on the transmitter side, which is a topic related to networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
