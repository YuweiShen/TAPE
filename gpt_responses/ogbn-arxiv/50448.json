The paper proposes a new method based on the LinUCB algorithm for contextual-bandit problems. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with information retrieval (IR) and human-computer interaction (HC) since it aims to improve the recommendation system's performance for new users. Additionally, the paper involves artificial intelligence (AI) and computational engineering (CE) since it proposes a new method for solving the cold-start problem in recommendation systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
