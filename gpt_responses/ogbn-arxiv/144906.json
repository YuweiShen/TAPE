This involves designing lookup tables to replace conventional operations in message passing decoding. The paper is likely to be categorized under Information Theory (cs.IT) as it deals with error correction codes, and also under Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) as it involves communication systems. It may also be categorized under Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) as it involves network coding, Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) as it involves lookup table design, and Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it involves the use of the information bottleneck method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
