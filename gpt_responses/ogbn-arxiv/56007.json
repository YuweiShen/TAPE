This technique is theoretically underpinned by the optimization of the coherence between the sparsity and sensing bases. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): Compressed sensing is a topic of information theory, which deals with efficient data representation and transmission. The paper proposes a novel compressed sensing technique for MRI acceleration, which involves premodulating the signal of interest and reconstructing it with nonlinear algorithms that promote sparsity. Therefore, cs.IT is the most likely sub-category for this paper. \n\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): MRI is a medical imaging modality that produces images of the human body. Therefore, the paper may also belong to the computer vision and pattern recognition sub-category, which deals with image analysis and processing. The paper presents numerical simulations, phantom, and in vivo experiments on a 7T scanner to evaluate the proposed technique. Therefore, cs.CV is a likely sub-category for this paper. \n\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): MRI is a multimedia data type that combines images and signals. Therefore, the paper may also belong to the multimedia sub-category, which deals with the representation, processing, and analysis of multimedia data. The"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
