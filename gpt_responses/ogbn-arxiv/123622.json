The proposed method involves designing a new loss function and anchor string mechanism, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions experiments on scene text detection datasets, which falls under the category of natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
