The use of inter-document similarities to improve the fusion process suggests that the paper may be relevant to the subfield of IR that deals with semantic similarity and relatedness (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper may be relevant to the subfield of natural language processing (NLP) that deals with text similarity and relatedness (cs.CL), as well as to the subfield of deep learning (DL) that deals with representation learning and similarity metrics (cs.DL). The use of graph-based methods to model relevance-status propagation suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of machine learning (LG) that deals with graph-based models and algorithms. Finally, the use of retrieval scores and ranks suggests that the paper may be relevant to the subfield of databases (DB) that deals with ranking and relevance in information retrieval systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
