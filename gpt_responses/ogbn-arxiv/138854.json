The paper also focuses on designing a lightweight and efficient model, which suggests that the authors may have used techniques from machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to achieve this goal. Additionally, the paper incorporates kinematic structure and geometric priors, which are concepts commonly used in robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
