The paper also considers the nonlinear characteristics of a light emitting diode (LED) and proposes a pre-distorter for compensation, which falls under the category of networked and distributed systems (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a power allocation strategy and derives analytical upper bounds for the bit error rate, which are topics related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
