The proposed method is fully self-supervised, which falls under the category of machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI). The paper also introduces a novel reconstruction loss that is edge-preserving, which is related to graphics (GR). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.RO, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.GR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
