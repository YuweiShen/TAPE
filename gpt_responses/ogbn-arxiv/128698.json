Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new lock-free tree data structure for parallel MCTS, which involves data structures and algorithms, falling under cs.DS and cs.PL. The paper also discusses the pipeline pattern, which is a programming paradigm, and hence, cs.PL and cs.SE are likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with parallel computing, which falls under cs.DC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
