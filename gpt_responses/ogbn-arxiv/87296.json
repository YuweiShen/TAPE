The paper specifically focuses on adaptive behavior policy sharing, which is a technique for sharing experience collected by behavior policies that are adaptively selected from a pool of agents trained with an ensemble of hyper-parameters. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers a broad range of topics related to machine learning, including deep learning, reinforcement learning, and optimization. Given that the paper is about training deep reinforcement learning models, it is highly likely to belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers research related to artificial intelligence, including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. Given that the paper is about training deep reinforcement learning models, it is also likely to belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): This sub-category covers research related to robotics, including control, perception, and planning. Reinforcement learning is a popular technique for training robots, so it is possible that the paper could belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category covers research related to systems and control, including control theory, optimization, and robotics. Given that the paper is about training deep reinforcement learning"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
