This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also considers the potential erroneous decision of SIC, which is related to signal processing and error correction (cs.SI). The use of multiple antennas in the system is a characteristic of networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper involves mathematical analysis and optimization, which is related to theoretical computer science (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
