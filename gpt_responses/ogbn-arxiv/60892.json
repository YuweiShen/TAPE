It could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as summarization is closely related to the task of retrieving relevant information from a large corpus. Additionally, the paper proposes a theoretical model that could be used to improve summarization systems, which falls under the scope of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper also includes experiments to demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework, which could be considered as falling under the scope of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
