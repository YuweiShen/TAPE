The proposed methodology involves fusing visual and inertial measurements, which are common in computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics. The use of optimization-based estimation methods is also common in machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper leverages the IMU preintegration method, which is a technique commonly used in robotics and computer vision (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
