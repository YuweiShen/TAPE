The approach uses probabilistic sampling and a sparse roadmap spanner (SPARS) to store and retrieve past experiences efficiently. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the approach uses machine learning techniques to improve planning efficiency, which suggests that it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of whole body humanoid motion planning, which suggests that it could belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The approach is demonstrated on a 30 degrees of freedom humanoid robot, which suggests that it could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of graph-based storage of experiences, which suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
