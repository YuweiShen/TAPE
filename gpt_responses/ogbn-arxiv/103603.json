This involves training neural networks to estimate the probability distribution of the 35 intra prediction modes, which is then used in a multi-level arithmetic codec. This work involves aspects of machine learning (neural networks), computer vision (HEVC intra prediction modes), information theory (arithmetic coding), and signal processing (entropy coding). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.MM (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
