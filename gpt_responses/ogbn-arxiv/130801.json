This involves addressing issues related to massive connectivity, sporadic transmission, and small-sized data packets in future cellular communication. The proposed solution involves a deep neural network-aided message passing-based block sparse Bayesian learning algorithm. This algorithm combines techniques from machine learning, signal processing, and communication systems. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
