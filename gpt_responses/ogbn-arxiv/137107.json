The method proposed involves minimizing the automaton on-the-fly, which is a technique commonly used in data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of lexicographical ordering, which is a common technique in algorithms and data structures (cs.AI) as well as information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
