The use of extension theorems and Gray maps suggests a connection to coding theory (cs.CC). The mention of weight enumerators and parameters such as \u03b3 and 3-(80, 16, 665) designs further supports this. The use of circulant codes and the modification of a lower bound on the number of non-isomorphic designs suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The mention of distance preserving maps and the search for extremal codes suggests a connection to cryptography (cs.CR) and numerical analysis (cs.NA), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
