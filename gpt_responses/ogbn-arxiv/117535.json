The paper also specifically addresses problems in continuous control, which is a subfield of robotics (cs.RO) that deals with controlling physical systems with continuous state and action spaces. The proposed method involves regularizing the behavior of the policy, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for improving generalization and reducing overfitting. The paper also discusses the stability of the learned policies, which is a key concern in control theory (cs.SY) when dealing with physical systems. Finally, the paper uses deep neural networks as function approximators, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE) for learning complex mappings between inputs and outputs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
