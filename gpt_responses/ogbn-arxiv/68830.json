The proposed GLA-Net is an end-to-end network for mismatch removal, which suggests that the paper belongs to the computer vision sub-category. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a novel loss function that is guided by the Fn-score, which is a performance metric commonly used in machine learning. Additionally, the paper uses deep learning-based methods to solve the mismatch removal task, which further supports the inclusion of this paper in the machine learning sub-category. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes a novel attention mechanism to address the issue of outliers impairing global context in mismatch removal networks. Attention mechanisms are commonly used in artificial intelligence applications, which suggests that this paper could belong to the AI sub-category. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with feature-based tasks, which are commonly used in multimedia applications such as image and video processing. Additionally, the proposed GLA-Net is an end-to-end network for mismatch removal, which suggests that the paper could belong to the multimedia sub-category. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper proposes a novel approach to address the issue of outliers impairing global context in mismatch removal networks.
