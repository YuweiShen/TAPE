The paper also covers topics such as training data, feature representation, and machine learning models, which are all relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of motion capture data and evaluation methods suggest a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the focus on non-linear and interactive media such as video games suggests a potential connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
