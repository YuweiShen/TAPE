The paper also proposes a queuing-based model and a fast and efficient solution strategy, which are related to system optimization and control (cs.SY). The paper also deals with the mapping of requirements of verticals into decisions concerning the network infrastructure, which is related to information theory (cs.IT). The paper also deals with resource allocation and traffic routing, which are related to distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper proposes a solution strategy called MaxZ, which is related to artificial intelligence and optimization (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
