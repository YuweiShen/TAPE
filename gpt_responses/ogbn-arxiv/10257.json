The paper also mentions the use of a parameter server architecture, which is commonly used in distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper deals with decentralized data owned by different data providers, which could fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the issue of data privacy and leakage, which could fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR).
