Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also discusses lambda calculus and call/cc control operator, which are topics in programming languages and compilers, making cs.PL (Programming Languages) another likely category. The use of primitive numerals for faster computations and the discussion of implementation suggest cs.IT (Information Theory) as a possible category. The paper also deals with techniques for witness extraction, which could fall under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
