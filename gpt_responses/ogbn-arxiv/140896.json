Additionally, the use of deep learning models for this task suggests a focus on computer vision. The paper also mentions the use of robot navigators, which suggests a potential overlap with the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The use of weak supervision in the training process suggests a potential overlap with the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with 3D scene reconstruction, which suggests a potential overlap with the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
