This involves adapting to the dynamics of the underlying graph of the environment and capturing the interplay between agents using relation representations. This work is highly relevant to the fields of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multi-agent systems (cs.MA), social and information networks (cs.SI), and computational linguistics (cs.CL) as it involves learning representations of complex interactions between agents in dynamic environments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
