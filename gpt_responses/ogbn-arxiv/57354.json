The paper also discusses the convergence of these algorithms, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of shifting experts, which is a technique commonly used in online learning and prediction (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the bandit setting, which is a subfield of reinforcement learning and decision making (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
