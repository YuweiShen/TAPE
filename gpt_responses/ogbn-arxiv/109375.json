This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms. \n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper mentions social networks as one of the types of graphs on which the proposed framework is tested. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks. \n3. cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the runtime complexity of graph analysis algorithms and how it can be kept under control by using a sample instead of the whole population. This may be relevant to the sub-category of software engineering. \n4. cs.DB (Databases): The paper deals with sampling and estimating graph properties, which are important tasks in database management. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the sub-category of databases. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a framework for big-graph analytics, which may have applications in various fields such as computational engineering, finance, and science. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the sub-category of computational engineering, finance, and science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
