The paper also uses concepts from machine learning (cs.LG) and dynamical systems (cs.DS) to establish the stable embedding conditions. Additionally, the paper presents simulations to explore the convergence speed of the stable embedding, which falls under numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper discusses the value of stable embeddings for estimating the attractor dimension from time-series data, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
