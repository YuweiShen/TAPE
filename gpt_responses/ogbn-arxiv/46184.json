The use of multiple rounds and the focus on minimizing sample complexity suggests a connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as well as statistical learning theory (cs.LG). The analysis of the trade-off between round complexities and sample complexities is related to information theory (cs.IT) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
