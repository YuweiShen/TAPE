The analysis involves complex Gaussian quadratic forms, which are commonly used in signal processing (cs.SI) and signal analysis (cs.SP). Additionally, the paper presents alternative expressions in matrix format, which could be relevant to matrix manipulation and computation (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
