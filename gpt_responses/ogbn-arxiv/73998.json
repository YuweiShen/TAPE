The paper also discusses the benefits and limitations of different pipelines, which involves algorithmic and optimization aspects, potentially falling under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential applications of depth reconstruction in robotics (cs.RO) and graphics (cs.GR), which are also relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
