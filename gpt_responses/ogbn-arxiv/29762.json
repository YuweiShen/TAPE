Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves resource allocation and optimization problems, which are related to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) technology and comparison with orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDM) suggests the involvement of cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.AR (Augmented Reality)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
