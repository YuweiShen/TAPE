This suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory sub-category.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with cooperative transmission aided by a decode-and-forward (DF) relay, which is a common technique in networking and internet architecture. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture sub-category.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper proposes a protocol for cooperative transmission, which is a common technique in social and information networks. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Social and Information Networks sub-category.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with downlink OFDMA transmission, which is a common technique in multimedia applications. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Multimedia sub-category.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a polynomial-complexity resource allocation algorithm, which involves computational engineering.
