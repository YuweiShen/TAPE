Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the computational complexity of finding optimal policies, which suggests that it may belong to cs.LG (machine learning) and cs.DS (data structures and algorithms). Additionally, the paper deals with control policies in the context of systems and control theory, which suggests that it may belong to cs.SY (systems and control) and cs.MA (multi-agent systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
