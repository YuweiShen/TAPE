The paper also introduces and studies the notion of Bilu-Linial stability, which is a concept that has been extensively studied in the context of other combinatorial optimization problems. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.GT (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
