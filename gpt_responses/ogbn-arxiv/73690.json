Specifically, the paper focuses on named entity recognition (NER) in low-resource languages, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also proposes techniques for modulating transfer, which involves machine learning and optimization, and could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper evaluates its techniques using ensembling and oracle selection, which are common methods in deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
