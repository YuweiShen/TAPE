Specifically, it focuses on code-mixed data, which is a common phenomenon in multilingual societies. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. Additionally, the paper uses machine learning techniques, such as translation and transliteration models, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the use of language models and error analysis, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
