The paper also introduces a new structural measure called fracture backdoors, which could fall under the cs.DS sub-category. The development of exact and approximation algorithms for computing fracture backdoors suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.CC sub-category. The parameterized algorithms for ILP and the matching lower bounds could fall under the cs.LG sub-category. Finally, the study of the complexity landscape of ILP with respect to fracture backdoors could also belong to the cs.DM sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
