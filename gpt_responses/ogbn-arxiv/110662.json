The use of logic programs and update policies also suggests a connection to databases (cs.DB) and computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the investigation of semantical and computational properties points to a possible connection to computational complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
