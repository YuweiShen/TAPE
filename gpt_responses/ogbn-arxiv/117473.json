The use of query expansion and diffusion also suggests information retrieval (cs.IR) as a possible sub-category. The paper also mentions an efficient off-line stage and sparse linear system solver, indicating machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) as potential sub-categories. Finally, the use of CNN representations and handling of unseen queries suggests artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
