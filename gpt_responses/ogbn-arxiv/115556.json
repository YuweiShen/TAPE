This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, the proposed control method involves optimization algorithms that can be considered as a form of machine learning. Additionally, the paper mentions that the proposed algorithms can be adopted as a tool for solving optimization problems in existing optimization-based control methods, which may involve machine learning techniques.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Similar to the reasoning for cs.LG, the proposed optimization algorithms can be considered as a form of artificial intelligence. Additionally, the paper mentions that the proposed control method contributes to the sustainability of global energy systems, which is a topic of interest in the AI community.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper mentions that the proposed algorithms are scalable and can generate near-optimal solutions in near real time. This suggests that the algorithms may be suitable for distributed, parallel, or cluster computing environments.\n- cs.OH (Other Computer Science): This category is a catch-all for papers that do not fit into any of the other arXiv CS sub-categories.
