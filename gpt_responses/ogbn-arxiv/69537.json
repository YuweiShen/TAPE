The proposed method involves a deep ranking model that produces a spherical score map of composition per video segment. This paper involves computer vision (CV) techniques for video summarization and machine learning (MM) for the deep ranking model. It also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques for selecting the most suitable view for highlight detection. The paper also involves some aspects of deep learning (LG) for the proposed model. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV, cs.MM, cs.IR, cs.MM, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
