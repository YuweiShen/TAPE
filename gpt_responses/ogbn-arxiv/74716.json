The paper also proposes a novel CNN architecture for joint learning of local and global features, which involves optimization of multiple losses, indicating a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of generic matching metrics such as L2 distance, indicating a possible focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.
