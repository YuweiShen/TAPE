However, given the focus on evaluating feature attribution methods, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the use of image data in the proposed dataset and models suggests that cs.CV (Computer Vision) may also be a relevant sub-category. The evaluation metrics used in the paper also involve natural language processing, which could place it in the cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-category. Finally, the focus on safe deployment of machine learning systems could potentially place it in the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
