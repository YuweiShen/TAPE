The paper also mentions simulation results, which suggests that it may fall under computer vision (cs.CV) as well. Finally, the paper proposes a factorization approach to contextual policy search, which involves modeling the environment and task objectives separately, which could be relevant to the sub-category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
