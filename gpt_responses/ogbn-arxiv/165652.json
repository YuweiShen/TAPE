The proposed method uses a differentiable classification function and is demonstrated using Gaussian kernel SVMs. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper addresses the problem of inverse classification, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence that deals with manipulating instances to conform to a specific class. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper applies the proposed method to a real-world cardiovascular disease dataset, which suggests that the method may have applications in computer vision and pattern recognition. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly mention cryptography or security, but the proposed method could potentially have applications in these fields. For example, the method could be used to manipulate instances to evade detection by security systems. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a general framework and method for inverse classification that can accommodate different types of features and feature-value ranges. This suggests that the method may have applications in data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
