The codes are also suitable for secret sharing schemes, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The use of defining sets and weight enumerators also suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to computer communications (cs.CC) and signal processing (cs.SI) due to the potential applications of the constructed codes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
