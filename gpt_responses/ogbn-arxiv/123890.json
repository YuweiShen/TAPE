The paper proposes a novel framework for experience replay optimization and conducts experiments on various continuous control tasks. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
