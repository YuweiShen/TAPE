The use of graphs and algorithms for building hierarchical image similarity graphs suggests a potential fit for multimedia (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.DL) sub-categories. The visual sorting and manipulation of images also suggests a potential fit for graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
