The paper also mentions augmented, virtual, and mixed-reality technologies, which are often studied in computer graphics (cs.GR) and computer vision (cs.CV). The use of sensors embedded in the environment suggests a connection to cyber-physical systems (cs.CY) and the need for data analysis and machine learning in spatial computing points to the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
