The paper also presents a lower bound for the size of non-deterministic complement of an unambiguous automaton, which involves complexity theory and computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of sweeping deterministic automata suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS). The paper also involves some mathematical proofs and logic, which could be categorized under cs.LO (logic in computer science) or cs.IT (information theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
