It also involves generating velocity commands for grippers, which is a common task in robotics. The paper also uses machine learning techniques such as Multi-Armed Bandit and Kalman Filtering, which are commonly used in robotics research. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it involves machine learning techniques. \n\nThe Learning (cs.LG) sub-category is also likely as the paper proposes a framework that estimates changes in the utility of each model and balances exploration and exploitation. \n\nThe Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category is possible as the paper may involve visual perception of the deformable object. \n\nFinally, the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category is possible as the paper involves controlling the grippers to manipulate the deformable object."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
