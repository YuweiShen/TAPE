The paper also involves mathematical modeling and analysis of power spectrum measurements, which falls under information theory (IT) and mathematical analysis (MA). The paper proposes a technique for interference avoidance, which can be seen as a control system (SY) problem. Finally, the paper applies the proposed technique to an opportunistic transmission technique, which involves multimedia (MM) communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
