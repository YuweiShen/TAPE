The paper also discusses the use of polynomial constraints and real nonlinear arithmetic, which are topics related to computational geometry (cs.CG). Additionally, the paper evaluates its approach in comparison with other contemporary spatial reasoning systems, which could fall under the category of robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses the formalization of concepts of default spatial reasoning, which could also be related to mathematical logic (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
