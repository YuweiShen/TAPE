The paper also proposes two learning algorithms for traditional transfer learning and deep transfer learning. The experiments are conducted on digits recognition, sentiment analysis, and image classification, which are all related to machine learning and computer vision. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
