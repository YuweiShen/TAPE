This topic is closely related to the field of networked systems and communication, which falls under the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of statistical learning to estimate the best beam for communication, which is related to the fields of information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper specifically focuses on the 60 GHz band, which is a key aspect of millimeter wave communications and could potentially fall under the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
