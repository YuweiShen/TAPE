These problems are related to data structures, databases, and distributed computing, which are covered by several arXiv CS sub-categories. Specifically, cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) is the most likely category as the paper focuses on parallel algorithms with low communication volume. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DB (Databases) are also likely categories as the paper deals with finding relevant elements in a set and frequent objects. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) is a possible category as the paper presents algorithms for selection problems with multiple criteria. Finally, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) is a possible category as the paper deals with finding the most relevant elements in a set, which can be a computationally complex problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
