The attack involves the injection of a backdoor into a convolutional neural network model, which is a type of deep learning model commonly used for image classification tasks (cs.CV). The paper also proposes two approaches for generating a backdoor that is hardly perceptible yet effective in poisoning the model, which involves techniques related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the stealthy nature of the attack, which relates to the topic of social and information networks (cs.SI) as it involves the manipulation of data in a way that is difficult to detect."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
