The use of wavelets and Fourier transforms also suggests a potential fit for information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.MM). Finally, the focus on storage and computation efficiency could also place this paper in the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
