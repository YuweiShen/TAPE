The paper also discusses the challenges of merging and integrating datasets, which is a common problem in database systems (cs.DB). The use of geospatial data and digital maps suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of Graphics (cs.GR). The proposed approach involves automation and limited interaction with domain experts, which suggests the use of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Finally, the paper discusses the need for scalable and rapid release solutions, which is a common concern in Software Engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
