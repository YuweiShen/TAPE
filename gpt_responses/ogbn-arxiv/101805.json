The paper proposes a distributed algorithm for learning the matching between players and arms that achieves max-min fairness while minimizing the regret. This problem involves both learning and optimization, which are central topics in machine learning and game theory. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
