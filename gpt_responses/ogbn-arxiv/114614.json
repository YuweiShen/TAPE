The use of the Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) and the optimization of the denoiser within a parametric class suggest a machine learning (cs.LG) perspective. The linear parameterization of the denoiser and the use of different kernel families suggest a numerical analysis (cs.NA) approach. Finally, the mention of the Bayesian optimal performance and the use of MMSE estimators suggest a statistics (cs.MM) perspective."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
