The paper proposes a method for learning a compact and discriminative dictionary, which involves regularization techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments conducted involve various types of visual data, such as object categorization and texture recognition, which are also relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
