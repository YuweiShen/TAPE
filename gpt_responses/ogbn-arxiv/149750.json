The paper uses algebraic techniques and finite fields, which are common in information theory (cs.IT) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the properties of these functions, which are relevant to cryptography (cs.CR). The paper involves combinatorial constructions, which are relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper discusses the self-dual property of bent functions, which is relevant to signal processing and information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
