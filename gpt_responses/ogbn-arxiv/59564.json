As such, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel approach for combining global aggregation and local distribution, which involves estimating the size of each pattern at each position in the network as a per-channel mask map. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Furthermore, the paper discusses the use of GALD in object detection and instance segmentation, which could place it in the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper's use of end-to-end training and its focus on improving performance could also make it relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
