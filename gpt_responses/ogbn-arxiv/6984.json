It also mentions a table-top object reaching task where a 7 DoF arm is controlled in velocity mode to reach a blue cuboid in clutter through visual observations, which is a typical robotic task. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes an approach to reduce the cost of labelling real data, which is a common problem in machine learning. \n\nComputer Vision (cs.CV) is another likely sub-category as the proposed approach involves transferring policies from simulation to the real world through visual observations. \n\nArtificial Intelligence (cs.AI) is also a possible sub-category as the paper proposes a method for learning visuo-motor policies, which is a common problem in AI. \n\nFinally, Systems and Control (cs.SY) is another possible sub-category as the paper deals with controlling a robotic arm to reach a target object, which is a typical problem in systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
