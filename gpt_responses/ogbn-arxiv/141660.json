Additionally, it may also belong to cs.SD (Sound) as it deals with speech recognition. The paper also introduces novel techniques for training deep LSTMs, which may fall under the category of cs.LG (Learning) or cs.SI (Signal Processing). Finally, the paper proposes efficient algorithms for training these networks, which may also fall under the category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
