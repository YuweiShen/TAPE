The paper also focuses on generating discrete structures, such as text sequences and discretized images, which are relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper uses generative adversarial training, which is a popular technique in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
