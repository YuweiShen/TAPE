The use of antenna arrays and beamforming also suggests a possible connection to systems and control (cs.SY). The use of millimeter wave frequencies is a key aspect of the paper, which could place it in the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a compressive approach to channel estimation, which could be related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
