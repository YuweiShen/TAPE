Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves training sentence representations using large-scale data, which is a common technique in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. Additionally, the paper uses experimental results and performance evaluation, which are common in computer vision (CV) and neural networks (NE), making cs.CV and cs.NE possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
