It also involves experiments on various benchmark datasets to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as GNNs are widely used in AI applications, and this paper proposes a new architecture for GNNs. \n\nThe paper also involves experiments on image datasets, which suggests it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). \n\nAs the paper deals with graph-structured data, it could also belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
