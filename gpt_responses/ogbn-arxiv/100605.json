This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with improving the performance of wireless networks using a new technique for relaying data. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with improving the performance of wireless networks, which is a type of social network. This falls under the domain of social and information networks.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new technique for improving the performance of wireless networks, which involves controlling the phase of the transmitted signals. This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with improving the performance of wireless networks, which is important for multimedia applications that require high bandwidth and low latency.
