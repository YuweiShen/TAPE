Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses a neural MT system, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (AI), making cs.AI the second likely sub-category. The evaluation method used in the paper involves creating a blacklist of literal translations, which is a machine learning technique, making cs.LG (Learning) the third likely sub-category. The paper also uses a dataset and performs an evaluation, which falls under the categories of data mining and information retrieval, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) the fourth and fifth likely sub-categories, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
