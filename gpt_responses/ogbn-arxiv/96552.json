This suggests a logical and categorical approach to the topic.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages) is also likely as the paper discusses the use of monads for structuring effectful features of computation, which is a common topic in programming language research.\n- cs.CT (Category Theory) is another likely category as the paper involves a generalisation of monads using category theory concepts such as functors and morphisms.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering) is a possible category as the paper discusses the use of monads for program logics, which is relevant to software verification and testing.\n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) is a possible category as the paper involves the study of effect systems, which is related to the formal language theory concept of type systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
