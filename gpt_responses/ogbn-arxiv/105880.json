Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses implementation details specific to the Python ecosystem, which could fall under cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the library is often used for tasks such as image classification, which could fall under cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
