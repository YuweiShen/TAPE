The paper also introduces a new bound on how much information can be extracted per query about the forgotten cohort from a black-box network, which is related to information theory and falls under the category of artificial intelligence. The paper mentions the use of Neural Tangent Kernels, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision and falls under the category of computer vision. The paper also discusses the use of differential equations, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks and falls under the category of neural engineering. Finally, the paper mentions the use of noise tailored to the geometry of the loss landscape, which is a technique commonly used in natural language processing and falls under the category of computational linguistics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
