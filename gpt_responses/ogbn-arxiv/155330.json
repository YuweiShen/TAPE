The paper presents a new adaptive tester for this problem, which could be of interest to researchers in this sub-category.\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new algorithm for testing monotonicity of Boolean functions, which could be of interest to researchers in this sub-category.\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses concepts from information theory, such as total influence, in the analysis of the proposed algorithm. This could make it relevant to researchers in this sub-category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The problem of testing monotonicity of Boolean functions is related to the concept of monotonicity in machine learning.
