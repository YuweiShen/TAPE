Therefore, cs.SE (Software Engineering) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also introduces an abstraction of HTML5 applications based on monotonic tree-rewriting, which suggests that cs.PL (Programming Languages) could also be a relevant sub-category. The paper establishes the precise complexity of the problem and various subproblems of practical importance, which could fall under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Finally, the paper relies on an efficient reduction to an analysis of symbolic pushdown systems, which could be related to cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
