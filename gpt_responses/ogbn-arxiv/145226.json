The paper also discusses cooperation and cognitive message sharing, which are techniques used in communication systems (cs.SY) and signal processing (cs.MM). Finally, the paper uses mathematical analysis to derive the degrees of freedom, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
