The paper also focuses on machine learning techniques and optimization using TensorFlow, which suggests the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) and cryptographic protocols also indicates the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The paper deals with genomic data, which suggests the category of databases (cs.DB).
