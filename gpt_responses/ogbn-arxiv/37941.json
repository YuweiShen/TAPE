This falls under the scope of AI.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): Although the paper does not explicitly mention robotics, the concept of trajectory planning is closely related to robotics. The proposed algorithm can be applied to the design of trajectories for spacecraft, which can be considered as robots in space.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the problem of finding an optimal sequence of swing-bys, deep space manoeuvres, and transfer arcs connecting celestial bodies. This can be seen as a control problem, where the objective is to control the spacecraft's trajectory to achieve a desired outcome.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a computational approach to the design of optimal multiple gravity assist trajectories, which is relevant to the field of computational engineering.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper does not directly relate to programming languages, but the proposed algorithm can be implemented using a programming language."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
