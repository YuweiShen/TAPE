Additionally, the paper mentions the use of natural language processing techniques to handle subjective queries, which suggests it could also belong to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) category. The focus on user experience and the need to combine subjective and objective attributes makes the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) category a likely choice as well. The paper also mentions the use of data and the need to handle queries efficiently, which could place it in the Databases (cs.DB) category. Finally, the use of machine learning techniques to provide insights into user choices could make the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category a possible fit."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
