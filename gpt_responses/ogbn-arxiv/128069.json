The paper discusses strategies to encode system and reference texts to devise a metric that shows a high correlation with human judgment of text quality. The paper also validates the new metric, MoverScore, on a number of text generation tasks including summarization, machine translation, image captioning, and data-to-text generation, where the outputs are produced by a variety of neural and non-neural systems. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
