The paper also introduces a new probabilistic action language (cs.PL) and applies it to the design of a system (cs.MA) that compiles a pBC+ action description into a POMDP model. Finally, the paper's focus on decision-making and planning suggests that it could also be relevant to the robotics community (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
