However, since the focus is on capacity limits and throughput analysis, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely categories. The paper also discusses user selection and interference management, which are relevant to cs.SY. The use of multiple antennas is a key aspect of the paper, which is relevant to cs.MM. Finally, the paper deals with cognitive radio networks, which involve security and privacy issues, making cs.CR a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
