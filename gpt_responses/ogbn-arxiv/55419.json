The paper also addresses the issue of computational resource restrictions, which is a common concern in embedded systems, making it relevant to the category of embedded systems (cs.EM). The paper also discusses the synthesis of control software, which is a software engineering task, making it relevant to the category of software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also mentions the use of quantization schema, which is related to programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). Finally, the paper discusses the optimization of non-functional requirements, such as optimal set-up time and footprint, which is related to the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
