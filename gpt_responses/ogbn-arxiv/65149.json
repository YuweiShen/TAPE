The paper also derives a new expression for the Cramer-Rao lower bound, which is a fundamental concept in information theory. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper develops an iterative expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate unknown parameters of a parametric field, which is a common problem in systems and control. \n3. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper deals with a homogeneous sensor network, which can be considered as a multi-agent system. The paper also develops a distributed estimator for the field, which is a common problem in multi-agent systems. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the problem of data transmission in a sensor network, which is a common problem in networking and internet architecture. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with a sensor network, which can be considered as a social network of sensors. The paper also analyzes the performance of the distributed estimator as a function of the number of sensors in the network, which is a common problem in social and information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
