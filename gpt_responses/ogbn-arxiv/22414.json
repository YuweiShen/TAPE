This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of avoiding collisions and deadlocks, which are common issues in robotics (cs.RO). The paper also reformulates the problem as a distributed resource allocation problem, which suggests that it may belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The paper proposes modifications to an existing algorithm, which suggests that it may belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a method that does not require robots to know or estimate the speed profiles of other robots, which suggests that it may belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
