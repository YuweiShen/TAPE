It also involves the use of meta-learning algorithms (cs.AI) and parameter sharing (cs.NE) to accelerate the architecture search process. Additionally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on image datasets (Mini-ImageNet and Omniglot), which suggests it may also be relevant to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
