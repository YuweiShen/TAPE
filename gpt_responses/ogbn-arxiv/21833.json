The proposed algorithm for aggregating multiple collections into a single hierarchical topic model involves techniques from deep learning (cs.DL) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of a web service to demonstrate the concept of topical exploratory search suggests a focus on web-based applications (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
