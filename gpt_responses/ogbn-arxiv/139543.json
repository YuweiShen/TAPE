This task requires correctly labeling each extracted object and their interaction relationships. The paper proposes a novel Attentive Relational Network that consists of two key modules with an object detection backbone to approach this problem. The first module is a semantic transformation module utilized to capture semantic embedded relation features, by translating visual features and linguistic features into a common semantic space. The other module is a graph self-attention module introduced to embed a joint graph representation through assigning various importance weights to neighboring nodes. Finally, accurate scene graphs are produced by the relation inference module to recognize all entities and the corresponding relations. Given the focus on computer vision and natural language processing, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves semantic embedding and graph representation, which suggests that it could belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
