The paper also discusses the log-loss distortion criterion, which is a common measure in machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper's focus on low mutual information suggests a potential connection to compressed sensing (cs.SI) and data compression (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
