The concept of fan-planar graphs is a variant of other classes defined by forbidden intersection patterns in a topological drawing of the graph, which suggests that it could belong to cs.CG (Computational Geometry) or cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The paper also discusses the maximum number of edges in a fan-planar graph, which is a combinatorial problem, indicating that it could belong to cs.GT (Graph Theory) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper mentions the recent work on nearly-planar graphs, which is a topic in graph drawing and visualization, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
