Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses OOB emission minimization, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SP). The paper also discusses the joint design of GFDM filter and window, which falls under the category of communication networks (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the effect of CFO on GFDM, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the tradeoff between transmission rate and OOB radiation, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
