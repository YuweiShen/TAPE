This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT), signal processing (cs.SP), and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the computational complexity of the proposed method, which relates to numerical analysis (cs.NA), and the use of partial Fourier and Hadamard matrices, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
