Additionally, the paper involves the extraction of visual features from facial regions, which falls under the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The use of deep features also suggests that the paper may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of a discriminative learning framework, which falls under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the collection of a new dataset, which suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
