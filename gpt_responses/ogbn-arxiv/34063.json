Therefore, cs.DB is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves logical reasoning and complexity analysis, which suggests cs.LO and cs.CC as likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of additional operators and features on dynamic expressiveness, which is a topic relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
