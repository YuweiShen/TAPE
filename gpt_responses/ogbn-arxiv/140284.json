The paper specifically focuses on modeling scope-limited features, which are relevant to NLP tasks such as information extraction from web pages. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes a hierarchical probabilistic model, which involves estimating unobserved random parameters, and uses both local and global features for classification. This makes the paper relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
