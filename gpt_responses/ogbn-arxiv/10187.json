The paper also introduces a new module for feature renormalization and mask-updating, which involves learning attention maps, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper presents qualitative and quantitative experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and graphics (cs.GR) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
