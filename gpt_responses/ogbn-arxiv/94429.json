The paper also mentions the use of proprioceptive measurements, which are related to computer vision (cs.CV) and the improvement of localization and mapping processes, which is related to control systems (cs.SY). The paper proposes a generic approach that could be coupled with conventional SLAM algorithms, which involves the use of mathematical tools such as the topological degree, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
