The use of neural networks for filling in missing data and eliminating redundancies suggests that it could also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also addresses image registration and texture-aware remeshing, which suggests that it could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.
