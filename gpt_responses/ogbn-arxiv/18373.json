Additionally, the paper specifically mentions the application of this technology in the field of autonomous driving (cs.RO), which further supports the likelihood of cs.CV being the primary sub-category. The use of transfer learning and deep learning algorithms also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI), while the use of datasets and experimental results suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
