The use of asymmetric debates and the analysis of the performance of deterministic and probabilistic provers involve information theory (cs.IT) and logic (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the membership problem for languages, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the comparison with single-prover and competing-prover interactive proof systems relates to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
