This involves reweighting the source data based on the attribute prior. The paper also provides theoretical analysis and experimental results. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
