The proposed method involves the use of deep learning techniques, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of feature refinement to improve detection performance, which is related to robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
