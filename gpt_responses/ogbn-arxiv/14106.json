The authors also mention the use of data structures to efficiently compute the drawings (cs.DS). The paper involves graph theory and combinatorics, which are relevant to the sub-categories cs.GT and cs.DM. Finally, the authors mention the potential applications of their method in information visualization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
