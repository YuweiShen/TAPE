The paper proposes a new strategy for improving the performance of cascaded regression, which is a popular technique in face alignment. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques, such as discriminative classifiers, to evaluate and improve the quality of training examples. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe paper uses benchmark datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia). \n\nFinally, the paper is focused on improving the accuracy and robustness of face alignment, which is an important application in human-computer interaction. Therefore, it may also belong to the sub-category cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
