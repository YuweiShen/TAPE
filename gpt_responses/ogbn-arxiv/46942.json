DLs are widely used in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and databases (DB), which makes cs.AI and cs.DB likely sub-categories. The paper also presents a constraint propagation calculus for reasoning, which is related to logic (cs.LO) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper deals with concepts and reasoning, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
