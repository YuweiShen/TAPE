Specifically, the paper introduces a novel measure that models the alignment of time-series indices in a deep representation space, which suggests that it may fall under the categories of deep learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
