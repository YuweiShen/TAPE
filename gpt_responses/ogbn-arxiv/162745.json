The policies are parameterized in a differentiable way and optimized using policy gradients, which is a popular machine learning technique. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel approach for solving the bandit exploration problem, which is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence. The approach involves learning bandit policies from a sample of bandit instances using meta-learning and policy gradients. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses various bandit policy classes, including a novel soft-elimination policy that has regret guarantees. The paper also introduces novel variance reduction techniques to make policy gradients practical. These techniques involve designing efficient data structures and algorithms for computing gradients. \n4. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper experiments with various bandit policy classes, including neural networks. The experiments show that neural network policies can learn implicit biases, which are only expressed through sampled bandit instances during training. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a policy optimization approach for solving the bandit exploration problem, which can be viewed as a control problem. The approach involves learning policies that maximize the average reward over bandit instances drawn"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
