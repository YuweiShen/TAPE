Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also focuses on deep neural networks, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), or cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper proposes a general framework for embedding a watermark in model parameters, which could be related to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
