This scenario falls under the category of network MIMO with partial cooperation, which is a subfield of wireless communication and networking. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the mathematical foundations of communication and information processing. \n\nThe paper also involves the optimization of linear beamforming strategies at the BSs and users, which falls under the category of signal processing and optimization. Therefore, the next likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SI (Signal Processing), and cs.MM (Multimedia). \n\nFinally, the paper involves the comparison of different schemes through extensive numerical simulations, which falls under the category of machine learning and data analysis.
