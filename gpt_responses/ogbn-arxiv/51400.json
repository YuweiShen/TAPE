The paper focuses on the use of multilinear discriminant analysis (MLDA) and binary hashing for feature pooling. These topics are commonly studied in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of histograms for feature pooling suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning algorithms and evaluations on a database suggest a potential connection to neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
