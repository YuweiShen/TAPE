The use of the Djokovic relation and partial cubes suggests a connection to graph theory (cs.DS) and graph algorithms (cs.CC). The fact that the paper focuses on plane graphs and presents a polynomial-time algorithm for finding all convex cuts suggests a possible connection to computational topology (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
