It also incorporates natural language processing (NLP) techniques to improve tracking performance, which falls under the category of natural language processing (cs.CL). The proposed method uses deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with robotics applications, specifically object tracking in real-time, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
