It may also belong to cs.SE (Software Engineering) as it discusses the use of formalisms to manage risk and maintain documentation throughout the system lifecycle. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of logical relationships and templates, which are common in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and social networks (cs.SI).
