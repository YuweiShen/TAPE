Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques for finding relevant information from online forums, which makes cs.IR a likely sub-category as well. The use of contextual embedding models like BERT and self-supervised learning techniques suggest that the paper could also belong to cs.LG (Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper involves analyzing and adapting to low-resource settings, which could make cs.CY (Computers and Society) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
