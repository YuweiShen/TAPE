This involves computer vision (CV) techniques such as feature extraction and depth estimation. The paper also uses a rendering engine (GR) to create a synthetic light field dataset. Additionally, the paper involves machine learning (MM) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for the proposed deep learning framework. Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed method quantitatively and qualitatively, which falls under machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) subfields of computer science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
