It specifically focuses on the Gaussian channel, which is a common model in signal processing (cs.SP) and communication systems (cs.NI). The use of quantization and dithering is also a common technique in multimedia processing (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SP). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the channel capacity, which is a topic in statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
