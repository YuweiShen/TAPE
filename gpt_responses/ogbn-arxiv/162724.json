Additionally, the paper proposes regularizers to improve the performance of single-step adversarial training methods, which suggests that it is likely to belong to the cs.LG sub-category. The paper also discusses the susceptibility of machine learning models to adversarial samples, which suggests that it is likely to belong to the cs.AI sub-category. The paper proposes methods to defend against adversarial attacks, which suggests that it is likely to belong to the cs.CR sub-category.
