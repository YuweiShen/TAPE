The use of continuous functions and piece-wise interval approximations suggests cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), while the mention of algorithms and satisfiability checking suggests cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The use of perturbations and the notion of degree suggests cs.MS (Mathematical Software), and the use of approximations suggests cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
