The use of publication and citation data suggests that cs.DL (Digital Libraries) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are likely sub-categories. The normalization of differences among disciplines and the comparison of different journals suggest cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.CY (Computers and Society) as possible sub-categories. Finally, the suggestion of ways to visualize differences in citing audiences suggests cs.SD (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
