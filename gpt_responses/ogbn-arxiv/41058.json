The paper also discusses ensemble methods and their efficiency, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep networks and their training is also relevant to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with large-scale datasets and their processing, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
