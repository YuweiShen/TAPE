The paper also discusses the input distribution of the random variable and its effect on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE), which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and mathematical modeling (cs.MM). The paper also derives expressions for the derivatives of the MMSE with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which involves numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
