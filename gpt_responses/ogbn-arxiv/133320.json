This falls under the scope of natural language processing and computational linguistics, which are sub-areas of cs.CL.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with analyzing social media data (specifically, Sina Weibo) to detect suicidal ideation and alert appropriate support groups. This falls under the scope of social and information networks, which is a sub-area of cs.SI.\n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a real-time suicidal ideation detection system deployed over Weibo, which involves software engineering aspects such as system design, implementation, and evaluation. This falls under the scope of software engineering, which is a sub-area of cs.SD.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper addresses a societal issue (suicide prevention) and proposes a technical solution (using machine learning and psychological lexicons) to tackle it. This falls under the scope of computers and society, which is a sub-area of cs.CY.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper involves applying computational techniques (machine learning, linguistic analysis) to a real-world problem (suicide prevention) in a specific domain (Chinese microblogs).
