Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also presents detailed correctness proofs and annotated versions for verifiers, which suggests that it could belong to cs.PL (Programming Languages) or cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of the algorithms in different verifiers, which could make it relevant to cs.SE (Software Engineering) or cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
