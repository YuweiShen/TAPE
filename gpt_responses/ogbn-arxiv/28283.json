Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves optimization of transmission policies and performance evaluation, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper proposes an alternative coexistence paradigm that improves performance without harming WiFi, which involves system design and control (cs.SY) and security and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
