The authors also mention the use of batch normalization, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) applications. The concept of asymmetric valleys is related to the geometry of the loss landscape, which is a topic of interest in neural engineering (cs.NE) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
