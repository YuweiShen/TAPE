The survey was focused on the arXiv platform, which is a repository of electronic preprints of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, and quantitative finance. Given the focus on user feedback and the platform's multidisciplinary nature, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.CY (Computers and Society), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
