This method is specifically designed for academic search tasks, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Additionally, the use of topic-specific terms and graph-based representation of the author-topic profile suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Deep Learning (cs.DL), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
