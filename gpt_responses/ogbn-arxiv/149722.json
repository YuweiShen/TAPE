The paper specifically focuses on two related strategies, noise contrastive estimation (NCE) and negative sampling, which are commonly used in NLP research. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). However, the paper also discusses the computational aspects of these techniques, which suggests that it may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of negative sampling for learning word representations, which is a common task in computer vision research, so it may also be relevant to the sub-category cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
