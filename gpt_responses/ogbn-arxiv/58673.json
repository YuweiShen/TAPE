This involves the use of algorithmic and combinatorial tools such as Lyndon words, Lyndon factorizations, fusion trees, and order isomorphism of strings. These topics are closely related to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS), formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL), information theory (cs.IT), social and information networks (cs.SI), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
