The paper covers both theoretical and practical aspects of the problem, including the impact on the theory and practice of computing, fundamental concepts and techniques, and efficient feasible MM algorithms. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), followed by cs.SC (Scientific Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
