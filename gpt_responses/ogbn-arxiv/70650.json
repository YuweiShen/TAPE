This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a new detection algorithm that reduces computation complexity, which could be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and computer engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the paper mentions the use of codebooks for sparse code multiple access, which could be related to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
