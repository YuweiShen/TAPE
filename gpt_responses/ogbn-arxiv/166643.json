The paper specifically focuses on weight-sharing in NAS, which is a technique used to speed up the model evaluation procedure. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the interference between child models, which is related to optimization and could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
