The paper proposes an extension of a distance-based inconsistency indicator for incomplete matrices, which can be used to monitor the consistency of the decision maker's input. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including cs.MS (Mathematical Software), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
