The paper also proposes a message passing algorithmic framework, which is a popular technique in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The paper further discusses the application of the proposed algorithm in multiuser communication, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.MM) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
