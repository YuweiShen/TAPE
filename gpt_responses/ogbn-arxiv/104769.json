Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves optimization and algorithmic aspects, which suggest the categories cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also mentions numerical results, which suggest the categories cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
