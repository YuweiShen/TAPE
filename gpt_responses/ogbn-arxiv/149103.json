This suggests that the paper could belong to the Machine Learning sub-category. \n\ncs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper discusses the performance of neural networks in vision-based tasks and proposes a method to improve their robustness to visual perturbations. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition sub-category. \n\ncs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method to improve the robustness and stability of neural networks, which is a key area of research in artificial intelligence. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Artificial Intelligence sub-category. \n\ncs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper discusses the performance of neural networks and proposes a method to improve their robustness and stability. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing sub-category. \n\ncs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a general training method that can be used to make existing neural network architectures more robust and stable to input visual perturbations while using only available datasets for training.
