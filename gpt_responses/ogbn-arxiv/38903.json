This involves the use of wireless communication and information theory, which are key topics in the field of Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of caches at the edge nodes and fronthaul links, which are related to Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC). The analysis of the long-term Normalized Delivery Time (NDT) involves the use of control theory and optimization, which are topics in Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the use of pipelined transmission modes and numerical simulations, which are related to Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
