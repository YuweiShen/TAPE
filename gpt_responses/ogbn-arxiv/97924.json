The use of approximation algorithms and complexity results also points towards numerical analysis (cs.NA) and game theory (cs.GT). Finally, the mention of arboricity as a parameter for the performance guarantee of the algorithms suggests that information theory (cs.IT) could also be a relevant category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
