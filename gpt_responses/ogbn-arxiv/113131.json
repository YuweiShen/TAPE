Additionally, the paper involves modeling user engagement, which could fall under machine learning (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of EEG data also suggests a potential application of neural networks (cs.NE) in the analysis. Finally, the paper's focus on advertisement videos suggests a potential overlap with multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
