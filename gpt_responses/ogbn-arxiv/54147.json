However, since the focus is on wireless power transfer and backscatter communications, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The other categories are also relevant due to the multiuser and nonlinear aspects of the problem, as well as the potential applications in multimedia and machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
