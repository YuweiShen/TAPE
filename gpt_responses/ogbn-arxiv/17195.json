The use of Monte Carlo methods for integration is also a common technique in both of these fields. The paper also deals with optimization and approximation techniques, which are relevant to data science (cs.DS) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the use of symbolic integration, which is a topic in scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
