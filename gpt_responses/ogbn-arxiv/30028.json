The paper also applies the method to image recovery (cs.CV), which is a subfield of computer vision. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of Lipschitz denoisers, which is a concept from signal processing (cs.SP) and the method is demonstrated on parametric bilinear estimation, which could fall under the category of statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
