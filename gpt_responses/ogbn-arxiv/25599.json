The problem is of a statistical nature and involves optimization under a budget constraint. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.ST (Statistics). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the problem and suggests a tractable convex surrogate, which suggests the sub-categories cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) as possible candidates."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
