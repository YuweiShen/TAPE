This topic falls under the category of computational biology (cs.BIO) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of LCP arrays, which are commonly used in computational biology and bioinformatics. Therefore, categories such as computer engineering (cs.CE), databases (cs.DB), and machine learning (cs.LG) are also likely candidates."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
