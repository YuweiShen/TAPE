The technique is specifically designed for multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and can be applied to both centralized training and decentralized execution (cs.RO, cs.SY). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.LG and cs.AI, followed by cs.MA, cs.RO, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
