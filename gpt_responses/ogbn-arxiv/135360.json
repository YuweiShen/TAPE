The use of heuristics and the training of a heuristic policy using imitation learning falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and planning and scheduling (cs.SY). The algorithmic approach presented in the paper also involves dynamic programming, which is a technique used in programming languages and compilers (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
