The use of bipartite matching suggests that the paper may also be relevant to Computational Geometry (cs.CG) and Graph Theory (cs.GT). Finally, the mention of approximation algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to Computational Complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
