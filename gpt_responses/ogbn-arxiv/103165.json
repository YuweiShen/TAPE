The approach involves nuclear norm minimization and the use of random measurement vectors. This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computer Vision (cs.CV), Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), or Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories. However, since the paper focuses on the use of random rank-one measurements and their recovery, it is most likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
