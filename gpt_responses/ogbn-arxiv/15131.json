The problem also involves temporal graphs, which are commonly studied in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational geometry (cs.CG). Additionally, the problem involves connectivity constraints, which are relevant in the field of social networks and network science (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses techniques from complexity theory and graph theory, which are also relevant in the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
