It discusses the use of cosine window and spatial regularization in existing CF trackers and proposes a method to remove cosine window while still addressing boundary discontinuity and sample contamination. The paper extensively evaluates the proposed method on three benchmarks using handcrafted and deep CNN features. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves machine learning techniques such as regularization and optimization, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. The use of deep CNN features also suggests cs.MM (Multimedia) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the application of visual tracking in robotics can make cs.RO (Robotics) a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
