The approach proposed involves learning a feature space discriminatively by optimizing an information-theoretic metric. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and statistical learning (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
