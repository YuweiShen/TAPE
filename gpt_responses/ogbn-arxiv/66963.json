This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n3. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper deals with deep learning using neural networks, which is a subfield of neural and evolutionary computing. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new technique for deep learning which can improve the performance of CNNs. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with image classification tasks which are a part of multimedia analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
