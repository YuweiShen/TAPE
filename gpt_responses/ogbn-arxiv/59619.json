Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), followed by cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), which are both related to wireless communication. The use of machine learning also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to cs.LG (Machine Learning), while the control aspect of the problem may place it in cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the optimization of beamforming weights may also relate to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
