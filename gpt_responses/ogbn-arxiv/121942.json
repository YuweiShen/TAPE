The techniques used in the paper are combinatorial, based on LPs and enumeration of approximate min-cuts, which are commonly used in algorithms and discrete mathematics. The paper also presents NP-completeness and inapproximability results, which are typical topics in computational complexity theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
