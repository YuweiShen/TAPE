This falls under the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses domain adaptation and feature selection, which are topics commonly studied in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of surveillance cameras and low-resolution images suggests that the paper may also be relevant to Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
