It could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it evaluates and compares the accuracy of state-of-the-art object detectors. Additionally, it could be classified under Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with the transfer of knowledge between visual and non-visual domains. It could also be classified under Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) as it deals with the representation of context. Finally, it could belong to Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) as it deals with the dependence of object categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
