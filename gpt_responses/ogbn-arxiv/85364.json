Therefore, cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) are the most likely sub-categories. Additionally, cs.Distributed (Distributed Computing) and cs.PL (Programming Languages) are also relevant due to the nature of smart contracts and their execution. Finally, cs.SE (Software Engineering) is a possible sub-category as the paper proposes a new speculative execution engine for smart contracts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
