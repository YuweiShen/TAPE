The paper also employs statistical learning techniques (cs.LG) and signal processing methods (cs.SP) to analyze the performance of the $\\ell_p$-regularized least squares algorithm. Additionally, the paper uses mathematical optimization techniques (cs.NA) to study the properties of the algorithm and its convergence behavior. Finally, the paper employs statistical physics methods (cs.SI) to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the algorithm and its phase transition properties."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
