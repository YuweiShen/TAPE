Additionally, the paper discusses the practical implementation of gesture recognition in authentication systems, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also mentions computer vision (cs.CV) as a potential approach to recognizing gestures. Cybersecurity (cs.CY) is another relevant sub-category, as the paper discusses the need for reliable gesture recognition as a security layer. Finally, the paper mentions signal processing (cs.SD) as a potential approach to recognizing gestures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
