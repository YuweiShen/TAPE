The paper proposes a dynamic nested clustering algorithm to improve the scalability of baseband-processing and channel-estimation complexity, which are key challenges in large-scale C-RANs. This work involves aspects of information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), control systems (cs.SY), distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC), and architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
