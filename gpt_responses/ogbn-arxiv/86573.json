Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also models the autonomous vehicle as an intelligent agent, which falls under cs.RO (Robotics). The evaluation of perception systems involves computer vision techniques, which is covered under cs.CV (Computer Vision). The safety-critical aspect of the evaluation falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper proposes a systematic method to evaluate the integration of perception and decision-making systems, which is related to machine learning and falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
