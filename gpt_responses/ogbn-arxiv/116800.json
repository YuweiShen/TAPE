The use of neuromorphic vision sensors also involves computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SY). The paper also presents a controller design, which falls under the field of control theory (cs.NE). Finally, the paper uses optimization techniques to design the controller, which is a topic that falls under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
