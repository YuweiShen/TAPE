Compressive sensing is a topic closely related to information theory, and the paper discusses the theoretical basis of the proposed scheme in terms of sparsity and basis expansion model. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with channel estimation in large-scale MIMO systems, which is a key issue in wireless communication networks. The proposed scheme is distributed, which means it can be applied to networks with multiple nodes. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not explicitly mention social networks, but the proposed scheme can be applied to networks with multiple nodes, which is a topic of interest in social network analysis. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not use machine learning techniques, but the proposed scheme involves the use of a basis expansion model, which is a technique used in machine learning for feature extraction. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper does not deal with multimedia data, but the proposed scheme can be applied to wireless communication systems that transmit multimedia data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
