The paper proposes a novel approach to summarization based on predicting the next sentence to include in the summary using a model that takes into account the source article and the summary produced so far. This approach involves machine learning and could fall under several sub-categories of computer science. \n\ncs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely category, as it covers NLP and text summarization. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also likely, as it covers machine learning and natural language processing. cs.LG (Machine Learning) is another possibility, as the paper involves training a model to predict the next sentence in the summary. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is also relevant, as summarization is a common task in IR. Finally, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) could be a relevant category, as the paper uses neural networks to predict the next sentence in the summary."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
