Therefore, cs.CV and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves machine learning (MM) techniques for feature extraction and classification, which makes cs.MM a likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves statistical analysis (LG) for evaluating the proposed method and comparing it with existing methods. Finally, the paper involves artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for developing a more effective feature descriptor."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
