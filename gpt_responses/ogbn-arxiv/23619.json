Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of triplet loss for end-to-end training, which is a common technique in information retrieval (IR) tasks. Hence, cs.IR is also a likely sub-category. The paper introduces a learnable activation layer and multi-stream aggregation, which are related to machine learning (LG) and multimedia (MM) respectively. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of different activation functions, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (AI) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
