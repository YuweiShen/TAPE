The use of a generic, task-independent network to supplement a supervised face recognition model suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The experiments involve datasets related to plastic surgery and disguise, which are subcategories of multimedia (cs.MM) and cybersecurity (cs.CR), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
