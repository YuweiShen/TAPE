This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of SVM with a valid Gaussian kernel on the SPD manifold suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and the modeling of temporal dynamics of facial expressions suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
