It is also likely to belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as geometric registration is a key task in robotics. The paper uses deep learning techniques to learn features, which makes it likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves optimization of deep networks, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with local geometry, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
