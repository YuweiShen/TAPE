This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and comparison with other well-known CNNs also suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The study also involves the use of multi-wavelength to increase the sample size, which can be related to the data science (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the automated classification of malaria-infected stages, which can be related to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
