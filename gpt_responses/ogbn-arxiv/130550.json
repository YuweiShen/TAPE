The proposed strategy is based on exploiting multi-user diversity gain, which is a concept commonly used in wireless communication systems (cs.SI). The paper also derives a closed-form result for throughput scaling, which involves mathematical analysis and modeling (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the trade-off between cache memory size and network throughput, which is a topic related to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
