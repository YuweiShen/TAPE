The proposed method, DIFFEE, is designed to work in high-dimensional settings and is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.ST (Statistics). Additionally, the paper involves optimization and information theory, which are relevant to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
