This makes cs.DS a likely sub-category for this paper.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses an expectation-maximization algorithm for rigid graph alignment, which is a machine learning technique. Hence, cs.LG is another likely sub-category.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the application of rigid graph alignment to functional brain networks, which are a type of social and information network. Therefore, cs.SI is a possible sub-category.\n4. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses functional connectomes of the human brain as an example of rigid graphs, which is a topic related to neural computing. Hence, cs.NE is another possible sub-category.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the application of rigid graph alignment to mobile device/sensor communication logs, which is a topic related to computational engineering. Therefore, cs.CE is a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
