The experiments are conducted on image and text corpora, indicating a focus on computer vision and natural language processing. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper involves optimization and objective functions, which are also common in the sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
