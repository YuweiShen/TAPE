The proposed method is designed for hierarchical data visualization, which is a common topic in human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also discusses the performance of the algorithm in terms of computation time and aspect ratio, which are common concerns in graphics (cs.GR). The algorithm involves data structures and algorithms commonly used in computational geometry and data structures (cs.DS).
