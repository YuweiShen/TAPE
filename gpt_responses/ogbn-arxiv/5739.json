Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the optimization of the network model, which involves quantization and tensorization, indicating that it may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper uses challenging video datasets, suggesting that it may also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
