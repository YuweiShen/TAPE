It could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) as it discusses the theoretical optimal multiplexing gain. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it proposes a novel scheme for synchronization. The paper also mentions the use of FPGA, which could place it under cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
