This makes it likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses optimization algorithms and theoretical guarantees, which are relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also mentions compression rates, which could place it in the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
