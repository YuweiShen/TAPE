This is a core topic in artificial intelligence and machine learning. \n2. cs.LG - The policy used to guide the search is obtained from a neural network trained using A3C, which is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm. This makes the paper relevant to the machine learning community. \n3. cs.PL - The paper discusses the use of a cost function and sampling to guide the search, which are techniques commonly used in planning. \n4. cs.SE - The paper presents algorithms with guarantees on the number of nodes to be expanded before reaching a goal state, which is relevant to software engineering and verification. \n5. cs.RO - The paper's focus on single-agent search algorithms is relevant to robotics, where autonomous agents often need to plan and navigate in complex environments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
