It could also belong to Information Retrieval (cs.IR) as it discusses techniques for efficient search. The use of deep learning techniques suggests it could also belong to Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the introduction of a novel loss function and normalization technique suggests it could also belong to Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
