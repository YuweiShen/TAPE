The use of convex geometry and low-rank matrix recovery techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the mention of the required sampling rate growing proportionally to the condition number of the covariance matrix suggests that numerical analysis (cs.NA) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
