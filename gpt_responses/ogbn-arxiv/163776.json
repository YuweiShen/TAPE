The paper also discusses the integration of on-line justifications within the computation model of Smodels, which is a tool for logic programming and belongs to the subfield of Programming Languages (cs.PL). The concept of justifications is also related to the semantics of logic programs (cs.LO) and can be used for debugging answer set programs (cs.SE) and supporting methodologies and tools for databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
