Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves information theory (IT) in the context of noisy observations, and uses techniques from computational complexity (DS, CC) to establish lower bounds. Finally, the paper discusses the tradeoff between computational and sample complexity, which falls under the category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
