This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses few-shot learning, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The use of deep triplet networks is a novel approach to few-shot learning, which could also fall under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category.
