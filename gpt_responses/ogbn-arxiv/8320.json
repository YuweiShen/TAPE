This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) domain. The paper proposes a solution using entropic optimal transportation to mitigate the effect of inaccurately labeled samples. This involves optimizing the loss function, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) domains. The paper also mentions the use of deep neural networks, which falls under the neural networks (cs.NE) domain. Finally, the paper deals with remote sensing images, which falls under the information retrieval (cs.IR) domain."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
