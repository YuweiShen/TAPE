This involves using longitudinal scans as a form of 'free' self-supervision. The paper uses a Siamese convolutional neural network (CNN) and two losses: a contrastive loss and a classification loss. The paper also experiments on a dataset of 1016 subjects. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
