The first application discussed in the paper is related to deciding whether a graph has a perfect matching, which is a problem in graph theory and algorithms (cs.DS). The second application is related to testing the equality of two multisets of integers, which is a problem in information theory (cs.IT) and algorithms (cs.LO). The methodology involves using irrational numbers, which is a topic in numerical analysis and scientific computing (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
