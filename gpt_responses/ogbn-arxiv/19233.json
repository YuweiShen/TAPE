This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed system is a deep learning network trained with transfer learning and online random augmentation. This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an AI-based grading system for OCT images, which involves automated analysis and classification of pathological lesions. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The proposed system uses quasi random augmentation that outputs confidence values for diseases prevalence during inference. This can be seen as a form of information retrieval.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed system is designed for retinal OCT analysis, which involves medical imaging. This can be seen as a form of multimedia analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
