The use of 1-bit ADCs and DACs is a common technique in signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI) to reduce hardware complexity and power consumption. Finally, the use of multiple antennas is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM) for improving wireless communication performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
