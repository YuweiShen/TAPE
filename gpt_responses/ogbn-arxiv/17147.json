The proposed method involves transfer learning and fine-tuning of pre-trained models, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of remote sensing images also suggests the possibility of the paper being related to graphics (cs.GR) or information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
