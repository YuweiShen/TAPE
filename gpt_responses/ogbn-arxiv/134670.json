Additionally, the paper discusses differential privacy, which is a common topic in the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category. The use of generative adversarial nets (GAN) also suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of datasets, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category.
