The strategy uses pattern mining to explore high-order local search neighborhoods, which suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of frequent patterns also suggests a connection to data mining (cs.DM). The problem being addressed, the vehicle routing problem, is a classic optimization problem in operations research (cs.RO). Finally, the use of metaheuristics and optimization algorithms suggests a connection to computational intelligence (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
