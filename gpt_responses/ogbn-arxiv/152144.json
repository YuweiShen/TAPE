Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely category. The paper also proposes a new loss function for training deep neural networks, which falls under the category of machine learning, specifically deep learning. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely category. The paper also deals with large-scale datasets and surveillance cameras, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
