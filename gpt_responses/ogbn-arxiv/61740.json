This suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of linear higher-order cellular automata in secret sharing schemes, which falls under the cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-category. The study of dynamical properties of cellular automata is also relevant to the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category. Additionally, the paper provides decidable characterizations for certain properties, which is a topic in the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the equivalence between linear cellular automata and non-uniform cellular automata, which is a topic in the cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
