The paper proposes optimal coding schemes for minimizing latency in distributed computation of linear functions and mitigating the effect of stragglers, which is a problem in distributed computing (cs.DC) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also considers 3 asymptotic regimes and precisely characterizes the total run-time of the distributed algorithm and optimum coding strategy in each regime, which involves analysis and optimization (cs.IT, cs.SY). Overall, the paper spans multiple sub-categories of computer science, but cs.IT, cs.DC, cs.NI, cs.SY, and cs.LG are the most likely ones."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
