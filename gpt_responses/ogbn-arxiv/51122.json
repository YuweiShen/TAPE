This falls under the domain of multimedia.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with streaming videos over the internet and proposes an algorithm to optimize the streaming rate. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper assumes the knowledge of the viewing probability of different portions (tiles) of a panoramic scene. This requires computer vision techniques to estimate the field of view (FOV) of the user.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper proposes a stochastic optimization framework to maximize the QoE of streaming 360-degree videos. This falls under the domain of information theory.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an algorithm to optimize the streaming rate of 360-degree videos in the presence of uncertain head movement and bandwidth. This falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
