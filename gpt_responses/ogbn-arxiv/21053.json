The experiments are conducted on image classification tasks using Resnet20 architecture, which suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) is another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of hyper-parameters for QDNN training, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Additionally, the paper involves training neural networks, which is a topic that falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper involves optimization techniques for deep learning models, which is a topic that falls under the category of robotics (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
