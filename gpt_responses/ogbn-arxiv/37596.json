The method is based on a kernel cross-correlator, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG) and the paper also discusses the use of deep learning for optical flow estimation. The paper also mentions the estimation of altitude velocity and yaw rate, which are related to control and decision-making in autonomous systems, making it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
