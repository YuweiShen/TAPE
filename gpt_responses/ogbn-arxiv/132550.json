This involves the use of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for feature generation and principal component analysis (PCA) for selection of the feature subset. The classification is done using probabilistic neural network (PNN) and multilayer perceptron forward neural network (MLPFN). This work involves signal processing, machine learning, and neural networks, which are all relevant to the sub-categories of cs.IT, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.NE, and cs.SD."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
