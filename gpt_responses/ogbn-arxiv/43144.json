It may also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it specifically focuses on neural network training. Additionally, since the paper mentions experiments involving image classification, it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper's focus on optimization problems and convergence also suggests it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
