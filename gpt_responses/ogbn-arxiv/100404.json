The analysis of different mappings and algorithms used in the paper also involves data structures (cs.DS) and logic (cs.LO). Additionally, the comparison of achieving arc-consistency on CSPs and unit propagation on SAT problems relates to computational complexity (cs.CC) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
