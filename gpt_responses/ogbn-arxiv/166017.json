This involves training the DNN to have taboo behaviors that are triggered by adversarial samples, which can be detected. This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer security (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the use of taboos to encode and hide information, which relates to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the suitability of this defense mechanism for IoT devices, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
