The paper also uses techniques from discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and analyzes the structure of the point sets using tools from combinatorics (cs.DS, cs.GT). Finally, the paper presents algorithmic results and uses dynamic programming, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
