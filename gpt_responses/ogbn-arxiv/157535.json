This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also discusses the performance of message passing algorithms such as approximate message passing (AMP) and group LASSO, which are commonly used in machine learning and signal processing applications. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG), Signal Processing (cs.SP), and Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-categories. Finally, the paper presents theoretical results on the performance of these algorithms in the strong undersampling regime, which is a topic of interest in the Statistical Inference (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
