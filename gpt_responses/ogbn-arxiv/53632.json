The paper proposes a neural network-based approach for deblurring, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions large-scale datasets, which could indicate that it belongs to the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new network structure, which could suggest that it belongs to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
