This could be of interest to researchers working on systems and control. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper involves modeling and analyzing large datasets, which could be of interest to researchers working on data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
