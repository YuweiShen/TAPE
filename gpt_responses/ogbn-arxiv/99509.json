Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-category of Computation and Language (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper involves the development of tools to summarize and identify arguments, which could fall under the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Information Retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also deals with identifying similar arguments across multiple discussions, which could fall under the sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper involves the use of machine learning techniques to predict argument facet similarity, which could fall under the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
