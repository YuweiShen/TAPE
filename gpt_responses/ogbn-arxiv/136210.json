The use of beamforming and massive MIMO also involves system-level simulations and optimization, which are relevant to the sub-categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper mentions the spatial distribution of users, which could potentially involve natural language processing and text analysis (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
