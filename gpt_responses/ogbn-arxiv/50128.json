This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the use of FCN models and machine learning techniques such as training classifiers and predicting centroids of characters suggest that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also deals with text detection and recognition, which suggests that it may belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) and computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
