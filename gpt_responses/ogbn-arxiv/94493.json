It could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as summarization is a key component of information retrieval systems. Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of existing evaluation measures and proposes improvements, which could fall under the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the use of n-gram overlap and synonymous concepts suggests a potential connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
