The paper also presents simulations to compare different methods for regaining spectral efficiency, which involves information theory (cs.IT) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of component nonlinearities, which is related to optimization and control (cs.OH)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
