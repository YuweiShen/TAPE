The use of frames for signal representation is related to information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SP). The framework also involves machine learning techniques, such as dictionary learning and feature extraction, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses connections with deep convolutional networks, which are commonly used in computer vision and signal processing, and may be relevant to the sub-field of shift-invariant systems (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
