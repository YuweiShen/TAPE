The paper also introduces a new module for capturing global contextual information, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of dilated/atrous convolution and multi-scale features is also related to neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper also explores the use of the proposed module for improving feature representation in image classification, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
