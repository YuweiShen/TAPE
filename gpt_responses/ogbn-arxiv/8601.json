The use of noise uncertainty in evaluating covertness also involves signal processing (cs.MM) and networking (cs.NI) techniques. Additionally, the development of new metrics for measuring covertness can be seen as a contribution to the field of social and information sciences (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
