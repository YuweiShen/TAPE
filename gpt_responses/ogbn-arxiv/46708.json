The paper also introduces a new concept of non-deterministic policies, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). The experiment with human subjects also suggests a connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
