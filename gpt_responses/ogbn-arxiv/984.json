The proposed method uses deep convolutional networks, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of synthetic data to improve the performance of the model, which is relevant to graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO) communities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
