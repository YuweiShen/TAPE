The paper also mentions the use of machine learning (cs.MM) and graphics (cs.GR) techniques to address these challenges. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential applications of omnidirectional video in robotics (cs.RO) and the need for optimization and efficiency in processing large amounts of data, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
