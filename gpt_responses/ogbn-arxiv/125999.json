The paper proposes a framework to index neurons based on their selectivity to specific properties, which is related to neural network interpretability (cs.NE) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the classification of neurons based on their selectivity, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL) where similar techniques are used for feature selection and classification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
