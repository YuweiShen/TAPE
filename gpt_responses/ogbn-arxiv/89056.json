The proposed framework, SimDoc, uses topic modeling and sequence alignment algorithms to estimate semantic similarity between documents. This makes it relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including computational linguistics (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
