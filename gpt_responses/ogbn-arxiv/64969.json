The algorithmic techniques used in the paper are based on micro-macro decomposition and bipartition compatibility criteria. These techniques are commonly used in computational geometry (cs.CG), data structures (cs.DS), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also involves analyzing the running time of the algorithm, which falls under the category of theoretical computer science (cs.THE). Finally, the problem of tree consensus involves making decisions based on multiple inputs, which is related to game theory (cs.GT) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
