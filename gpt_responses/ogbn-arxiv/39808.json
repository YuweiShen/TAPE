Specifically, the paper proposes a new framework for mitigating model bias using SHAP values and an adversarial surrogate model. This work is likely to be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning) as the primary focus is on developing a new framework for machine learning models. Additionally, the paper also touches upon fairness, which is a topic that falls under several subfields of computer science. Therefore, it is also likely to be classified under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CY (Computers and Society), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
