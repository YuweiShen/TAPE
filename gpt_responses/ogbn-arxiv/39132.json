Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as they are also related to deep learning. The paper also deals with spatial information, which suggests that it could belong to cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as they are related to spatial graphs and networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
