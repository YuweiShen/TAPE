The paper also mentions the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to categorize queries, which falls under computational linguistics (CL). The experiments involve large-scale datasets, which could be considered as multimedia (MM) research. Finally, the paper proposes a simple method for text-to-image retrieval, which could be seen as a machine learning (LG) approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
