Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the algorithm is designed to optimize search agents' position during both the exploration and exploitation phases, which suggests that it could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper applies the algorithm to real-world applications, indicating that it could also belong to the Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
