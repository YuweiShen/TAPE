The use of flow computations and conductance measures also suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The mention of \"learning applications\" in the abstract further supports the possibility of the paper falling under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
