This involves training models on low fidelity simulations and then partially retraining them to solve related tasks with limited data. This technique falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), control systems (cs.SY), and programming languages (cs.PL) due to the use of deep neural networks and the creation of models for predicting optimal implosion designs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
