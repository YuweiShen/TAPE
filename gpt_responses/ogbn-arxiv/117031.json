The paper focuses on the exploitation of speculative execution side-channel vulnerabilities to subvert the confidentiality of SGX enclaves. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). \n\nAdditionally, the paper also discusses the automation of the search for vulnerable code patterns in enclave binaries using symbolic execution, which falls under the sub-category of cs.SE (Software Engineering). \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of seal keys and attestation keys, which are related to the sub-category of cs.AR (Architecture). \n\nFurthermore, the paper discusses the evaluation of Intel's existing countermeasures against the attacks, which falls under the sub-category of cs.PL (Programming Languages). \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the impact of the vulnerability on micro-architecture processors, which falls under the sub-category of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
