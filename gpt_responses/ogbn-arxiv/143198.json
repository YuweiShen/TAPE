The paper also uses image frames from a front-facing camera as sensory input, which suggests that it may also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with autonomous driving, which is a common application of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper proposes a query-efficient algorithm, which suggests that it may also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
