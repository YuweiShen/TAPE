The application of this methodology is specifically studied in the context of value function estimation in reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning) followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also touches upon control systems (cs.SY) and neural networks (cs.NE) in the context of reinforcement learning, making these sub-categories also likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
