The paper also proposes the use of multiple shooting, which is a numerical method commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG), and the paper applies the method to neural network parameter estimation (cs.NE) and nonlinear systems with chaotic or unstable behavior (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the smoothness of the objective function, which is a topic in optimization (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
