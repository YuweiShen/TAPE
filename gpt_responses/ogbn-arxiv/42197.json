It also involves natural language processing techniques to learn word embeddings. Additionally, it could also belong to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category as it involves text processing and semantic analysis. The paper also uses machine learning techniques such as neural networks, which makes it relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
