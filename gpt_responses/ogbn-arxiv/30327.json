The paper also mentions applications to software analysis, which suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and programming languages (cs.PL). Additionally, the paper discusses implementation and experimentation with a theorem prover, which suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE) and machine learning (cs.LG) for optimizing the performance of the prover."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
