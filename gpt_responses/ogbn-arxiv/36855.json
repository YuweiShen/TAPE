Specifically, the paper focuses on goal-based multi-task RL, which is a subfield of RL. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely category. The paper also introduces a novel topological landmark covering, which involves constructing a set of landmark states in a fully self-supervised manner. This could potentially fall under computer vision (cs.CV) or robotics (cs.RO) categories. Additionally, the paper discusses using the landmark-centric value functions as features, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper introduces a learned reward function, which could fall under systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
