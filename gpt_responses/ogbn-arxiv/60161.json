It also proposes a method for part localization, which is a common task in computer vision. The paper also involves learning a graphical model in an unsupervised manner, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with object recognition and understanding, which are common topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories.
