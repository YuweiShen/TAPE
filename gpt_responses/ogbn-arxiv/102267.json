The paper also presents empirical experiments on ImageNet and Word Embeddings, which suggests that the paper may belong to the computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of a pre-computed Maximum Inner Product Search data structure suggests that the paper may also belong to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the focus on learning in log-linear models suggests that the paper may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
