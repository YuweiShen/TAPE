The framework can accommodate different types of measurements, including range-based measurements, which are commonly used in localization (cs.CV). The paper also discusses trajectory smoothness constraints, which are often used in optimization-based approaches to localization (cs.LG). The proposed algorithm involves optimization, which is a common technique in control systems (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
