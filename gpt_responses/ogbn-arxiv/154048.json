The use of reinforcement learning (RL) to formulate the task of dialog-based interactive image retrieval also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the RL sub-category (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves the use of a user simulator, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research.
