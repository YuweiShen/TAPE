The paper also mentions recent theoretical understanding on generalizability, expressivity, and optimization landscape of neural networks, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of mathematical frameworks and combinatorial convolution frames suggests that it may also belong to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. The paper also discusses the importance of skipped connections, which suggests that it may belong to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the expressibility of the architecture, which suggests that it may also belong to the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
