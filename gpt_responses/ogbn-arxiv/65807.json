The paper proposes a method for determining the contribution of individual parameters in an ANN to catastrophic forgetting, which falls under the category of machine learning and neural networks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of ANNs in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL), which are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
