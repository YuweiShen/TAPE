The paper focuses on the scalability and accuracy of the proposed solution, which is relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The solution also involves maintaining and updating data in storage systems (cs.DB) and dealing with network partitions and failures (cs.OS). Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency of the proposed solution, which is relevant to networked information systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
