This involves processing a large amount of data produced by diverse systems, which are mostly in textual form. The paper proposes a system that uses a spiral visualization to detect suspicious events that occur between a pair of entities and periodic activity. This system is equipped with several different visualizations and mechanisms to meet the requirements of an internal fraud detection system. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), cs.DB (Databases), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
