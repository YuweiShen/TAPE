The use of multiple pose-specific models also suggests a potential overlap with machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of 3D rendering, which could potentially fall under multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, since the paper deals with security-related applications such as identification and verification, it could also be relevant to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
