The consideration of discrete-time channels and full-scattering vector channels suggests a focus on networking and communication (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The mention of M-FSK modulation and QPSK suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
