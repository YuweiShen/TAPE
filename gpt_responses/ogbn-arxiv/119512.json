This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and networked systems (cs.NI). The development of a novel V2I cybersecurity architecture also involves software engineering (cs.SE) and system design (cs.SY). Additionally, the use of machine learning algorithms for detecting cyberattacks suggests a possible connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
