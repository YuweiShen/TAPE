The use of algebraic geometry in the paper suggests that it may also fall under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper deals with network interference (cs.NI) and multiple antennas (cs.MM), which are both relevant sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with symmetric square cases, which may fall under the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
