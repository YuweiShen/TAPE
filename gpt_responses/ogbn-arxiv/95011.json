The paper also mentions the use of attention-based models, which is a popular technique in computer vision research. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a recurrent neural network (RNN), which is commonly used in computer vision tasks. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as it deals with active vision, which is a key component of robotics. The paper proposes a method for selecting views to attend in order to achieve the vision task, which is a common problem in robotics. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it proposes a novel method for active object recognition using attention mechanism and a recurrent 3D attentional network. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to store and update an internal representation. \n\nFinally, the paper may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category as it uses a differentiable 3D spatial transformer network for training with backpropagation, which is a common technique in neural network research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
