This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) and networking (cs.NI), as well as distributed computing (cs.DC) and machine learning (cs.LG) since the authors propose a steepest descent algorithm to solve the problem. The paper also discusses fairness in the distribution of communication load, which is a topic in social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
