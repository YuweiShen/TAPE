The use of a GAN-style discriminator as a regularizer also suggests a connection to generative models (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet datasets, which are commonly used in computer vision research. Finally, the paper discusses the parameter averaging method for deep net training, which is a topic in natural language processing (cs.CL) as well as machine learning more broadly."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
