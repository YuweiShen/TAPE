The proposed algorithm is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which is a popular optimization technique in information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.MA). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of consensus algorithms, which are commonly used in distributed artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
