This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a method for building topic spaces from summarized documents, which involves natural language processing techniques such as text summarization (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques to process big data, which falls under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.DL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IR and cs.CL, followed by cs.LG, cs.DL, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
