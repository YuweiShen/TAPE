This is a core topic in information theory. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the design of systematic codes that can be decoded efficiently, which is a key concern in data structures and algorithms. \n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper mentions distributed storage applications and seeks to design codes that are suitable for such applications. This makes it relevant to distributed computing. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper mentions multisource multicast network error correction, which is a problem that arises in social and information networks. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with error correction in networks, which is a topic that falls under networking and internet architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
