The proposed approach involves learning shared parameters across multiple datasets, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of non-shared portions of the network to handle dataset-specific characteristics, which is a common approach in neural network engineering (cs.NE).
