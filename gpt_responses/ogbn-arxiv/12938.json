The approach combines reinforcement learning and deep content embedding to automatically discover useful paths for pairs of nodes under both structural and content information. This work involves machine learning, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, and database systems, which are all covered by the above-mentioned sub-categories. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DB (Database Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
