The examples given in the abstract, such as Facebook friendship suggestions and crime networks, also fall under this category. \n\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an active learning method for link prediction, which involves selecting the most informative node pairs to query. This is a machine learning problem, and the paper uses network embedding algorithms to learn representations of nodes in the network. \n\n3. cs.SOC (Computational Social Science): The paper's focus on link prediction in social networks, as well as its use of real-world data, makes it relevant to this sub-category. \n\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper's use of network embedding algorithms to learn representations of nodes in the network is similar to techniques used in information retrieval, such as latent semantic analysis. \n\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper's use of active learning heuristics to select the most informative node pairs to query is a problem in data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
