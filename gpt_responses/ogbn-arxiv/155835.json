The use of convolutional codes is a specific coding technique that is commonly used in communication networks (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the advantages of using convolutional codes in terms of field size and decoding technique, which are topics that fall under the categories of distributed systems (cs.DS) and computer communications (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
