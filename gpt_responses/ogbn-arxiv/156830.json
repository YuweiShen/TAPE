The use of learning-based methods also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) sub-categories. The aggregation of data from different camera sensors and diverse scene content could also suggest that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of color temperature grouping could suggest that it could belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
