This involves image analysis and classification, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The proposed method also involves attention mechanisms and learning patch characteristics, which are common in natural language processing (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories.
