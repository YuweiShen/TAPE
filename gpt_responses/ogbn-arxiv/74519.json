The focus on interactive support for effective and timely decision making by humans suggests a human-computer interaction (cs.HC) component. The use of value of an alert to avoid operator overload suggests a machine learning (cs.MA) or optimization (cs.SY) component. Overall, the paper covers a broad range of topics that could fit into multiple sub-categories, but these five are the most likely based on the content of the abstract."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
