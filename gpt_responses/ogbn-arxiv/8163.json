This involves the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to transform a single still image to a dense depth map. The paper also discusses the fusion of stereo and mono estimates using a novel fusion method. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by robotics (cs.RO), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CVPR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
