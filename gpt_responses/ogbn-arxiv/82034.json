The paper also specifically focuses on extending the use of these networks to hypercomplex-valued data, which is a relatively niche area of research. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SI (Signal Processing), and cs.CV (Computer Vision), as these are all related to the topics discussed in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
