This involves using a graph embedding method to obtain a point-cloud representation of the graph, which makes the neural network aware of the differences between the nodes and their locations in the graph. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
