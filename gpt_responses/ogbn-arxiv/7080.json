Additionally, the paper discusses the use of wireless communication channels for transmitting gradient estimates, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.IT (Information Theory) category. The paper also discusses the use of multiple wireless devices for collaborative ML, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) category. The paper also discusses the use of distributed stochastic gradient descent (DSGD) algorithms, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of sparsity and projection techniques for compressing gradient estimates, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.MM (Multimedia) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
