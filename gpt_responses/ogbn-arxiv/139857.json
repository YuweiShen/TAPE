The paper proposes a new method for learning the structure of the output space in language generation tasks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related topics. \n\nThe paper also proposes a deep residual output mapping with dropout, which is a technique commonly used in deep learning and neural networks. This suggests that the paper could also be relevant to other sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). \n\nFinally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on three language generation tasks, which could also make it relevant to sub-categories such as cs.CV (Computer Vision) if the tasks involve image captioning or other visual language tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
