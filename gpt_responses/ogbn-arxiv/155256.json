This problem is closely related to graph drawing and crossing number problems, which are typically studied in the areas of computational geometry, graph theory, and combinatorics. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). Additionally, the paper introduces new tools and techniques for solving the problem, which could be of interest to researchers in the areas of cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
