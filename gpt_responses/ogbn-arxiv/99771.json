This involves combining a modest number of human similarity assessments to infer a pairwise similarity function between the objects. The paper also discusses how each assessor's tastes vary, affecting their perception of similarity. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including Information Retrieval (cs.IR) as it deals with similarity between objects, Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) as it involves human perception, Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) as it deals with natural language processing for similarity assessments, Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it involves learning from human assessments, and Computer Vision (cs.CV) as it deals with similarity between visual objects such as movies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
