The paper discusses various existing approaches and their limitations. The proposed framework is very simple and can be combined with most multi-task learning models. The paper includes empirical studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), computation and language (cs.CL), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
