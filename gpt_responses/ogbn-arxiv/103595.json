The method aims to personalize the intervention by grouping users based on their trajectory information similarity and learning a shared RL policy for each group. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new reinforcement learning method for mHealth, which involves training an agent to interact with an environment and learn from feedback. Therefore, it is highly likely to belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper focuses on the impact of mobile health technologies on people's health, which is a social and ethical issue. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper deals with the design and evaluation of a personalized mHealth intervention, which involves understanding users' needs and preferences. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new method for learning personalized RL policies for mHealth, which involves using machine learning techniques. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with the clustering of users based on their trajectory information similarity, which involves analyzing social and information networks.
