The paper also mentions the challenges of dealing with large and incomplete knowledge graphs, which is a common problem in database systems (cs.DB). The evaluation of rule learning systems involves generating and testing datasets, which is a task that can be approached using natural language processing techniques (cs.CL). Finally, the paper mentions the complexity of rule formulation, which is a problem that can be addressed using software engineering principles (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
