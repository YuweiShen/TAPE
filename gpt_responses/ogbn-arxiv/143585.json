The system uses image processing techniques to identify and extract the precise contour of the FAZ. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by medical imaging (cs.MED) and information retrieval (cs.IR) since the paper deals with the analysis of retinal microcirculation and the extraction of biomedical parameters. Multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) are also possible sub-categories since the paper proposes a computer-aided diagnosis framework that eases the doctor's work and increases their productivity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
