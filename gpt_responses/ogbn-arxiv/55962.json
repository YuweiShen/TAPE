Therefore, cs.RF is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of signal processing techniques for high range resolution (HRR) profiling and velocity compensation, which falls under the categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and information theory (cs.IT). The investigation of fundamental limits also involves system analysis and control (cs.SY) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) to some extent."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
