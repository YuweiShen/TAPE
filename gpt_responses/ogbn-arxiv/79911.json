This topic falls under the category of Emerging Technologies (cs.ET) as it deals with the development of new technologies for healthcare applications. The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) as it discusses the trade-offs between power consumption and data rate. Additionally, the paper involves the design of analog and radio frequency (RF) circuits (cs.AR) and the use of semiconductor technology (cs.MS). Finally, the paper involves the use of machine learning algorithms for optimizing the design (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
