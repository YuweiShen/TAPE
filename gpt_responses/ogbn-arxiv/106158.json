The paper also makes use of social network structure, which falls under the subfield of social computing, making cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SOC (Social and Information Networks) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also mentions the use of neural structured prediction models, which falls under the subfield of machine learning, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with information retrieval (IR) as it involves linking mentions to entries in a knowledge base, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
