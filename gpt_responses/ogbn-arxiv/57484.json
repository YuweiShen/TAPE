The paper also focuses on optimizing geometry and appearance, which falls under computer graphics (cs.GR) and computational geometry (cs.CG). The use of subvolumes and spherical harmonics for lighting estimation suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
