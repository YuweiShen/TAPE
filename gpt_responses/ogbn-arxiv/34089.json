The use of a nonlinear neighbor-based coordination rule suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The study of set tracking and stability is a common theme in robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), which are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the use of mathematical analysis and optimization techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
