The proposed NOMA schemes involve the use of algebraic lattices, which is a topic related to algebraic geometry (cs.AG) and number theory (cs.NT). The paper also discusses the minimum product distances of the proposed schemes, which is a topic related to coding theory (cs.SY). The extension of the proposed design to the multi-antenna case involves the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which is a topic related to signal processing (cs.SP) and graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
