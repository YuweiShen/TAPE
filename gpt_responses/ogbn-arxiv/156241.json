The focus on dynamic topology and the use of RLNC for broadcast dissemination suggest a connection to networked systems (cs.NI) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The use of probability mass functions and geometric random variables also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
