The paper also uses machine learning techniques such as the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm to identify salient features of SQL queries, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also addresses security auditing, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR). The visualization techniques and interactive algorithm presented in the paper are relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC).
