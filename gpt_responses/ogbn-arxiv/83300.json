The use of temporal logic objectives and the extension to hyper-temporal logics suggest that the paper may belong to the sub-category of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). However, the focus on robotics planning and the evaluation on case studies suggest that it may also belong to the sub-category of Robotics (cs.RO) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The use of symbolic approaches for synthesizing planning strategies suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of Programming Languages (cs.PL) or Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
