This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) category, as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. The paper also discusses the use of different datasets for pretraining models, which could fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) category. Finally, the paper proposes an ensemble of different CNN models, which could fall under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
