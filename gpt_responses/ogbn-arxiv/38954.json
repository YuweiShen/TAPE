The use of non-homogeneous waterfilling and stream control also suggests a focus on signal processing and communication theory (cs.MM). The paper also proposes fast-converging coordination algorithms, which may fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the relevance of the findings to 5G New Radio suggests a possible connection to computer communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
