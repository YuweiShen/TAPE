Additionally, the paper also involves Computer Vision (cs.CV) as it applies CNNs to medical image classification tasks. The paper also involves Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a new FHE compact packing scheme that is tightly integrated with CNN functions. Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) is also a likely category as the paper deals with the application of deep learning techniques to medical imaging. Finally, Cybersecurity (cs.CY) is also a possible category as the paper deals with secure deep learning inference in clinical imaging."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
