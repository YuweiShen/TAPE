The proposed framework is evaluated on different sizes of graphs and various GNNs (GCN & GAT). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
