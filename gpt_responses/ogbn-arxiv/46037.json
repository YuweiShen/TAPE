The paper also discusses different semantics for defaults, which is a topic that falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper uses mathematical concepts and formulas, which suggests that it could also be classified under the categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
