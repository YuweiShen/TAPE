The proposed approach is specifically designed for portrait images, which suggests that it may also fall under the sub-category of graphics (cs.GR). The use of a mobile device for real-time processing suggests that it may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the use of deep learning in the proposed approach suggests that it may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
