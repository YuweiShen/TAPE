The paper also discusses the use of multiple antennas for communication, which falls under the sub-category of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper analyzes the Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) region of the Broadcast Channel (BC), which is a topic related to Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Communication (cs.COMM). Finally, the paper considers a setting in which multiple transmitters jointly serve multiple users, which is a topic related to Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
