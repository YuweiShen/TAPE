The paper presents a new algorithm for the problem and develops a kernelization technique to reduce the size of the input graph. These topics are typically studied in the sub-categories of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
