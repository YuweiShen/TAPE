The paper specifically focuses on extending the LIO language, which is a programming language for IFC that uses floating labels (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the subtleties of adding flow-sensitive constructs to a dynamic IFC system, which is a topic in logic and verification (cs.LO). The paper presents a concurrent version of the extended LIO language, which is a topic in software engineering (cs.SE) and systems and control (cs.SY). Overall, the paper covers a range of topics that could fit into multiple sub-categories, but the most likely ones are cs.CR, cs.PL, cs.LO, cs.SE, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
