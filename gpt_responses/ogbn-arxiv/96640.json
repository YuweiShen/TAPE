This falls under the purview of information theory. \n2. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper proposes a joint design of the communication transmit covariance matrix and the MIMO-MC radar sampling scheme to achieve further EIP reduction. This involves signal processing techniques. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses spectrum sharing between radar and communication systems, which involves networking and internet architecture aspects. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of MIMO-MC radars for spectrum sharing, which can be considered a multimedia application. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a joint design of the communication transmit covariance matrix and the MIMO-MC radar sampling scheme, which can be viewed as a control problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
