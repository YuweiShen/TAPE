The paper presents several improvements on the known hardness of the problem, including deterministic and randomized reductions from other well-known problems. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to several sub-categories, including data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), information theory (cs.IT), computational geometry (cs.CG), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
