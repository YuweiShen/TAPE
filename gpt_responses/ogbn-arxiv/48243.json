Additionally, the paper mentions the use of surface normal priors derived from Manhattan-world assumptions, which is a common technique in computer vision. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it deals with 3D scene reconstruction, which is a common problem in computer graphics. \n\nThe Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category is also a possibility as stereo matching is an important problem in robotics for tasks such as obstacle avoidance and localization. \n\nThe Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category is a possibility as stereo matching is a fundamental problem in computer vision, which is a subfield of AI. \n\nFinally, the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category is a possibility as the paper mentions the use of priors, which can be seen as a form of regularization, a common technique in machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
