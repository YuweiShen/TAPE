The paper also uses rate-distortion theory, which is a subfield of information theory. The paper may also be relevant to the subfield of coding theory (cs.CC) since it deals with compression. The paper also uses mathematical tools such as Gaussian approximation, which may be relevant to the subfield of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper may be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) since variable-length compression is commonly used in multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
