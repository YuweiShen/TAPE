Specifically, the paper focuses on discourse-based sentence fusion, which involves identifying and incorporating various discourse phenomena in the fused text. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related tasks. \n\nThe paper also proposes a method for automatically generating fusion examples from raw text, which involves using neural models and machine learning techniques. This suggests that the paper may also belong to sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nAdditionally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach using both automatic and human evaluation, which involves comparing the generated text with the original text and assessing the quality of the fusion. This suggests that the paper may also belong to sub-categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which deal with evaluation and assessment of models and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
