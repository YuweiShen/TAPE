This paper uses the term in a similar way, to refer to the group of automorphisms that leave a rational function invariant. \n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper deals with algorithms for computing fixed fields and fixing groups, which are central concepts in algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory. Symbolic computation is a subfield of computer science that deals with algorithms for manipulating mathematical expressions, and is closely related to these areas. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper describes polynomial time algorithms for computing fixed fields and fixing groups, which are fundamental problems in algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory. These algorithms likely involve sophisticated data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper deals with the Galois group of a transcendental field extension, which is a central concept in algebraic geometry. Computational geometry is a subfield of computer science that deals with algorithms for solving geometric problems, and is closely related to algebraic geometry. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper deals with the Galois group of a transcendental field extension, which is a central concept in model theory and mathematical logic.
