The paper also involves the study of the repair properties of these codes, which can be seen as a problem in distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper proposes a generic transformation that can be applied to existing codes, which involves some algorithmic aspects (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the properties of the resultant codes, such as their sub-packetization and access properties, which can be seen as a problem in systems and networking (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the implications of the proposed transformation on the design of codes, which can be seen as a problem in complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
