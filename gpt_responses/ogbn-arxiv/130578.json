The use of semantic data and registration algorithms also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and learning (cs.LG). Finally, the problem of enhancing dark facial images for different identities, expressions, and poses may involve graphics (cs.GR) techniques such as image warping and morphing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
