This is a core topic in information theory.\n2. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper applies a large-deviations approach from random matrix theory to obtain the outage capacity for Haar matrices. This involves numerical analysis techniques.\n3. cs.PH (Physics): The Coulomb gas method for the eigenvalues of a matrix developed in statistical physics is used in the paper. This makes it relevant to the physics sub-category.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although the paper is not directly related to social networks, the concept of multiple channels and modes can be related to network communication. Hence, it could be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with increasing information throughput in fiber optical communications, which is relevant to multimedia applications. Hence, it could be relevant to the sub-category of multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
