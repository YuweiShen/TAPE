The paper also mentions the use of an end-to-end deep learning framework, which suggests that the paper may fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of adaptive beamforming techniques, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper mentions the use of RF data to generate ultrasound images, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
