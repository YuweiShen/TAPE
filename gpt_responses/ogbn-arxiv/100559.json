The approach is evaluated on high-dimensional biomedical datasets, which suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and data science (cs.DS). Additionally, the use of classifiers and optimization techniques may also indicate a connection to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
