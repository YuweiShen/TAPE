The approach proposed in the paper involves the use of reachability analysis, which is a common technique in control theory and system dynamics (cs.SY). The paper also addresses the problem of sensing and predicting the environment, which is a key aspect of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method involves real-time trajectory planning and collision checking, which are common topics in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
