The paper proposes a novel scalable PU learning algorithm that is theoretically proven to provide the optimal solution, while showing superior computational and memory performance. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
