This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel way to achieve this by conducting patch ranking, which involves reordering the feature maps before feeding them into the next layer. This approach involves modifying the architecture of the CNN, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of data augmentation and the capacity of the model, which are relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach on benchmark tasks, which falls under the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
