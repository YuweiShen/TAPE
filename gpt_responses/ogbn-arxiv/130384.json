This makes it relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art object detectors, which makes it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. Finally, the paper was presented at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), which makes it relevant to the cs.CVPR sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
