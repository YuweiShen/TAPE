The proposed method involves the fusion and propagation of manifold structures, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The experiments involve datasets of images and their corresponding semantic information, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
