This topic falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. The paper also introduces heuristics for pruning convolutional edges, which involves optimization techniques and machine learning algorithms, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper presents an end-to-end framework for fine-tuning the pruned network, which involves designing a triplet loss function, making it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
