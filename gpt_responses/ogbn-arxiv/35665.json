The paper also discusses the interpretation of pointing actions, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The proposed interpretive principles for robotic communication involve reasoning and decision-making, which are key components of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the evaluation of the principles involves analyzing animations, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
