The paper also proposes new primitives for efficient and correct SM over RDMA, which is a key aspect of distributed computing. \n\n2. cs.DB (Databases): The paper discusses the use of synchronous mirroring for building highly-available and fault-tolerant enterprise storage systems, which is a common use case for databases. The paper also evaluates the performance implications of RDMA-based SM using a modified version of the WHISPER benchmark suite, which includes a set of common cloud applications. \n\n3. cs.OS (Operating Systems): The paper discusses the use of persistent memory and ultra-low-latency network technologies, which are key components of modern operating systems. The paper also proposes new primitives for efficient and correct SM over RDMA, which could be integrated into operating systems to improve the performance and reliability of distributed storage systems. \n\n4. cs.AR (Architecture): The paper discusses the performance implications of RDMA-based SM on emerging persistent memory and ultra-low-latency network technologies, which are key components of modern computer architectures. The paper also proposes new primitives for efficient and correct SM over RDMA, which could be integrated into future computer architectures to improve the performance and reliability of"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
