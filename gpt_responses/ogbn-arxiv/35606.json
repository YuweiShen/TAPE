Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the development of deep learning-based solutions, which falls under the category of machine learning (ML) and specifically deep learning (DL), making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DL (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the challenges of validation and integration of computational systems in clinical workflow, which involves information retrieval (IR) and multimedia (MM) aspects, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.MM (Multimedia) possible sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
