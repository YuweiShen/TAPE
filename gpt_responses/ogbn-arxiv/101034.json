The paper focuses on the design and performance analysis of the proposed codes, which are based on two-stage polarization. This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT), as well as coding theory (cs.CC) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses implementation issues, which could fall under computer networks and internet architecture (cs.NI) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
