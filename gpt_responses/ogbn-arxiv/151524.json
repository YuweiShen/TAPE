Additionally, the paper also conducts experiments on real-world multi-label image classification problems, which further supports its classification under cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also proposes a general attacking framework targeting multi-label classification problems, which involves the use of deep neural networks, indicating its relevance to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Furthermore, the paper discusses the effectiveness of defensive strategies, which is a topic of interest in the sub-category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper also presents insights into the vulnerability of multi-label deep learning models under diverse targeted attacking strategies, which is relevant to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
