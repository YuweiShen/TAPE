This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of unsupervised learning, which is a popular topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The application of the proposed models in autonomous driving scenarios suggests a possible connection to robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of multiple losses in the proposed models suggests a possible connection to neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
