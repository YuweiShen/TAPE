Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes heuristics for solving the problem, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of minimum-link paths in simple polygons suggests the relevance of cs.GR (Computer Graphics) as well. Finally, the practical application of the algorithms in road networks implies the relevance of cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
