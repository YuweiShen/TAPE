The paper also discusses the implications of recently enacted legislation on personal data, which is related to computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The proposed method of linear filtration involves manipulating the weights of a logit-based classifier, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the experiments involve evaluating the performance of the proposed method on various datasets, which is a common practice in data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
