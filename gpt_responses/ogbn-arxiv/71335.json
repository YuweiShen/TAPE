The proposed method utilizes fully convolutional networks, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection, indicating a strong connection to the cs.CV sub-category. The use of privileged information and deep learning techniques also suggests a connection to the cs.LG and cs.AI sub-categories. Additionally, the application of the proposed method to multi-object recognition and automatic image tagging aligns with the cs.MM sub-category. Finally, the use of structured correlations among instances suggests a connection to the cs.NE sub-category, which deals with neural networks and their applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
