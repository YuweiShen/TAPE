It also involves coding theory, specifically the dimension of products of codes, which falls under information theory (cs.IT) and discrete mathematics (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the Frobenius, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper uses probabilistic arguments, which is a common approach in theoretical computer science (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
