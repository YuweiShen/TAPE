Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the efficiency and reliability of the proposed scheme, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.IT (Information Theory). The proposed scheme also involves reducing memory consumption and processing complexity, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
