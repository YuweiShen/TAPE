Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also analyzes the effects of retraining on feedforward deep neural networks (FFDNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the performance gap between floating-point and retrain-based ternary weight neural networks, which could place it in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
