The paper also proposes a clone-based analysis methodology to accelerate the reverse engineering process, which falls under the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The use of advanced anti-reverse engineering techniques in the Citadel malware also suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The joint operation conducted by FBI and Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit to take down Citadel command-and-control servers involves distributed computing (cs.DC) techniques. Finally, the financial information targeted by the Citadel malware falls under the network and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
