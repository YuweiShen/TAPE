The use of nonnegativity certificates also suggests a connection to semidefinite programming and convex optimization (cs.SC). Additionally, the paper involves the analysis of polynomials, which is a topic in algebraic geometry and combinatorics (cs.LO, cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
