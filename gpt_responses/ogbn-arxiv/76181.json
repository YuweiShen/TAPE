This involves feature selection and mapping that is pathophysiologically interpretable. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel generative model that uses machine learning techniques to generate virtual patients for pre-procedural planning in complex surgeries.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper uses convolutional neural networks to extract features from medical images and generate virtual patients that are visually authentic.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel AI-based approach to generate virtual patients for pre-procedural planning in complex surgeries.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses generative adversarial networks to generate virtual patients that are visually authentic and pathophysiologically interpretable.\n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper may involve the development of mathematical software for implementing the proposed generative model."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
