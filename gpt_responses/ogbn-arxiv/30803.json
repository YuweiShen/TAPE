The use of Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to obtain semantic information for encoding convolutional features suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of object proposals, which is a common technique in multimedia (cs.MM) and computer vision. Finally, the paper discusses the use of natural language processing techniques to generate object proposals, which suggests a possible connection to computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
