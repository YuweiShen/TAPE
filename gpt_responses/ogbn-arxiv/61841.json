The paper proposes a statistical estimation framework for inferring the expected voting score in an ideal world where all workers label all items. This framework involves using supervised learners to imitate workers and reduce the variance of estimation. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
