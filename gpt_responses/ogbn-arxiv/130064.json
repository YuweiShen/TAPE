This category is the most relevant one for this paper.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): Serverless computing introduces new challenges for software engineering, such as testing, debugging, and deployment. This category is also highly relevant.\n- cs.Distributed (Distributed Computing): Similar to cs.DC, this category covers distributed computing paradigms, including serverless computing.\n- cs.AR (Architecture): Serverless computing has implications for software architecture, such as the use of microservices and event-driven architectures. This category is less likely but still relevant.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): Serverless computing relies on function-as-a-service (FaaS) platforms, which require developers to write functions in specific programming languages. This category is also less likely but still relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
