This involves addressing challenges such as strong affine variations in scale, viewpoint, projection parameters, partial or complete occlusion of objects, and extreme variations in ambient illumination. The proposed method combines low-level local feature descriptors with high-level shape cues to generate a graph-based representation for the disparate image pair, which is modeled as a graph matching problem. The paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category, as it deals with image matching and shape representation. It may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories, as it proposes an end-to-end trainable ConvNet architecture. Additionally, it may belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories, as it deals with image matching in challenging conditions and may have applications in multimedia and robotics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
