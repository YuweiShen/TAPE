The algorithms developed for estimating contact and aerodynamic forces involve modeling and estimation techniques, which are relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of data-driven and physics-based models, which are relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the developed methods could serve as useful estimators for interaction control schemes, which is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
