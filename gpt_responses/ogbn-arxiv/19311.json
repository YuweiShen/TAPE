This involves identifying signals that are hidden within noise, which is a problem in the field of networked systems and communication (cs.NI). The use of neural networks as a general algorithmic framework also falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of coding at the physical layer, which is a topic in cryptography and security (cs.CR) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
