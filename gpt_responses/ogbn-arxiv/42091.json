The specific application mentioned in the abstract is forwarding table optimization in IP routing and software-defined networks, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also presents a deterministic algorithm, which falls under the category of algorithms (cs.AL). The problem of caching with dependencies is also relevant in the context of system integration (cs.SI) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
