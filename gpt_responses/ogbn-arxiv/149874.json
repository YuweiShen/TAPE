The paper also deals with litmus tests, which are commonly used in computer architecture (cs.AR) to test the correctness of memory models. The stability rules mentioned in the paper suggest a focus on distributed systems (cs.DS), and the use of temporal modalities suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
