The use of word embeddings and label propagation also suggests a focus on machine learning and data mining techniques. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and machine learning for language processing. \n\nThe paper also involves social media analysis, which falls under the sub-category cs.SI (Social and Information Networks).
