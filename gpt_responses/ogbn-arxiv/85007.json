The use of character sums suggests a connection to algebraic coding theory (cs.DM). The codes are also quasi-cyclic, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the application to secret sharing schemes suggests a connection to cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
