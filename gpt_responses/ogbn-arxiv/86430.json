The algorithmic techniques used in the paper involve adaptive sampling and edge search, which are common in randomized algorithms and combinatorics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the error probability of the algorithm, which is related to information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper uses lower bounds to show the importance of adaptivity, which is a topic in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
