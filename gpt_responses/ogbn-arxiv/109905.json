This involves using probability optimization aggregates to allow for minimization or maximization of desired criteria under probabilistic environments. This work involves aspects of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in terms of developing a logical framework, machine learning (cs.LG) in terms of optimization, data structures (cs.DS) in terms of representing and manipulating probabilistic data, multi-agent systems (cs.MA) in terms of dealing with stochastic environments, and systems and control (cs.SY) in terms of optimization under uncertainty."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
