This falls under the category of network and information security (cs.CR) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). The use of software-defined radio technology and open-source software also suggests a focus on information theory (cs.IT) and software engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of performance measurement counters and classification methods for effective mitigation, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
