The focus of the paper is on the regularization aspect of self-distillation, which is a common technique used in deep learning to prevent over-fitting. Therefore, it is likely to be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) as well, as these fields heavily rely on regularization techniques. The paper also discusses the use of Hilbert space for modeling the solution space, which is a common technique in neural network theory and optimization, and thus it may be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
