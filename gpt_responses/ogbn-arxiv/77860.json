It also involves information theory (cs.IT) in the form of distributions and their distinguishability. The paper also discusses the structure of functions, which falls under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Finally, the paper touches on cryptography (cs.CR) in the context of random oracles."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
