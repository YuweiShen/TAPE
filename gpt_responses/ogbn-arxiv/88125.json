The proposed method involves the use of constraints on the tubal rank and sparsity of the tensor, which are concepts related to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The algorithm used to solve the proposed model is based on random projections, which is a technique used in multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
