The algorithms are also data-oblivious, meaning they do not perform any data-dependent operations, which is a characteristic of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the relevance of the algorithms to geographic information systems and location-based services, which suggests a connection to databases (cs.DB) and computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper deals with problems related to convex hulls and nearest neighbors, which are classic topics in computational geometry (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
