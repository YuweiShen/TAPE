The use of description logic programs and answer set semantics also suggests a connection to databases (cs.DB) and computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the use of default logic as a foundation for query-based approaches suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
