The analysis of the effects of nonlinearities on channel capacity also involves network infrastructure (cs.NI) and system modeling (cs.SY). Finally, the use of computer simulations to validate the derived expressions suggests that the paper may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
