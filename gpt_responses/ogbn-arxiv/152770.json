The paper specifically focuses on the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) receiver, which is a technique used in signal processing and communication systems, making the sub-categories Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) and Multimedia (cs.MA) also likely. The paper also introduces a mixture-based method for modeling the correlation in interference powers, which could fall under the Game Theory (cs.GT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
