Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves end-to-end text recognition, which falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP), making cs.CL (Computation and Language) another likely category. The proposed method involves deep learning, which is a popular technique in machine learning, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another possible category. The paper also involves information retrieval, as it deals with extracting text from images, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another possible category. Finally, the paper involves experiments on datasets, which involves multimedia analysis, making cs.MM (Multimedia) another possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
