The paper specifically addresses the issue of privilege separation in TEE applications, which involves partitioning an enclave into tagged memory regions and enforcing per-region access rules, indicating a focus on operating systems (cs.OS) and software engineering (cs.SE). The use of Memory Protection Keys (MPK) for memory tagging suggests a potential connection to distributed computing (cs.DC) and architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
