However, based on the abstract, the focus of the study is on measuring the physical distances between co-authoring researchers, which suggests a strong connection to the sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). Additionally, the use of large-scale data analysis and empirical methods suggests a possible connection to sub-categories such as Digital Libraries (cs.DL), Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Cybersecurity (cs.CY), and Information Retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
