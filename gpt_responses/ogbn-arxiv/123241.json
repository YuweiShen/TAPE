The paper also focuses on a classification task using a convolutional neural network, which is a common technique in computer vision, suggesting that cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is another likely category. The paper proposes a method for compressing deep neural networks using information theory, which is a topic in cs.IT (Information Theory).
