It could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it proposes a method to verify safety properties on perception units. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.RO (Robotics) as it mentions a toy example mimicking an autonomous car perceptive unit. It could also be classified under cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it deals with the safety of perception systems. Finally, it could belong to cs.SE (Software Engineering) as it proposes a tool to translate deep learning models into standard logical formulae."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
