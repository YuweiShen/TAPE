Therefore, cs.SC (Symbolic Computation) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the desingularization of Ore operators, which is a topic in control theory and system theory, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) another likely sub-category. The algorithm presented in the paper involves computations with polynomials, which suggests that cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper mentions applications in certifying integer sequences and checking special cases of a conjecture, which suggests that cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
