The use of persistence diagrams also involves discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.GT). The algorithm presented in the paper involves data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) for processing the persistence diagrams. Lastly, the empirical validation of the algorithm involves computational simulations (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
