The paper presents an algorithm for image alignment that iteratively performs incremental gradient descent constrained to the Grassmann manifold of subspaces. This algorithm is designed to simultaneously estimate three components of a decomposition of a collection of images: a low-rank subspace, a sparse part of occlusions and foreground objects, and a transformation such as rotation or translation of the image. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
