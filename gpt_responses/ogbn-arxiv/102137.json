The paper specifically discusses the use of predictive neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also draws inspiration from neuroscience (cs.NE) and discusses the use of internal representations for object recognition (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the application of these networks to estimate the steering angle in a car-mounted camera video, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
