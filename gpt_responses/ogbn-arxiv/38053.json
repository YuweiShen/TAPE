The paper proposes methods for adapting to shifting video content, which is a common problem in computer vision. \n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper proposes a method for retrieving video streams based on semantic relatedness to pre-trained concept classifiers, which is a common technique in information retrieval. The paper also proposes means for evaluating stream retrieval tasks, which is another aspect of information retrieval. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the retrieval of live video streams, which is a problem in multimedia. The paper proposes methods for adapting to shifting video content, which is a common problem in multimedia. \n4. cs.CL (Computational Linguistics): The paper proposes a method for retrieving video streams based on semantic relatedness to pre-trained concept classifiers, which is a common technique in computational linguistics. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes memory pooling and memory welling methods for adapting to shifting video content, which are machine learning techniques. The paper also evaluates the proposed methods using large scale video datasets, which is another aspect of machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
