The approach also involves clustering and agglomerative techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of artificial intelligence techniques to analyze recognition scores (cs.AI). The use of deep networks also involves neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the use of annotations to train object detectors, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
