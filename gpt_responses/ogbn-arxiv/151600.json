The use of machine learning (cs.MS) and computer vision (cs.CV) is also possible for analyzing and detecting defects in the as-manufactured structures. Additionally, the paper mentions the limitations of available 3D printer resolution, which falls under the scope of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
