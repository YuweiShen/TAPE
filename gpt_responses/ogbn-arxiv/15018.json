The focus of the paper is on stereoscopic images, which involves processing two views of an image to ensure consistency, making it relevant to graphics (cs.GR). The paper proposes a novel feature aggregation strategy, which involves combining information from both views, making it relevant to multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also proposes a multi-layer view loss to enforce coordination between the two paths, which involves optimizing the network, making it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
