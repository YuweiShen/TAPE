Therefore, cs.HCI and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with data analysis and visualization, which could fall under cs.DB and cs.IR. Finally, the use of NLP techniques to assist with dataflow diagram construction could also be considered as an application of artificial intelligence (AI), making cs.AI a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
