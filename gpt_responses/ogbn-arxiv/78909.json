The paper also discusses the use of neural models for relation extraction, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The adaptation method proposed in the paper involves adjusting the label distribution, which is a common problem in domain adaptation (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on several benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
