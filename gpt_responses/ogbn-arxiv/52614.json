Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the design and optimization of CNN architectures, which falls under machine learning (ML) and specifically deep learning (DL), making cs.LG and cs.AI likely sub-categories as well. The paper uses a public database for training and evaluation, which is related to multimedia (MM) and potentially computer security and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
