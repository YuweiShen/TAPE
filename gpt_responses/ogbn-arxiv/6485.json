The use of ADMM is a common optimization technique in computer science (cs.CC) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses factor graphs, which are commonly used in machine learning and data science (cs.DS). The application of the decoder to fields of characteristic two suggests a focus on finite fields and algebraic coding theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
