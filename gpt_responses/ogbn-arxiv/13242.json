This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence, specifically in the area of automated reasoning and problem-solving. \n2. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper discusses the decomposition of constraints into simpler ones, which is a common technique in programming languages. Additionally, the use of views as an alternative to auxiliary variables and propagators can be seen as a programming language construct. \n3. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) - Constraint programming is closely related to logic programming, and the paper discusses the use of views as a way to simplify the propagation algorithm for complex constraints. This falls under the scope of logic in computer science. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the use of decomposition and propagation algorithms, which are common topics in data structures and algorithms. Additionally, the use of views as an alternative to auxiliary variables and propagators can be seen as a data structure. \n5. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) - Constraint programming is closely related to discrete mathematics, and the paper discusses the use of views as a way to simplify the propagation algorithm for complex constraints.
