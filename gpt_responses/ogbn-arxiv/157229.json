This falls under the scope of numerical analysis, making cs.NA the most likely sub-category.\n\n2. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The proposed technique can be applied to various partial differential equation systems, which are commonly encountered in computational engineering and science. Therefore, cs.CE is also a likely sub-category.\n\n3. cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper presents a new numerical technique that can be implemented using mathematical software. This makes cs.MS a possible sub-category.\n\n4. cs.SC (Symbolic Computation and Computer Algebra): The paper involves the use of mathematical functions and equations, which can be analyzed symbolically. Therefore, cs.SC is also a possible sub-category.\n\n5. cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The use of meshless and integration-free techniques is a relatively new and emerging area in numerical analysis. Therefore, cs.ET is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
