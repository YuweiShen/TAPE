The study also involves the use of machine learning algorithms to balance the workload between operators, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of trust in the system and in other operators, which is a key aspect of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
