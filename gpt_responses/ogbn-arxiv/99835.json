This involves the use of various data structures and algorithms related to graph theory, making cs.DS a likely sub-category.\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with comparing large-scale networks, which is a key area of research in social and information networks. The paper also provides computational results for real large-scale networks, further supporting this sub-category.\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses the theory of quantum probability to propose a new measurement for comparing large-scale graphs. This involves the use of various concepts from information theory, such as moment matrices and spectral distributions, making cs.IT a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new distance measure for comparing large-scale graphs, which can be seen as a machine learning task. The paper also provides computational results for real large-scale networks, which can be seen as a machine learning application.\n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper provides computational results for real large-scale networks, which involves analyzing the time cost of the proposed distance measure.
