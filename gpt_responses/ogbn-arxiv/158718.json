Additionally, the proposed BoostNet is a deep learning model that uses gradient boosting, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also involves medical imaging (cs.MM) as it deals with fundus images. Finally, the use of deep learning and gradient boosting techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
