The use of different array layouts and search algorithms also involves computational complexity (cs.CC) and possibly machine learning (cs.AI) techniques for optimization. The mention of extensive testing and tuning suggests that the paper may also involve experimental methods (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
