Information theory is concerned with the efficient transmission and processing of information, making this category a likely fit.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): Visible light communication is a type of wireless communication, and this paper specifically addresses the challenges of VLC. Networking and Internet Architecture is a relevant category for this paper.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a system for generating flicker-free codes in VLC, which could fall under the Systems and Control category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): While not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, machine learning techniques could potentially be used in the proposed system for generating flicker-free codes. Therefore, this category is a possibility.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The proposed system involves the use of polar codes, which are a type of error-correcting code. This could potentially fall under the Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
