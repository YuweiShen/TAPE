Additionally, the paper proposes an approach to obtain approximate queries, which involves techniques such as tree transformations and pattern matching, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also evaluates the efficiency of the approximate queries, which can be related to deep learning (cs.DL) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
