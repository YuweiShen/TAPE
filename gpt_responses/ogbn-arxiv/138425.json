Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses neural networks for sentence embeddings and distance-based outlier detection, which falls under the category of machine learning (ML). Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses data collection and mining, which falls under the category of information retrieval (IR). Therefore, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper presents a technique for improving model robustness, which falls under the category of systems and control (SI). Therefore, cs.SI (Systems and Control) is a less likely but still possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
