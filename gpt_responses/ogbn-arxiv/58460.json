This is a common problem in machine learning and statistics, and falls under the category of sparse estimation. The paper proposes two algorithms for solving this problem, one based on block coordinate descent and the other based on Nesterov's first order method. These algorithms are tested on synthetic data as well as real-world data from gene expression and senate voting records. Given the focus on machine learning and statistical modeling, as well as the use of algorithms for optimization, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and stat.ML (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
