The use of visual odometry and factor graph optimization suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The need for reliability in harsh conditions and the inclusion of inertial navigation suggests a focus on control systems (cs.SY). The use of optimization methods also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
