Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves statistical estimators and probability bounds, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper's focus on practical applications and the use of stable distributions could also place it in cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper's use of sample complexity bounds suggests that it could also belong to cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
