The use of maximum weight stable sets on derived graphs is a popular approach in these fields, suggesting that cs.AI and cs.CV are likely categories. The paper also discusses extensions of results for binary pairwise models with submodular cost functions, which are relevant to optimization problems in computer science, indicating that cs.DS and cs.DM are also possible categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
