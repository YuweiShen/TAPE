The model is implemented using technologies such as OAI-ORE Aggregations and OAC Annotations, which are fundamental building blocks of digital libraries.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of a canvas painting paradigm to fulfill complex requirements such as when the full text of a page is known, but only fragments of the physical object remain. This involves information retrieval techniques to match and align fragments of text and images.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper presents instantiations of the model as the input to collection-independent page turning and scholarly presentation interfaces, which require user-friendly and intuitive interfaces for interacting with the digitized manuscripts.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper mentions the use of full-text search and named entity recognition to enable searching and browsing of the digitized manuscripts.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper focuses on the layout-oriented presentation of images of text, which involves multimedia techniques for displaying and manipulating images and text."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
