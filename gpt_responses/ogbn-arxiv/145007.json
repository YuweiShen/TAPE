This falls under the scope of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes LIS as a wireless communication solution that can be deployed on man-made structures such as walls. This involves the use of networking and internet architecture to enable reliable communication. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper analyzes the performance of an LIS system, which involves the control of antenna arrays for wireless communication. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of LIS for wireless communication, which can be used for multimedia applications such as video streaming. \n5. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper may involve the design and implementation of hardware architecture for the antenna arrays used in the LIS system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
