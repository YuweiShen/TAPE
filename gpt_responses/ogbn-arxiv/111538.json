Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the impact of training method and corpus size on the quality of word embeddings, which relates to machine learning and data mining, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) likely sub-categories as well. Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of word embeddings on sentiment analysis tasks, which is a common application of artificial intelligence (AI), making cs.AI a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the impact of corpus size on the quality of word embeddings, which relates to neural networks and deep learning, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
