The paper establishes optimal bounds on the number of nested propagation steps in k-consistency tests, which is a fundamental problem in constraint satisfaction. This work is relevant to several areas of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), computational complexity (cs.CC), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
