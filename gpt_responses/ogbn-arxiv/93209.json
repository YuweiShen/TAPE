This falls under the scope of programming languages research.\n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper focuses on optimizing code for various hardware architectures, including multicores, GPUs, FPGAs, and distributed systems. This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to the hardware architecture sub-category.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper mentions the ability of Tiramisu to generate code for distributed heterogeneous systems, which suggests that it falls under the distributed computing sub-category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the separation of algorithms, schedules, data-layouts, and communication in Tiramisu, which can simplify targeting multiple hardware architectures from the same algorithm. This is a software engineering concern.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with optimizing code for high-performance systems, which can be considered as a systems and control problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
