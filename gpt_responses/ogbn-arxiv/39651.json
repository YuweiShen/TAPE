Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves techniques for mapping and localisation, which falls under cs.RO (Robotics). The paper proposes a novel rotation averaging formulation, which involves optimization and machine learning techniques, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely categories as well. Finally, the paper involves combinatorial optimization and graph theory, which falls under cs.GR (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
