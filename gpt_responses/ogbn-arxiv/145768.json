The use of delta modeling also involves variability modeling, which is a topic in programming languages (cs.PL) and software design (cs.SD). The paper also mentions the implementation of a domain-specific language (DSL) using a DSL development framework, which is related to language generation (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the evaluation of the proposed approach, which involves comparing it with existing methods, which falls under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
