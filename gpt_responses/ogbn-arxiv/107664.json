The added constraint of security against an eavesdropper makes it relevant to the sub-category of cryptography (cs.CR). The problem involves multiple databases and encoding of answer strings, which suggests a connection to distributed systems (cs.DS). The use of codes for encoding the secret key and artificial noise vector also points towards coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper deals with privacy and security constraints, which are relevant to the sub-category of security and privacy (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
