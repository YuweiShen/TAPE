The paper also proposes a novel approach to mitigate forgetting in a continual learning setting, which is a common problem in machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed approach involves attention mechanisms and feature distillation, which are also commonly used in other machine learning tasks such as natural language processing (cs.AI, cs.CL). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on multiple object detection datasets, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
