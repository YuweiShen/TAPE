It also mentions the use of deep learning-type optimization, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm is a numerical optimization method, which is relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper discusses the use of perturbations and noise, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
