It also discusses the effects of imperfect channel state information on MIMO transmissions, which is a topic related to networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper compares the throughput loss of both single-user (SU) and multiuser (MU) MIMO in the broadcast channel, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM) and communication networks (cs.COM). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT, cs.NI, cs.SY, cs.MM, and cs.COM, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
