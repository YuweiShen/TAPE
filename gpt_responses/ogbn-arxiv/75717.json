This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the database (cs.DB) and cybersecurity (cs.CR) sub-categories, as these are areas where traceability and data management are important. The paper also mentions the use of meta-data and description-driven design, which are techniques commonly used in cyberinfrastructure (cs.CY) and software engineering (cs.SE).
