It could also belong to the categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) as word embeddings are often used as input features for machine learning models. Neural Networks (cs.NE) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) are less likely categories, but they could be relevant if the paper discusses the use of word embeddings in image captioning or other visual tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
