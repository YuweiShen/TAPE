The paper also mentions unsupervised training, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of optical flow constraint and testing on real image sequences suggests that it may also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of CNNs suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
