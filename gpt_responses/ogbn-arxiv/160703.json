This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT), as well as networking and communication (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also uses mathematical optimization techniques (cs.MA) and statistical analysis (cs.LG) to derive the optimal policy."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
