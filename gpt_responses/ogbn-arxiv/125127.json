The paper uses techniques from computational geometry and graph theory, which are typically found in cs.CG and cs.DM. The paper also discusses the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, which is a topic in cs.CC and cs.LG. Finally, the paper introduces a framework for proving quadratic-time hardness of similarity measures, which is a topic in cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
