Therefore, cs.CL is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, which are relevant to cs.AI, cs.LG, and cs.NE. Finally, the paper discusses the possibility of using transformers as a \"soft theorem prover,\" which is related to the field of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
