The receiver incorporates sparsity-based parametric channel estimation, which is a technique used in signal processing and machine learning (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the performance of the receiver in terms of bit-error-rate, which is a metric commonly used in networking and information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, which are methods used in computer science and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
