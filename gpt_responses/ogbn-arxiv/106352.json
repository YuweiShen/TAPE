The use of social networking services (SNSs) and human curation also suggests a possible connection to social network analysis (cs.SI) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the proposed method for feature learning based on sparse coding or network fine-tuning could also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
