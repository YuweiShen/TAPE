This problem falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI) sub-categories. The paper also proposes an algorithm for determining a complimentary set of users, which can attain local omniscience without increasing the sum-rate, and this algorithm involves graph theory and combinatorial optimization techniques, which are relevant to the sub-categories of social and information networks (cs.SI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
