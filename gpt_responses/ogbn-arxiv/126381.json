This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of various loss functions and their performance, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of deep learning for remote sensing applications can also be related to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed framework on a dataset can be related to robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
