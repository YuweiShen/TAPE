The use of off-the-shelf pre-trained CNNs also suggests that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The study also involves the use of medial-axis based contour salience methods, which may place it in the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the comparison of CNN performance to human performance suggests that it may also belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
