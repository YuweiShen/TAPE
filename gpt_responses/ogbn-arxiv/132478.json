The features used in the metric include freeze duration statistics, inter-freeze distance statistics, frame difference before and after the freeze, and normal frame difference. These features suggest that the paper could belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM), Computer Vision (cs.CV), Information Theory (cs.IT), Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
