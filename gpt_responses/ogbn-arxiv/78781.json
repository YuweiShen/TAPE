Therefore, the most likely category is cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also introduces a novel approach for learning the optimal value function, which involves weakly supervising a neural net with interval samples obtained from solving mixed-integer programs. This suggests that the paper could also be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with feedback control, which falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper uses a planar humanoid robot model, which could potentially involve computer vision techniques, placing it under cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
