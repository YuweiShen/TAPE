The paper also involves computational complexity analysis and experiments, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The topic of mechanism design is closely related to decision making and optimization, which are also relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
