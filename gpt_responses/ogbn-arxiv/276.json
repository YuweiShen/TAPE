The use of empirical cumulant generating functions and entropy measures also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the extension of the results to compression with side information indicates a possible relevance to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
