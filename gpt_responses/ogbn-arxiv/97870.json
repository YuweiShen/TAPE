The application of the method in victim identification in mass disasters suggests that it could also belong to the sub-categories of information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM). The use of radiographs also suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of computer graphics and computer-aided design (cs.GR) or computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CR). Finally, the potential use of the method in healthcare and dentistry suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
