The paper also proposes a new method for representation learning, which suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses kernel methods, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research. The paper also involves classification, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with security and privacy (cs.CR) as it aims to maintain a global identity of a person moving among non-overlapping surveillance cameras."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
