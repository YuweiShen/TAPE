The proposed model is based on an iterative attention mechanism, without explicit hand detection or segmentation. Therefore, it is highly likely that this paper belongs to the cs.CV sub-category.\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with recognizing sign language, which is a form of language. The proposed model is based on an iterative attention mechanism, which is a common technique used in natural language processing. Therefore, it is possible that this paper belongs to the cs.CL sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an end-to-end model for recognizing fingerspelling sequences in ASL videos collected in the wild. The model is based on an iterative attention mechanism, which is a machine learning technique. Therefore, it is possible that this paper belongs to the cs.LG sub-category.\n4. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper deals with recognizing sign language, which is a form of communication between humans. The proposed model is based on an iterative attention mechanism, which is a technique used to improve human-computer interaction. Therefore, it is possible that this paper belongs to the cs.HC sub-category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
