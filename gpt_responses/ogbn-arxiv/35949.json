The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed technique in terms of throughput and coordination clusters, which falls under the category of system optimization (cs.SI). The use of multiple antennas and coordination clusters also suggests that the paper may fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves the use of convex optimization techniques, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
