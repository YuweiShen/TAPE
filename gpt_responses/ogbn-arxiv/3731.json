It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as the goal is to enable safe autonomous driving. Additionally, machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories are likely as the proposed method involves training a neural network. Finally, natural language processing (cs.CL) may also be a possibility as the paper involves interpreting and analyzing text."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
