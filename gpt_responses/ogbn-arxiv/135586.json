It also proposes a novel training algorithm to address the training difficulty of these networks, which is a common challenge in computer vision tasks. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories as it proposes a new method for training deep neural networks. The paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it proposes a method for improving the representational capability of 1-bit CNNs. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as it evaluates the performance of the proposed method on the depth estimation task."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
