This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) as it involves designing efficient sampling and reconstruction algorithms. The paper also discusses the use of nonadaptive sampling procedures, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS). The design of efficient algorithms for group testing is a problem in machine learning (cs.LG) and statistics (cs.SI). Finally, the application of the proposed method to detecting infected people in viral epidemics is related to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
