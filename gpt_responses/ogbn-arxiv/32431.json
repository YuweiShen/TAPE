The system uses computer vision techniques to detect obstacles and send their relative location to the robotic arm module for removal. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper heavily relies on computer vision techniques for obstacle detection, which suggests that it could also belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a method for automation, which could fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The proposed system involves machine learning techniques for obstacle detection, which could also place the paper under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper presents a system for construction monitoring, which could fall under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
