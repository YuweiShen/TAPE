The paper also uses coding theory to analyze these schemes, which falls under information theory (cs.IT) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the complexity of these schemes, which is related to data structures (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper discusses statistical techniques for evaluating the accuracy of the prover's responses, which falls under computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
