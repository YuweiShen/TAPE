This falls under the scope of discrete mathematics.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The stochastic block model is a popular model for studying community structure in social and information networks. The paper proposes an algorithm for community detection in this model, which falls under the scope of social and information networks.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a semidefinite programming algorithm for community detection, which is a machine learning technique. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper mentions information-theoretic limits determined by Abbe and Sandon (2015) for exact recovery of the latent communities. This falls under the scope of information theory.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper mentions the robustness and generalization of the proposed algorithm against a semirandom variant of the stochastic block model.
