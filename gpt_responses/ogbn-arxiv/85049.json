This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The problem of blind calibration also involves system identification and control (cs.SY), as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques for processing sensor data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
