The dataset contains images with various visual quality and artifacts, making it challenging for OCR methods. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of neural networks for text recognition, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the evaluation methodology and testset, which could be related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
