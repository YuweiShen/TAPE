The problem is also related to sorting networks, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of algorithms to solve the problem suggests that it may also be related to data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions graph isomorphism, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
