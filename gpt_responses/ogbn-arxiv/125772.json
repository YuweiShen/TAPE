The use of mutual information as a measure of feature relevance and redundancy suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) applications. The evaluation of the proposed method on UCI databases suggests a focus on data science (cs.DS). Finally, the use of gradient ascent as an optimization method suggests a focus on information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
