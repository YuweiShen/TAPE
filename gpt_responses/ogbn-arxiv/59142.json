The paper proposes a novel method for tackling the difficulty in propagating gradient through a low-precision network, which is a key challenge in training such networks. This involves introducing an auxiliary gradient module and expanding the original low-precision network with a full-precision auxiliary gradient module to formulate a mixed-precision residual network. This method involves optimization techniques and batch normalization, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also employs a stochastic structured precision strategy to promote gradient flow during backpropagation, which is a technique used in neural networks (cs.NE) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
