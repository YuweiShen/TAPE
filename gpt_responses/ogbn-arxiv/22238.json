The paper also focuses on the transparency of the process pipelines used to generate ML models, which is a key concern in the field of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the potential problems that could arise due to changes in regulations or discredited data sources, which falls under the category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). The methodology for calculating the transparency metric and the type of criteria used to make judgments on the visibility of contributions to systems are explained, which falls under the category of Software Engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the data sources used to train ML models, which falls under the category of Databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
