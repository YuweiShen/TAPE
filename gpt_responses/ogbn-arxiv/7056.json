The paper proposes a novel approach to implanting structured rational knowledge into distributed representation at morpheme level, which involves the use of machine learning techniques such as word2vec, indicating that it could also belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the evaluation of the proposed approach using word similarity measurement, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR) or Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
