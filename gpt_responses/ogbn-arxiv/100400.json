The system also includes a front-end for detecting inter-robot loop closures without exchanging raw sensor data, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The system also has an outlier rejection mechanism, which involves control systems (cs.SY) and optimization (cs.MA) techniques. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.RO, cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.SY, and cs.MA, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
