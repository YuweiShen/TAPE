The paper also discusses compression techniques, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) or databases (cs.DB). Finally, the paper presents experimental results, which could fall under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
