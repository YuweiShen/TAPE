This falls under the purview of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): Backscatter communication is a key technology for wireless sensor networks, which is a subfield of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): Backscatter communication can be used in multi-agent systems for distributed sensing and communication. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the design and implementation of scatter radio receivers, which involves control and optimization of system parameters. \n5. cs.RO (Robotics): Backscatter communication can be used in robotics for remote sensing and communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
