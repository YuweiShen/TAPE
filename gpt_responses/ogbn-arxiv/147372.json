The paper focuses on parsing spoken utterances, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The use of convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks also suggests that the paper may fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper deals with acoustic-prosodic features, which are related to speech recognition and speech synthesis, and thus may also fall under the category of sound and music computing (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
