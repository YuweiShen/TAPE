This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT), as it involves coding and transmission of information. The paper also proposes a combinatorial algorithm for optimal labeling of a directed tree, which is a problem in data structures (cs.DS). The use of caching and transmission schemes is also relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with the theoretical analysis of the lower bounds on the coded caching rate, which is related to complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
