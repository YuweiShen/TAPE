The proposed method aims to improve the quality of generated sequences by outputting smooth prediction probabilities for all the tokens in the target sequence. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category covers topics related to NLP, including machine translation and text summarization, which are the tasks evaluated in this paper. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers topics related to various machine learning techniques, including regularization methods, which are used in this paper. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers topics related to various AI techniques, including NLP and machine learning, which are used in this paper. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category covers topics related to neural networks, which are the main model used in this paper. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category covers topics related to image and video analysis, but it also includes topics related to sequence modeling, which is relevant to this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
