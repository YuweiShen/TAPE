It also involves multiple antennas at each node, which is a common feature in wireless communication networks (cs.NI). The paper also explores the concept of cognitive radio, which is a topic in signal processing and communication (cs.SI). The use of zero forcing and dirty paper encoding suggests a focus on signal processing and optimization (cs.MM). Lastly, the paper deals with the interference channel, which is a topic in communication networks and protocols (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
