The proposed approach involves the use of attention-based sequence decoding, which is a popular technique in deep learning (cs.LG). The model is trained with word-level annotations, which suggests the use of supervised learning (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also discusses the performance of the model with inaccurate bounding boxes, which is related to the problem of object detection (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
