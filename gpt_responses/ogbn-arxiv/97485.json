This involves extracting contextual attributes from network traffic and leveraging Software-Defined Network (SDN) for policy enforcement and implementation. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper also discusses the challenges of device performance overheads, sensor costs, availability, reliability, and trustworthiness, which could fall under cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the use of SDN for policy enforcement and implementation could also fall under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
