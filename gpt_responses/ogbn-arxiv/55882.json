The paper introduces a new approach to GSNs by using multimodal transition distributions, which can capture a wider range of data distributions. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), and information theory (cs.IT). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
