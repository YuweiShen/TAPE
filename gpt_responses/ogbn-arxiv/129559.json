The paper discusses the use of deep learning models for visual perception, mapping scenarios using OctoMap, and fruit modelling to estimate the geometry property of objects and access pose of each fruit. These topics are closely related to the fields of robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and systems and control (cs.SY). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
