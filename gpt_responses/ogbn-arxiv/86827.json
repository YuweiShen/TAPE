The channel is also temporally correlated, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the optimal number of receive antennas, which is a topic in networked systems (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper involves matrix analysis and optimization, which are relevant to the categories of mathematical modeling (cs.MM) and computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
