The paper also discusses the use of maximum likelihood (ML) detection, which is a common technique in machine learning and statistics, and thus the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also considers the use of random sampling matrices, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA), and the paper's focus on subspace detection may also make it relevant to the systems and control (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
