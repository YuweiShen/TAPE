Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of different CNN-based approaches and data augmentation techniques, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of object detection and evaluation protocols, which are related to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
