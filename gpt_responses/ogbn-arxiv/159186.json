This falls under the sub-category of Natural Language Processing (NLP) which is covered under cs.CL. The paper also involves the use of machine learning algorithms such as SVM, NB, and SGD which are commonly used in Information Retrieval (IR) and Machine Learning (ML) fields, hence it can also be categorized under cs.IR, cs.LG, cs.AI. Additionally, the use of normalized TFIDF and word analyzer for feature selection indicates the involvement of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, which falls under cs.DL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
