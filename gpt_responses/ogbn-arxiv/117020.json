Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a new loss function that is differentiable and can be easily appended to the back of CNNs, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of polarized predictions, which is a common technique in Neural Networks (cs.NE) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
