These objectives are relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC), systems and control (cs.SY), and computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper discusses the technical details of the proposed framework, including the use of expansion fields and precoding, which are relevant to these sub-categories. Therefore, it is likely that this paper belongs to one or more of these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
