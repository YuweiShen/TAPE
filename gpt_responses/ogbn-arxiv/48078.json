The paper also discusses the use of general object tracking, which could potentially fall under robotics (cs.RO) or multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a temporal convolution network to incorporate temporal information, which could be considered as a form of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
