Therefore, it is likely to belong to the categories of data structures (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB). The structure also has implications for networking (cs.NI) and security (cs.CR), as it is robust to certain standard errors. Finally, the paper discusses the potential for distributed implementations (cs.DC), which further supports the inclusion of this category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
