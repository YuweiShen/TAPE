The paper also introduces a strategy with two measurements to measure the policy discrepancy and improve the approximation to return. The experiments are conducted on several representative tasks from the OpenAI Gym library. Based on this, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a framework that combines different reinforcement learning algorithms to improve the performance of DQN. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a strategy to measure the policy discrepancy and improve the approximation to return. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the application of the proposed framework and strategy on several representative tasks from the OpenAI Gym library, which may include robotics tasks. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of reinforcement learning algorithms to solve sequential decision problems, which is related to systems and control. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a framework and a strategy to improve the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms, which may involve the design and analysis of algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
