The use of conditional information to guide the generation process is a common technique in deep learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of datasets such as CelebA and Youtube Faces, which are commonly used in computer vision research (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the importance of consistency and correctness in the inpainting process, which is relevant to graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
