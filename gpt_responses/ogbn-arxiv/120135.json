This topic is closely related to the field of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and specifically to Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the need to consider different stakeholders' explanatory requirements, which is relevant to the field of Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of cybersecurity in opaque computing systems, which could fall under the category of Cybersecurity (cs.CYBER). Finally, the paper discusses the philosophical and theoretical aspects of explanation in science, which could be relevant to the field of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
