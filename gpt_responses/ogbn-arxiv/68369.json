The most likely sub-category is cs.DL (Digital Libraries), as the paper discusses the creation of a large-scale dataset of citations. The next likely sub-category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval), as the paper discusses the use of SPARQL and REST APIs for querying the citation data. The paper also mentions the use of RDF and the OpenCitations Data Model, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.DB (Databases) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence).
