The use of wildcards in string matching also suggests that the paper may be relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of fast convolutions, which is a common technique in computational complexity (cs.CC). The mention of the MPC framework for parallel computation suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of distributed systems (cs.Distributed) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
