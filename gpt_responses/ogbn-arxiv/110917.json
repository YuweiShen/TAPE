The use of infrared absorption spectroscopy suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) may also be relevant. Additionally, the use of neural networks and optimization techniques suggests artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as another possible category. The focus on signal-to-noise ratio and training sample size suggests that statistical learning (cs.SD) may also be relevant. Finally, the use of neural networks suggests that neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) may also be a relevant category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
