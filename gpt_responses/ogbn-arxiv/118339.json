The method involves capturing pairwise relations between local appearance patches, which is a learning task that falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the proposed method on face datasets, which is a common task in multimedia (cs.MM) and computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
