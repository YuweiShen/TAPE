The paper specifically focuses on using deep neural networks, which is a popular topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of artificial intelligence and the potential for generalization to detect new, unknown malware families (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the scalability of the system, which could fall under software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses the use of a low resource, highly accurate machine learning classification model, which could fall under neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
