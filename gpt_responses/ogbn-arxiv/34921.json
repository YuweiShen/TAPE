The paper also discusses the use of data structures to efficiently handle insertions and deletions (cs.DS). The optimization of packing density involves combinatorial and mathematical analysis (cs.DM, cs.GT). Finally, the use of online algorithms and reallocation strategies is a common topic in the field of streaming algorithms and online optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
