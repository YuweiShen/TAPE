This involves datasets with high-dimensional features, posing big data challenges. The paper focuses on text and image datasets, which are commonly studied in the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
