The method involves aligning visual concepts with net-units and inferring concepts hierarchically, which relates to machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the explanation of net layer structure, which could be relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
