Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also uses two open datasets, MPIIGaze and Multi-PIE, which are related to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper proposes a new loss function and a multi-task network, which are related to neural networks (cs.NE) and statistical learning (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
