The use of importance sampling and variational inference suggests that the paper may belong to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The investigation of inference with elliptical distributions suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the categories of information theory (cs.IT), systems and control (cs.SY), and statistics (cs.ST)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
