Additionally, the paper proposes a fix for existing saliency methods that helps them pass sanity checks, which is a common concern in the computer vision community. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories as it deals with deep neural networks and their interpretability, which are important topics in these fields. \n\nThe neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper deals with credit-assignment via the gradient of the output with respect to input, which is a common technique in neural network training. \n\nFinally, the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category is a less likely possibility as the paper does not explicitly deal with language processing, but it could be relevant if the proposed method is applied to text-based tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
