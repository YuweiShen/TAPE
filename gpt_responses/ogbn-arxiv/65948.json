The proposed method utilizes a compression-based similarity measure, which involves encoding and decoding of images, making it relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the use of P-frame coding, which is a common technique in video compression, making it relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) again. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
