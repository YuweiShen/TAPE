The paper proposes several algorithms for generating sanitized strings that preserve the order of appearance and frequency of non-sensitive patterns, and also minimize the edit distance from the original string. These algorithms involve combinatorial techniques such as regular expression matching, partial order preservation, and letter replacement. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DB (Databases), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
