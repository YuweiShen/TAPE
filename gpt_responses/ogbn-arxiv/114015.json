The paper proposes a new method that combines two complementary models to improve tracking performance. This involves using ridge regression, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG) and the authors also mention using deep learning in their experiments. Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of existing trackers and proposes a solution, which involves developing a more robust model that can handle different types of variations. This suggests that the paper could also be classified under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions using multiple benchmarks to evaluate their method, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
