The presence of byzantine nodes also makes it relevant to the field of security and privacy (cs.CR). The proposed algorithm is based on message passing, which is a common technique in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also considers the case of Markovian system states, which falls under the category of control and optimization (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
