The paper proposes a method called AFLite to adversarially filter these biases, which can improve the generalization of models to out-of-distribution tasks. The paper also provides a theoretical understanding of AFLite and conducts experiments on a variety of datasets. Given these topics, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.CL (Computation and Language). cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) are also possible sub-categories, as they can be related to the problem of overfitting and generalization in machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
