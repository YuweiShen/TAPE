The paper also mentions polar codes, which are a type of error-correcting code and fall under cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The mention of encoding and decoding complexities also suggests a possible connection to cs.SI (Systems and Control) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the use of random codes and block error probabilities may also relate to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
