This is a common problem in machine learning, and the proposed solution is likely to be of interest to researchers in several sub-fields of computer science. The paper focuses on the optimization of unitary weight matrices, which is a topic that is relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
