The use of discrete distributions and the development of approximation techniques suggest a focus on algorithms and data structures, which is a common theme in the computer science sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also deals with probabilistic computations, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The development of approximation techniques suggests a focus on statistical learning, which is a common theme in the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with the computation of distributions, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of cs.IT (Information Theory).
