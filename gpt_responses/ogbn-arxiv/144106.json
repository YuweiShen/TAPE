The method uses graph embedding by GCNs and RNNs based sequential recommendation method named GRU4Rec. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper focuses on recommendation systems, which is a subfield of information retrieval. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper uses item co-occurrence graph to encode item association and mine it through graph embedding by GCNs. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper uses RNNs based sequential recommendation method named GRU4Rec to model sequential relationships. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not focus on cryptography and security, but it is possible that the proposed method can be applied to improve security in recommendation systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
