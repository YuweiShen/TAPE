The proposed method involves attention maps and weakly supervised learning, which are also common topics in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the use of attention and regularization techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
