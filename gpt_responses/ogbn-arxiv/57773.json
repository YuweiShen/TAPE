The use of Fourier spectra and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI). The study of correlation-immune functions over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ involves algebraic structures and mathematical properties, which aligns with the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC) as it deals with the complexity of correlation attacks on cryptosystems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
