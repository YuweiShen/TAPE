The use of deep reinforcement learning also suggests a potential fit for the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The paper also discusses stability and robustness analyses, which could fall under the systems and control (cs.SY) category. Finally, the evaluation of the method on a car model suggests a potential fit for the computer vision (cs.CV) category, although this is less likely than the other categories mentioned."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
