The proposed method involves the use of mixed $\\ell_{p,q}$ norms, which is a common technique in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the application of the method to source localization, which falls under the category of sensor networks and internet of things (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents simulation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which involves numerical analysis and optimization (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
