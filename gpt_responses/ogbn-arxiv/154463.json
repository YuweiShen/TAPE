The paper also discusses the use of dynamic programming and stochastic processes to optimize the transmission policy, which falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses mathematical optimization techniques to maximize throughput, which is a common topic in the Mathematical Optimization (cs.MA) sub-category.
