The use of computability theory and complexity theory in the analysis suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the logic in computer science (cs.LO) sub-category. The focus on safety properties and the undecidability of certain properties suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The study of tradeoffs between language characteristics suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-category. Finally, the use of negative results and sufficient conditions suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
