The paper specifically focuses on the detection of factuality and objectivity in documents and its impact on retrieval effectiveness. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval). However, since the paper also uses state-of-the-art NLP techniques, it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper uses machine learning techniques to improve retrieval effectiveness, which could also place it in cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
