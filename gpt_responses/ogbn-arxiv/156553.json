Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of linear transformations and vector space embeddings, which are common techniques in machine learning and artificial intelligence, suggesting that cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely categories.
