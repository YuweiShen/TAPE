The approach is based on training a single classifier to be adversarially robust, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the broader context of machine learning and the utility of robustness, which could fall under computer security (cs.CR) or neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
