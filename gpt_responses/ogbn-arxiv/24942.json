The paper also discusses applications in predictive diagnostics for automobiles, ECG, and protein sequence classification, which are areas of research commonly associated with machine learning and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions sentiment analysis on texts, which falls under natural language processing (cs.CL).
