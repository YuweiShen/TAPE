The paper proposes a new model for IRL based on a generalized version of the causal entropy maximization problem. This model has potential applications in robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), and control systems (cs.SY). The empirical evaluation of the proposed model is done on a real-world dataset, which suggests that the paper could also be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
