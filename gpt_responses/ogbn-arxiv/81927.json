Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The proposed framework also involves feature aggregation and similarity metrics, which are commonly used in Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) tasks. Finally, the paper evaluates the approach on standard benchmarks, which is a common practice in the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
