These techniques are commonly used in data structures and algorithms. \n3. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) - The paper employs numerical techniques such as convex splitting and the MBO scheme, which are commonly used in numerical analysis. \n4. cs.CG (Computational Geometry) - The paper discusses the optimization of network modularity, which can be viewed as a clustering problem. Clustering is a common topic in computational geometry. \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper mentions the use of an $\\ell_2$ balance term, which is related to information theory and signal processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
