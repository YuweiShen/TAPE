The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both toy-regression and few-shot image classification problems, indicating its relevance to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
