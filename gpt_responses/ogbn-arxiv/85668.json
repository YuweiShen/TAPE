This falls under the category of computer engineering (cs.CE) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also describes the use of modeling tools and methods to incorporate specific phenomena, such as driver behavior and lane changes, which could fall under the categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), information theory (cs.IT), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
