This falls under the intersection of robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of deep learning techniques (cs.AI) and object detection algorithms (cs.LG) such as YOLO and SSD. Finally, the paper involves the creation of annotated datasets (cs.MM) for use in training these algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
