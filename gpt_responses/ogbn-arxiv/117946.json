This is a core topic in information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes cooperative jamming strategies for relay networks, which is a key aspect of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper focuses on secure communication and proposes a cooperative jamming scheme to improve secrecy rate. This falls under the domain of cryptography and security.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with multiple data streams transmission in relay networks, which is a topic related to multimedia communication.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a GSVD-based secure relaying scheme and optimal power allocation via geometric programming, which are techniques used in systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
