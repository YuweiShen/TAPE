The paper also focuses on the security aspect of the communication, which falls under the Security and Privacy (cs.CR) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The use of multiple antennas suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a transmission scheme that involves orthogonalization of signals, which is a common technique in the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
