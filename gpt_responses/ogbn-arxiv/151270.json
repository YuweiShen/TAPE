The use of linear programming relaxations suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the areas of machine learning (cs.LG) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the area of game theory (cs.GT), as scheduling problems can be modeled as games between the scheduler and the jobs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
