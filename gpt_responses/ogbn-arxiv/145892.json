The paper proposes an efficient algorithm for this problem when the underlying matrix has a low rank structure, which is a common assumption in many applications. This makes the paper relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
