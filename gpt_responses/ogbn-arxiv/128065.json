The paper also discusses the vulnerability of existing collaborative learning frameworks to GAN attacks, which falls under the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category. The proposed technique involves classification models, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of high dimensional keys to improve the robustness against attacks, which could fall under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a principled training scheme, which could also fall under the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
