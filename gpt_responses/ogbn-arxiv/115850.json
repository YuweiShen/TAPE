This involves robotics technology and control algorithms for the ASV and the deployment of the drifters. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper describes an iterative planning approach that uses the ASV to strategically deploy drifters for high expected information gain, which involves decision-making and optimization algorithms. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents a system that integrates multiple components (ASV, drifters, sensors) and requires coordination and control to achieve the desired sampling objectives. \n- cs.OH (Other Computer Science): The paper's focus on ocean observations and the use of autonomous systems and sensors could also fit under this category. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): While not the main focus of the paper, the development and implementation of the system likely involved software engineering practices and considerations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
