This involves studying the behavior of other vehicles and addressing concerns from the public. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Robotics (cs.RO), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of deep neural networks for mapping input states to optimal policies, which suggests a possible connection to Computer Vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper deals with safety driving, which involves control systems and decision-making, indicating a possible connection to Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
