The use of LP relaxation and integrality gap analysis suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). The analysis of Long Codes and cross-intersecting collections of set families suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
