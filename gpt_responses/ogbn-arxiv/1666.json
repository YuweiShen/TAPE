The use of unifilar channels and the analysis of the log-likelihood ratio suggest a connection to the areas of dynamical systems (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the presence of common randomness and the study of multi-step drift may also relate to the sub-field of network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
