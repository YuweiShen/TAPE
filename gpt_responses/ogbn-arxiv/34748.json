This topic is relevant to social and information networks. \n4. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper presents a new approach to improving the quality of work in crowdsourcing platforms, which can be seen as a computational engineering problem. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper discusses the accuracy of reputation signals on crowdsourcing platforms and proposes a new system that produces more accurate signals, which is a topic related to information retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
