The paper proposes a new method to alleviate this problem, which is likely to fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments conducted in the paper involve image recognition tasks, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of stochastic gradient descent methods, which is a common optimization technique in neural networks and may indicate that the paper belongs to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the generalization performance of the network, which is a common topic in natural language processing (cs.CL) and may suggest that the paper belongs to this sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
