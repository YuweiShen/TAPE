This involves optimization using the tabu search strategy and computational experiments. The paper's focus on optimization and computational experiments suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The use of Monte Carlo method and the search for partitionings suggest that it could also belong to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Finally, the use of SAT instances and encoding problems suggest that it could belong to cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
