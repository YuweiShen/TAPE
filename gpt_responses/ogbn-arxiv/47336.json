The paper also discusses the limitations of current methods for computing the Lipschitz constant, which is relevant to the field of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes future research directions for certified adversarial defenses, which is relevant to the field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
