The use of swarm robots and their coordination without explicit communication suggests the sub-category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The concept of forming a given pattern also involves control and coordination, which falls under the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY). The algorithm used for pattern formation involves deterministic and oblivious behavior, which can be categorized under distributed systems (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
