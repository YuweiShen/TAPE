The proposed approach involves clustering the system states, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and network analysis (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the use of optimization techniques to find the optimal set of clusters, which is a topic in mathematical optimization (cs.MA) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
