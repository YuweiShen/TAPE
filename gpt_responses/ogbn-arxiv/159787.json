The paper also mentions the encoding of action semantics related to the environment, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of Spatio-Temporal Affordance Maps (STAM) involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the application of this framework to support the execution of robot tasks involves control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
