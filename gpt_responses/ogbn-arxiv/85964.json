It uses a convolutional neural network (U-net) architecture with a supervised learning objective and incorporates transfer learning. Therefore, it is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses a machine-learning approach to classify the phases of surface wave dispersion curves. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a convolutional neural network (U-net) architecture with a supervised learning objective and incorporates transfer learning. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper converts standard FTAN analysis of surfaces observed on an array of receivers to an image, which is then classified using a convolutional neural network. \n- cs.SD (Sound): The paper deals with extracting dispersion curves from ambient noise correlations, which is related to sound. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The developed technique will facilitate automated processing of large dispersion curve datasets, which is related to software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
