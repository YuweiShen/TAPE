This involves natural language processing and understanding, which falls under the scope of cs.CL.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses reinforcement learning to improve the rule-based agent, which is a common technique in AI. The development of a conversational agent also involves machine learning and decision-making, which are key areas of AI.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper aims to improve the user experience of voice-based services by addressing the problem of skill discovery. This involves understanding user needs and preferences, which is a key aspect of HCI.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper addresses the problem of skill discovery, which can be seen as a form of information retrieval. The conversational agent helps users find the skills that serve their request, which involves searching and ranking relevant skills.\n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper presents a real production setting where the conversational agent is deployed to interact with real users. This involves software engineering aspects such as testing, deployment, and maintenance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
