This involves the use of logical frameworks and type checking, which are topics typically covered in the areas of logic (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses implementation and reasoning about specifications, which are relevant to software engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper touches on the topic of type reconstruction, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
