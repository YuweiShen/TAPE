Specifically, the paper focuses on the use of a default policy to leverage repeated structure in the state space or time. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses empirical results in both discrete and continuous action domains, which suggests that it may also be relevant to subfields such as robotics (cs.RO) or computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses connections to information bottleneck approaches and the variational EM algorithm, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
