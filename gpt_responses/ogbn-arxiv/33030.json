The proposed approach involves the use of a self-attention mechanism, which is a common technique in natural language processing (NLP) and falls under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category. The paper also mentions the use of a shallower network to reduce computational complexity, which is a common concern in machine learning and falls under the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category. The experiments involve the use of public benchmarks, which is a common practice in information retrieval (IR) and falls under the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) category.
