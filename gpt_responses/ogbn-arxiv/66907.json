This approach is more scalable computationally and more reliable than local optima often found via optimization. The paper also estimates the dimensionality of the data. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of an optimizer and the estimation of dimensionality, which are relevant to the sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
