This involves modeling uncertainties using polynomial chaos expansion and incorporating chance constraints to limit the probability of constraint violations. The method involves a detailed and flexible description of controllable variables and system states. Given these characteristics, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the operation of power systems, which involves control and optimization of complex systems. The use of chance constraints and polynomial chaos expansion to model uncertainties also falls under the purview of systems and control.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of polynomial chaos expansion to model uncertainties is a machine learning technique that falls under the purview of AI. The optimization problem also involves finding the best solution among a range of possible operating conditions, which is a common theme in AI.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The optimization problem involves finding the optimal solution for a large-scale power system, which may require distributed or parallel computing techniques to solve efficiently.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The use of chance constraints and polynomial chaos expansion to model uncertainties is a technique that can be used in conjunction with neural networks or evolutionary algorithms to solve optimization problems.\n- cs.LG (Machine"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
