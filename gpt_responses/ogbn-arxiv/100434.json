The use of binary encoding also suggests a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The study of rank and size of refutations is related to proof complexity (cs.LO). Finally, the application of these concepts to the SA-Lasserre refutation system suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
