Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of sharing gNB components on customization and isolation, which could fall under Information Theory (cs.IT) and Architecture (cs.AR) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a 3GPP/NFV-based description model, which could be related to Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
