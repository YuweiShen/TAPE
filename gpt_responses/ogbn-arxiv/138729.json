The use of ASP (Answer Set Programming) as a tool for planning makes it relevant to the logic and verification (cs.LO) sub-category. The paper also discusses the engineering of a cost-optimal planner, which falls under the programming languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The experiments conducted to compare the proposed approaches with the only known cost-optimal planner in SAT (Boolean satisfiability problem) make it relevant to the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the potential of stepless planning, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
