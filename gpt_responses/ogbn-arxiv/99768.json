This problem is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper also proposes modifications to an existing scheme, which involves data structures (cs.DS) and optimization techniques (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for generalization of the proposed method, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
