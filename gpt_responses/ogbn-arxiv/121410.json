This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The proposed approach uses deep autoencoder, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) as a feature, which is a key aspect of wireless networking (cs.NI). Finally, the paper deals with the overall system of interconnected vehicles, which can be seen as a complex system (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
