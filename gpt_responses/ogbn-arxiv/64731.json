The paper focuses on optimizing the objective function and proposes two smooth approximations of the objective function. The experiments are conducted on two widely used benchmarks, namely, the MovieLens data set and the Amazon Video Games data set. Based on the content of the paper, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is Information Retrieval (cs.IR), followed by Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
