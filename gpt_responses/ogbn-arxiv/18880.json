Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are the most likely categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a language-independent approach, which involves machine learning and feature engineering, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) also relevant categories. Finally, since the paper deals with named entities, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a possible category, although less likely than the others."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
