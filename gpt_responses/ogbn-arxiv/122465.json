The problem studied in the paper, the {\\sc $k$-Leaf-Out-Branching} problem, is a graph problem, which suggests that the paper belongs to the Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) or Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. The use of extremal combinatorics in obtaining the kernel suggests that the paper may also belong to the Computational Geometry (cs.CG) or Graph Theory (cs.GT) sub-categories.
