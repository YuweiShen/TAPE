This problem is relevant to several areas of computer science, including computer vision (cs.CV), graphics (cs.GR), optimization and control (cs.OH), information theory (cs.IT), and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper proposes a new approach to NLOS imaging that involves transforming the problem into a virtual Line-Of-Sight (LOS) one, and introduces the concept of the phasor field to model NLOS light transport. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reconstructing complex scenes with strong multiply scattered and ambient light, arbitrary materials, large depth range, and occlusions, which suggests that the paper is likely to be of interest to researchers in several of the aforementioned sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
