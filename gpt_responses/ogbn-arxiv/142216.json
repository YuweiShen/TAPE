The proposed approach involves using abstract interpretation to reason about the behavior of embedded JavaScript code, which is a technique commonly used in software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL). The use of abstract interpretation also involves analyzing the behavior of the code statically, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY).
