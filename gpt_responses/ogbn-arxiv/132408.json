This involves designing a multi-market, dynamic double auction mechanism that is truthful, feasible, individual-rational, no-deficit, and computationally efficient. Game theory is relevant to the design and analysis of such mechanisms, making cs.GT a likely sub-category.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a type of emerging user-assisted mobile applications or services, referred to as Dynamic Mobile Ad-hoc Crowd Service (DMACS), which are provided and consumed by users carrying smart mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) who are in close proximity of each other (e.g., within Bluetooth range). This involves addressing radio range constraints, multi-group or multi-market dynamic double auction problem, and efficient communication among users. Networking and internet architecture are relevant to the design and analysis of such systems, making cs.NI a likely sub-category.\n- cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper deals with a system where users carrying smart mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) interact with each other to provide and consume services. This involves designing an auction mechanism that incentivizes users' participation and ensures fair trading.
