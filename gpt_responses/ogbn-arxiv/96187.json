The paper also extensively uses convolutional neural networks (cs.LG) and incorporates traditional multiview stereo concepts (cs.GR) within a deep learning framework. Additionally, the paper involves context-aware cost aggregation and regression, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
