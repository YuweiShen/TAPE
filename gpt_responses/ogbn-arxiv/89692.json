This problem falls under the category of reinforcement learning, which is typically studied in the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also involves game theory (cs.GT) in its analysis of the algorithm's performance. Finally, the use of bandit feedback involves information theory (cs.IT) concepts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
