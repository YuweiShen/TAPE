The paper proposes a new method for network inference that uses dynamical structure functions and a powerful numerical sampling method. This method can be used in a wide range of applications, such as controller design, machinery fault diagnosis, and therapy development. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SI (Systems and Control), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
