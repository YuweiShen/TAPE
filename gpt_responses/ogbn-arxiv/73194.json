This category is therefore highly likely.\n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper presents a lower bound for the RNA folding problem, which is a problem in computational complexity. This category is also highly likely.\n3. cs.CG (Computational Geometry) - The RNA folding problem can be viewed as a problem in computational geometry, where the goal is to find a maximum cardinality set of crossing-free pairs. This category is therefore likely.\n4. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) - The paper presents a reduction from RNA folding to the Dyck edit distance problem, which is a problem in game theory.
