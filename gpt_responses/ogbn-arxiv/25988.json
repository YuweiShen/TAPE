Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The use of deep architectures and layer normalization suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The fact that the systems are trained with Nematus, an attentional encoder-decoder, indicates that the paper may also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions the use of back-translated monolingual training data, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as this technique is commonly used in image translation tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
