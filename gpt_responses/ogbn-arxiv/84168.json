This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as it deals with protecting against attacks on hardware. Additionally, the paper involves modifications to the design flow and library databases, which are related to software engineering (cs.SE) and computer architecture (cs.AR). The topic of side-channel attacks also has relevance to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and emerging technologies (cs.ET) such as quantum computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
