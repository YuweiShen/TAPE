This falls under the domain of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of similarity constraints and ranking constraints, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on two applications: multiple object recognition and facial action unit detection, which are both related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
