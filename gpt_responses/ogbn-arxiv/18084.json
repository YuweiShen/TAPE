Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the behavior of noisy circuits and broadcasting of information on trees, which suggests that it may belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.DS (Dynamical Systems), respectively. The development of tools for evaluating the Dobrushin curve of additive-noise channels may also place the paper in cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
