Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves signal processing and information theory, which suggests that it could belong to cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of Wi-Fi signals, which falls under cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Finally, the paper proposes a novel de-noising method, which could be considered as a machine learning approach, and thus, it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
