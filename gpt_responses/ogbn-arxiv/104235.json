The paper specifically focuses on the limitations of deep representations in artistic domain generalisation. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of deep learning algorithms, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the importance of higher-order representations such as structure and shape, which could place it in the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper uses the PACS benchmark, which is a dataset of images, indicating that it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
