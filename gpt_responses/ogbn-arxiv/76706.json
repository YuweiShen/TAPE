The focus on binary classification also suggests a connection to computer vision and pattern recognition. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The use of proper scoring rules and excess risk bounds suggests a connection to statistical theory, which makes cs.ST (Statistics Theory) a likely sub-category as well. Finally, the use of different surrogate loss functions suggests a connection to optimization and algorithms, which makes cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
