Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper proposes a distributed risk-aware ML solution for RRM, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with ensuring reliability and meeting delay requirements, which could place it in the sub-categories of cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
