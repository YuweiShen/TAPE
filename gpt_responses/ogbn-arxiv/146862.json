The use case of the proposed method is in long-term care homes, which involves monitoring and measuring nutritional intake, and thus can also be categorized under human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and cybernetics (cs.CY). The method involves training a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on a novel dataset, which can also be categorized under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
