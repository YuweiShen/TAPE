The paper also discusses the construction of a cost volume pyramid, which is a technique used in graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO) for 3D reconstruction and mapping. The use of neural networks for depth inference also falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
