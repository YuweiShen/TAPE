The use of stochastic decompositions to obtain light spanners is a technique from probability theory and information theory (cs.IT), and the analysis of the sparsity and lightness of the spanners involves mathematical optimization and numerical analysis (cs.MS and cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
