This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep learning algorithms for computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE) is also mentioned in the paper. Finally, the proposed approach involves a novel hierarchical-actions algorithm that mediates the environment-agent interaction, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
