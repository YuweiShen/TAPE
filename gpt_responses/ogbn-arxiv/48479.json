The paper also proposes a new ensemble learning framework, which involves training a meta-learner to improve the results of base-learners, and this falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of unlabeled data to improve the model, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
