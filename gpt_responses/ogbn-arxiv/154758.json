The paper also discusses the need for custom datasets to train neural networks, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper proposes a methodology to monitor the quality of annotations during the labeling of images, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Overall, the paper's main focus on computer vision and deep learning suggests that cs.CV is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.AI and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
