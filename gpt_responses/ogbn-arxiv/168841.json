The proposed method involves expressing shapes of breast masses as points on the Kendall's shape manifold and using the full Procrustes distance to develop support vector machine classifiers. This approach involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The use of machine learning also suggests artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as a likely sub-category. The paper also involves statistical analysis (cs.MS) and medical imaging (cs.MM) which are relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
