This topic falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the performance analysis of the proposed algorithms, which could be categorized under signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper deals with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which could be categorized under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
