The paper also mentions static timing analysis, which is a common technique used in computer architecture (cs.AR) and digital circuits (cs.DC). The proposed clock tree design is scalable and has been verified for capacitance, slew, and skew, which are important parameters in electromagnetics (cs.EM) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
