The use of weak supervision and incorporation of action labels also suggests that it could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The use of videos in the experiments could also make it relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
