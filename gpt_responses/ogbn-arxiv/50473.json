The methodology is also efficient, which suggests a focus on algorithms and computational complexity, placing it in the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) category. The paper also mentions experiments, which could indicate a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC) or information retrieval (cs.IR) in terms of evaluating the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
