This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also proposes a novel algorithm based on concepts from semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and Gaussian randomization, which falls under the domain of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, which falls under the domain of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
