The proposed approach involves expressing the metric as a function of easy-to-optimize surrogates and solving the optimization problem over a relaxed surrogate space. This approach is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
