The paper proposes an adaptive filtering based robust CS reconstruction algorithm, which combines the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) with $l_0$ regularization. Therefore, the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.CV (computer vision) and cs.SI (social and information networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
