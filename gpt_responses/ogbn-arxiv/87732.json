This is a core topic in information theory.\n2. cs.DS (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper mentions distributed storage systems as one of the applications of error correcting codes in the erasure channel. This suggests a connection to distributed computing.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper mentions wireless sensor networks as another application of error correcting codes in the erasure channel. This suggests a connection to networked systems and possibly social networks.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with error correction in communication channels, which is a core topic in networking and internet architecture.\n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the decoding complexity of various algorithms and proposes a new algorithm with lower decoding complexity. This suggests a connection to computational complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
