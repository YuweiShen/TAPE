The paper also extends a previously proposed decomposition approach for learning Bayesian networks (BNs) to MVR CGs. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The paper also discusses computational independence tests, which could place it in the sub-categories cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
