This suggests a focus on computer vision techniques.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper mentions the deployment of hundreds of millions of smart meters to build the smart grid system, which suggests a focus on information networks.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions non-technical losses (NTLs) as a major concern for power grid security risks, which suggests a focus on security and cryptography.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a deep learning model that takes the transformed images as input, which suggests a focus on neural computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
