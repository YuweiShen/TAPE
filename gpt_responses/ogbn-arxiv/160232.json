The paper proposes a novel algorithm that enables dynamic replanning in belief space, which is a key challenge in this area. The paper also presents experimental results on a physical robot, which demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed algorithm. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.RO (Robotics). \n\nThe paper also involves the use of sampling-based methods and belief space planning, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence and control systems research. Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely sub-categories. \n\nFinally, the paper deals with the problem of updating plans in response to changes in the environment, which involves processing sensor data and image analysis. Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
