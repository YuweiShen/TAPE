The paper focuses on modeling long-range temporal structures in videos, which is a common problem in computer vision. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses good practices for training deep networks with limited samples, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper proposes a new method for motion modeling, which could be relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also discusses the use of multi-scale temporal window integration, which suggests that it may belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
