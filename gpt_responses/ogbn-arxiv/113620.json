The paper also discusses parameterizations of cost functions and social cost approximation, which are topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and economics (cs.EC). The use of iterative mechanisms and group-strategyproofness also suggests a connection to learning theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
