The use of deep neural architectures and multitask learning also suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the mention of bidirectional-LSTM and multi-layer perceptron suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category cs.CV (Computer Vision) as these are commonly used in image processing tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
