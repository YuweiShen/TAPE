The use of an ensemble of independent repetitions of the time series to obtain time-resolved estimates for a family of entropy combinations is a machine learning approach, which falls under the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with the analysis of coupled electronic circuits, which is a topic in the subfield of systems and control (cs.SY). The use of probability densities and entropy combinations is also relevant to the subfield of statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with the assessment of coupling dynamics, which is a topic in the subfield of neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
