This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper deals with the detection of fatigue in human drivers, which is a human-centered problem. The database can be used to develop and evaluate algorithms for improving human-computer interaction in the context of driving.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper involves the creation of a video database, which is a multimedia resource. The database contains videos of different head orientations, facial expressions, and illumination variations, which can be used for multimedia analysis and processing.\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of passive Near Infra-red (NIR) illumination for illuminating the face during night driving. This involves the retrieval of information from the environment to improve the quality of the video data.\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper mentions the use of algorithms for detecting driver fatigue based on facial features such as eye closure rates, eye gaze, head nodding, blink frequency, etc. This involves the application of machine learning techniques for developing and evaluating such algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
