The use of AMP algorithms is also a common technique in this field. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Matrix completion, robust PCA, and dictionary learning are all tasks commonly studied in machine learning. \n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision): Blind deconvolution is a common problem in computer vision, and the use of bilinear recovery techniques could be useful in this context. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Joint-channel/symbol estimation is a problem commonly studied in communication networks, which falls under the umbrella of social and information networks. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): Compressive sensing with matrix uncertainty is a problem that arises in multimedia applications, such as image and video compression."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
