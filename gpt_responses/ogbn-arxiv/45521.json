This involves image processing techniques such as score-line detection and feature selection, which are commonly studied in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of HMMs for modeling the writing style of the writers falls under the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques for retrieving the writer-specific confidence scores. Overall, the paper covers multiple sub-categories of computer science, but the focus on image processing and machine learning techniques makes cs.CV and cs.LG the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
