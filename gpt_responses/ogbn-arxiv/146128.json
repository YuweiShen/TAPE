The use of the applied pi calculus and ProVerif tool suggests a focus on formal methods and logic (cs.LO), while the mention of cryptographic primitives and protocols suggests a focus on programming languages and compilers (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also discusses attacks on privacy properties, which could fall under the category of cybercrime (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
