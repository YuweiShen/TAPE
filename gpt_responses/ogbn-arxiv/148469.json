This falls under the scope of information theory (cs.IT), networked systems (cs.NI), communication (cs.COMM), and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper introduces a new analytical methodology, which involves the computation of integrals, which could also fall under the scope of mathematical analysis (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
