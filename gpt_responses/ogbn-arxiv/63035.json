This is applicable to feedforward neural network architectures and can be integrated into existing machine learning libraries with relatively little overhead, facilitating the development of novel second-order optimization methods. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
