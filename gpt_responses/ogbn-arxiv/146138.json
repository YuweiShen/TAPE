Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the use of non-linear functions, which is a common topic in the Neural Networks sub-category (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of the network for classification and regression problems, which are common topics in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories.
