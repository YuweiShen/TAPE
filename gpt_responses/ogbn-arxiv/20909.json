This suggests that the paper is relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks.\n- cs.SD (Software Development): The paper describes an algorithmic framework for producing graph drawings, which could be considered a software development topic.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the use of force-directed layout algorithms and introduces a scaling technique, which are both topics within data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper applies the technique to social networks produced by Mark Lombardi, an artist who created drawings of political and social networks.
