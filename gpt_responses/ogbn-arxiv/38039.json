The use of spectral methods and semidefinite programming (SDP) is a common approach to these problems, which suggests categories such as cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The paper also discusses the running time of the algorithm, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
