This problem is at the intersection of robotics, artificial intelligence, control systems, machine learning, and computer vision. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
