The paper proposes a hardware accelerator design for deep learning that focuses on improving inference efficiency by eliminating ineffectual computation caused by zero value weights and zero bits in non-zero weights. This is relevant to the fields of hardware architecture, computer vision, and neural computing. The proposed split-and-accumulate (SAC) computing pattern and weight kneading technique also have implications for systems and control and embedded systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
