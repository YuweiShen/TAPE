The proposed contributions of combining object and location information and introducing Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks also suggest a focus on improving the accuracy and efficiency of the model, which aligns with the goals of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
