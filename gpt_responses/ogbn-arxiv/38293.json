This is a core topic in AI research.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of machine learning tools in decision-making and the need for fairness in such systems. The human-subject experiments also involve training a machine learning model to predict recidivism.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the social implications of automated decision-making systems and the need to consider the social context in which they operate. This is a key topic in the field of computers and society.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper briefly discusses the potential security risks of automated decision-making systems and the need to ensure fairness in such systems to prevent discrimination and bias.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the social context in which automated decision-making systems operate and the need to consider the social network of decision subjects. The human-subject experiments also involve social network analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
