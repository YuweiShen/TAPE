The use of deep learning and convolutional neural networks also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The establishment of a large-scale video database and the observation of temporal correlation and similar patterns of rain across video frames may also suggest that it could belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
