The model is parametric on two probability distribution functions governing block production and communication delay, which are key to understanding the efficiency criteria associated with fast blockchains. \n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper proposes a distributed hierarchical data structure of blocks that has found several applications in various industries. The model is equipped with simulation algorithms for both bounded and unbounded number of distributed copies of the blockchain. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper discusses the efficiency criteria associated with fast blockchains for identifying when increasing the block production will have negative impact on the stability of the distributed data structure given the network's broadcast delay. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper proposes a random network model for blockchains that captures the complexity of the mechanism used to synchronize the many distributed local copies of a blockchain.
