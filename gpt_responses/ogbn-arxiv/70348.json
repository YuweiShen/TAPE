The study also involves human subjects selecting verbal expressions to describe probability updates, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of Bayesian inference systems and probability calculations suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the study's focus on communication and language use could also be relevant to the field of cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
