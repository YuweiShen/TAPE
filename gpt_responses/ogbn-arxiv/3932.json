The use of Bayesian Patch Representations and ensemble learning also suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) focus. The mention of efficiency and handling unknown patterns suggests a multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the mention of robustness and handling occlusions suggests a potential focus on computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
