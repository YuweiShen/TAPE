This paper belongs to the field of natural language processing and information retrieval, as it focuses on developing a system for automatically extracting information from news articles. Specifically, it uses syntactic and domain-specific rules to extract answers to the 5W1H questions, which are commonly used in news analysis. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), followed by cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
