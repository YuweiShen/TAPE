The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques such as conditional random fields (CRFs) to learn the labeling scheme of humans for agent plans, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the importance of making robot plans easily understandable to humans, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also discusses the evaluation of the approach using physical robots, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the use of machine learning techniques to compute plan explicability and predictability, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
