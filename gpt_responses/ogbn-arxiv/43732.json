This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper introduces a temporal aggregation module to model temporal dependencies in a video, which could also place it in the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The use of deep subnets and compact subnets suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the reduction in computational costs, which could place it in the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
