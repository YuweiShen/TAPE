It also mentions identifying discriminating words, which is a common task in computational linguistics. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category because authorship attribution is a task related to information retrieval. \n\nThe machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category is also a possibility because the paper mentions that the method performs well without handcrafting and tuning, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques. \n\nThe artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category is another possibility because the paper uses a statistical test to identify changes between word frequency tables, which is a common task in artificial intelligence. \n\nFinally, the computer science and game theory (cs.CC) sub-category is a less likely possibility because the paper does not explicitly mention game theory, but the Higher Criticism test has been used in game theory research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
