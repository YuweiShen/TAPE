The paper proposes a solution using tree codes, which are a well-known concept in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also deals with the practical implementation of these codes in a control system setting (cs.SY), and discusses the complexity of the decoding algorithm (cs.DS). The paper includes numerical simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution (cs.NI), and also discusses the theoretical framework for studying such problems (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
