The paper also introduces a general technique for proving lower bounds on succinct data structures, which could be of interest to researchers in computational complexity (cs.CC) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also involves counting and selecting operations, which are common in the area of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper discusses upper and lower bounds, which are typically studied in the area of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
