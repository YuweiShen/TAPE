The paper also introduces a new model layer for adapting deep networks for open set recognition, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The methodology involves estimating probabilities, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the evaluation is done using pre-trained networks on ImageNet, which is a popular dataset in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
