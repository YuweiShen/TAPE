This method is proposed to address the limitations of the vector space model (VSM) method, which is originally proposed for information retrieval systems but suffers from several limitations when applied to patent analysis tasks. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories of arXiv CS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
