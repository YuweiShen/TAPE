These techniques are commonly used in the field of data compression, which falls under the category of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of FPGA for data acquisition, which is related to Embedded Systems (cs.ET). The paper also discusses the use of probability distributions and entropy coding, which are topics in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (cs.AR). The implementation of the compression system involves programming and optimization, which are topics in Software Engineering (cs.SE) and Programming Languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
