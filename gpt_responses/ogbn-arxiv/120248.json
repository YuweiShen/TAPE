Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also introduces a novel postprocessing scheme using regression, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper uses causal inference, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the proposed method involves lexical-level evaluation tasks, which are related to computational linguistics (cs.CE). Finally, the paper also mentions downstream sentiment analysis tasks, which are related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
