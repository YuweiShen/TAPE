The paper also involves machine learning techniques, specifically Gaussian mixture models, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of simulations and evaluations, which could place it in the cs.CV (Computer Vision) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories.
