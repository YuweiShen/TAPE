The paper proposes algorithms inspired by Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty Linear bandit (OFUL) and analyzes their regret bounds. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper involves information theory and optimization, which makes cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
