The paper also discusses the mathematical properties of these networks, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of band-limited functions and cartoon functions suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.NA) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper's emphasis on structural properties of images suggests a possible connection to computer graphics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
