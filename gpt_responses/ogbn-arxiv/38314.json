The method also involves interpretability analyses, which falls under the category of explainable AI (cs.AI). The use of specific parts of a CNN for specific tasks also relates to neural architecture search (cs.NE). Finally, the paper's focus on applying CNNs with given knowledge could also be relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
