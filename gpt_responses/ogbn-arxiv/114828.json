The paper uses information-theoretic measures to quantify the strength of the effect of one user's content on another's. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including social networks (cs.SI), data structures and algorithms (cs.SD), computational linguistics (cs.CL), cybernetics (cs.CY), and cryptography and security (cs.CR). However, given the focus on social influence and content dynamics, cs.SI and cs.SD are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.CL, cs.CY, and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
