This falls under the sub-category of Information Theory (cs.IT) and Finite Fields and Polynomials (cs.FM). The paper also discusses some results on Euclidean and Hermitian constacyclic codes, which are related to algebraic coding theory and could be classified under Cryptography and Security (cs.CR), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), and Systems and Control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
