This falls under the scope of Information Theory (cs.IT) and its sub-category Information Theory and Probability (cs.ITP). Additionally, the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) and Signal Processing (cs.SI) due to its focus on communication channels and channel state information. The use of multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver may also make the paper relevant to Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
