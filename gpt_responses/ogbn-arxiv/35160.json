This work involves computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML) techniques to learn effective unimodal representation and perform audiovisual tasks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SD (Sound), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper involves deep learning techniques and clustering algorithms, which are related to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
