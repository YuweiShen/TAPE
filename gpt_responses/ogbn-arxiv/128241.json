The paper also focuses on the use of static features such as Intents, Permissions, and API calls, which are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning models (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of data augmentation to harden the classifier against attacks, which is a topic related to software engineering (cs.SE). The use of deep learning models for malware detection also falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of feature level malware obfuscation, which is a topic related to system and network security (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
