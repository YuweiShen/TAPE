This involves modeling the smart things as physical agents with a body composed of a microcontroller, sensors, and actuators, and a brain represented by an artificial neural network. The behavior of these agents is autonomously configured through an evolutionary algorithm. This work involves aspects of multi-agent systems (cs.MA), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), control systems (cs.SY), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
