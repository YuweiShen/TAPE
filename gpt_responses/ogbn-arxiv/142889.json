This falls under the domain of AI in Education (AIEd), which is a subfield of AI. The paper proposes a pre-training method for IESs, which involves assessment modeling. This involves predicting assessments based on student-system interactions, which can be considered a form of machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI and cs.LG. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of student interaction data, which can be considered a form of data mining, and the relevance of assessments in educational problems, which can be considered a form of pedagogy. Therefore, the sub-categories cs.CY, cs.CL, and cs.CE are also likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
