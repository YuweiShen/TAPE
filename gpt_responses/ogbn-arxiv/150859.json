This makes it likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper also deals with the problem of establishing correspondences across objects, which involves graph matching and optimization, making it relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach that uses a symmetry prior to learn stable keypoints, which involves modeling and inference, making it relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
