The codes are also used in secret sharing and authentication schemes, which are topics in cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also mentions applications in consumer electronics, communication, and data storage systems, which are topics in distributed systems (cs.DS) and computer networks (cs.CC). Finally, the paper presents a coding-theory approach to the characterization of highly nonlinear Boolean functions, which is a topic in cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
