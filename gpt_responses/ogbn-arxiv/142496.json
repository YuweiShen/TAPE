The focus is on achieving full diversity and full rate, which are related to system performance and optimization (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of partial channel state information, which is a common topic in networking (cs.NI). Finally, the paper proposes a new precoding scheme, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
