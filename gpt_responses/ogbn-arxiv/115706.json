The paper specifically focuses on the use of local intrinsic dimensionality (LID) to study adversarial subspaces, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI, cs.NE). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.LG, cs.CV, and cs.CR, followed by cs.AI and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
