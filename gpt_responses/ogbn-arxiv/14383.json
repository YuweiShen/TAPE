The paper also proposes a new model for copying references and citations, which could be relevant to the subfield of computational social science (CY). Additionally, the paper uses empirical data to validate the proposed model, which could be of interest to researchers in the subfield of social informatics (SI). Finally, the paper discusses the densification of bibliographic networks, which is a topic of interest in the subfield of software engineering (SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
