Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). \n\nAdditionally, the paper also discusses the challenges in designing and implementing such a system, which involves hardware-based trusted execution environments. This aspect of the paper makes it relevant to the sub-category cs.SI (Systems and Control), which deals with the design and implementation of complex systems. \n\nThe paper also mentions the minimal changes required for integration into popular web platforms like WordPress, which falls under the sub-category cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). \n\nFurthermore, the paper discusses the usability and deployability of the proposed solution, which is relevant to the sub-category cs.SE (Software Engineering). \n\nFinally, the paper addresses the issue of password theft, which is a common concern in the sub-category cs.CY (Computers and Society), which deals with the social and ethical implications of computing technology."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
