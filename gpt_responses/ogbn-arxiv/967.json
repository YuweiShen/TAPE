It also uses a Bayesian approach to treat the value of a policy in a modeling MDP as the log prior probability of the policy. Additionally, the paper presents empirical evidence that this prior speeds up learning of the mentor's policy. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it deals with learning from demonstrations and modeling the behavior of a mentor. \n\nThe robotics (cs.RO) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper deals with learning how to behave in a stochastic environment, which is relevant to robotics. \n\nThe systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category is another possibility as the paper deals with learning how to behave in a stochastic environment, which is relevant to control systems. \n\nFinally, the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category is a possibility as the paper deals with learning from demonstrations, which is relevant to computer vision tasks such as object recognition and tracking."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
