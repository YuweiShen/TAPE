It is also likely to belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) because it proposes a new algorithm for meta learning based on Evolution Strategies (ES) that can handle new types of nonsmooth adaptation operators. Additionally, the paper's empirical results show that the proposed ES-MAML algorithm is competitive with existing methods in computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) domains."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
