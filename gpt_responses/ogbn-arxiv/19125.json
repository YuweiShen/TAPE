The paper specifically focuses on adapting evaluation metrics for MRC systems, which is a common topic in the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper involves statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, which are also relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Information retrieval (cs.IR) is another relevant sub-category, as MRC systems are often used for information retrieval tasks. Finally, neural networks (cs.NE) may also be relevant, as deep learning models are commonly used for MRC systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
