Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel annotation enrichment strategy using neural networks, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG - Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI - Artificial Intelligence) and natural language processing (cs.CL - Computation and Language) for data annotation. Finally, the experiments involve the use of image and video processing techniques (cs.MM - Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
