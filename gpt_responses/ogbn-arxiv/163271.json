Additionally, the use of neural sequence-to-sequence models and beam search are also common techniques in NLP. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with the development of a new method to improve the performance of abstractive summarization models. \n\nThe sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) is also likely as the paper discusses the use of neural networks and loss functions to improve the performance of the summarization model. \n\nInformation Retrieval (cs.IR) is another possible sub-category as text summarization is often used in information retrieval systems to provide users with a brief overview of a document or set of documents. \n\nFinally, Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) is a possible sub-category as the paper discusses the use of neural networks to improve the performance of the summarization model."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
