The paper also proposes practical implications for improving app-navigation experiences, which further supports this category. \n\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper proposes a model to distinguish informational pages and transitional pages, which is related to information retrieval. The study also involves analyzing a large dataset, which could involve techniques from information retrieval. \n\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper discusses the lack of direct links between mobile apps and the potential for developing 'tunnels' between isolated apps. This is related to the concept of social and information networks, where connections between nodes (in this case, apps) are important. \n\n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - The paper involves analyzing text data (app names, page titles, etc.) and proposing a model to distinguish different types of pages. This is related to the field of natural language processing, which falls under this category. \n\n5. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses practical implications for improving app-navigation experiences, which is related to the impact of technology on society. The study also involves collecting data from smartphone users, which could raise ethical and privacy concerns, further"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
