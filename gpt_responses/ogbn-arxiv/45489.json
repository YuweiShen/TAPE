It discusses the impact of probabilistic shaping on signal-to-noise ratios and achievable information rates, which are key metrics in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also involves experiments with transmission systems, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper deals with fiber nonlinearities, which is a topic in optics (cs.OH) and photonics (cs.PH). Finally, the paper involves optimization algorithms and models, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
