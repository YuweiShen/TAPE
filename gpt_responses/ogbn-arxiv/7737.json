This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses methods for adjusting transmission rates and ensuring termination of the broadcast, which could fall under Information Theory (cs.IT) or Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC). The paper also mentions control methods, which could fall under Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper explores the performance of the proposed protocol through simulations, which could fall under Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
