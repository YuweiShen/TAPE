The exploration strategy involves the use of a utility function to maximize the reduction of map entropy, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of occupancy mapping and frontier extraction, which are techniques commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV). The integration of motion planning and exploration is a key aspect of the paper, which falls under the field of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a novel method for exploration, which involves the optimization of a utility function, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
