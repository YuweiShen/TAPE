Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also introduces a system for running Spark programs as web services, which could fall under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also showcases a method for deep object detection, which falls under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper mentions micro-service orchestration, which could fall under cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the paper mentions usage across batch, streaming, and RESTful web serving scenarios, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
