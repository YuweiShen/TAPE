The paper also involves deep learning techniques such as DCNN and BRNN with LSTM, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the security aspect of license plate recognition, which could be categorized under cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper involves optimization techniques for mobile and embedded devices, which could be categorized under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
