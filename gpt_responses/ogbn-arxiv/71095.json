The techniques involve photometric transformation and label distillation, which are related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of deep learning models (cs.MM) and pseudo-label techniques (cs.IR) for breast density prediction. Finally, the paper involves the joint learning of multiple networks (cs.DL) for optimal photometric transformation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
