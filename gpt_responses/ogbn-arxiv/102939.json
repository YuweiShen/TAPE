Therefore, cs.AI and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the Piece-Wise Linearity (PWL) property, which is relevant to control systems (cs.SY) and fuzzy logic (cs.FL). Finally, the paper proposes benchmark examples for testing FRI methods, which could be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
