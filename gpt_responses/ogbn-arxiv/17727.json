The most likely category is cs.MM (Multimedia), as the paper focuses on analyzing emotional arcs in movies using both audio and visual data. The paper also uses deep convolutional neural networks for sentiment analysis, which suggests it could belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) or cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper uses clustering approaches to discover distinct classes of emotional arcs, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
