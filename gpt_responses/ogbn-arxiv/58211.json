The paper specifically focuses on pronominal anaphora, which is a discourse-level ambiguity in NLP. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related topics. The paper also proposes an evaluation measure and a test suite, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the ongoing neural revolution in machine translation, which involves deep learning techniques, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another possible sub-category. The paper also mentions the need for specialized evaluation measures, which involves optimization techniques, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions a user study, which involves computer vision techniques, making cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
