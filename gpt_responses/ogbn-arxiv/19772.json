The paper situates its analysis in the wider political economy of emotional AI and the history of deception detection technologies, which aligns with the scope of the cs.CY sub-category.\n\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the design and assumptions of iBorderCtrl, a border control system that uses facial recognition technology and micro-expressions to detect deception. The paper also highlights the statistical fallacies in the foundational premise of mass screening. These topics are relevant to the cs.CR sub-category, which deals with cryptography and security in computer systems.\n\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of emotional AI and deception detection technologies in iBorderCtrl. The paper also critiques the scientific validation and assumptions underpinning the project design. These topics align with the scope of the cs.AI sub-category, which deals with artificial intelligence and its applications.\n\n4. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the implications of iBorderCtrl on the creation of subjects and management of populations. The paper also questions the function of data-driven systems and emotional AI in particular. These topics align with the scope of the cs.HC sub-category, which deals"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
