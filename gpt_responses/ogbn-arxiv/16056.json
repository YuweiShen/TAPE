The focus is on incentive schemes to induce selfish users to transmit at desired power levels, which involves game theory (cs.GT). The paper also discusses the use of intervention devices to monitor and control power levels, which involves information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper proposes a dynamic adjustment process to guide users and the intervention device to the desired outcome, which involves control theory (cs.MA).
