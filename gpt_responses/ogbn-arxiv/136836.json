The method uses a robust policy gradient algorithm, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of computer vision for obstacle detection and avoidance (cs.CV). The navigation policy is optimized for safety, which involves control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
