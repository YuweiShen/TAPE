The paper also mentions the interleaving distance, which is a measure of similarity between topological spaces, and is relevant to computational topology (cs.GT) and applied algebraic topology (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses dynamic programming techniques, which are commonly used in algorithms for discrete optimization (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
