OCR is a subfield of computer vision (cs.CV) that deals with the recognition of printed or handwritten text characters. The paper also involves statistical analysis (cs.IR) of the image to predict the word failure rate of OCR. The use of a standard OCR engine (Adobe Capture) involves deep learning (cs.DL) techniques. The paper also involves machine learning (cs.LG) techniques to predict the number of OCR errors. Finally, the paper deals with natural language processing (cs.CL) as it involves the recognition of text characters."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
