The use of descriptive sentences for weakly-supervised learning suggests a connection to natural language processing (cs.CL). The proposed deep architecture and training method involve neural networks and optimization, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also mentions the creation of a new dataset for scene parsing, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
