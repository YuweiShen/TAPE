Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.WEB (Web Technologies). Additionally, the paper discusses the expansion of macros in historical article revisions, which involves computational linguistics and natural language processing, making cs.CL (Computation and Language) another likely sub-category.
