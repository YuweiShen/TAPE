The paper proposes a novel two-step learning algorithm for solving the full and almost full cold start problems in dyadic prediction. The paper also compares the proposed method with existing tensor product kernel methods and shows that the proposed method yields slightly better predictive performance. Given the focus on machine learning and prediction, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.CV (Computer Vision), as these sub-categories also deal with machine learning and prediction problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
