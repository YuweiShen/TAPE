Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel approach for adaptive sharing, which involves learning a task-specific policy for selectively choosing which layers to execute for a given task. This suggests that the paper may also belong to categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on benchmark datasets, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
