The paper also discusses the trade-offs between undetected error probability and erasure probability, which is a topic related to coding theory (cs.CC). The use of low complexity successive cancellation decoder with erasure is a topic related to signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also involves the analysis of binary memoryless symmetric channels, which is a topic related to network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the paper involves mathematical derivations and analysis, which is a topic related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
