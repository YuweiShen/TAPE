The paper also involves building models to predict optimal transfer languages, which falls under the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of features such as phylogenetic similarity, typological properties, lexical overlap, and size of available data to select transfer languages also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the experiments on NLP tasks may involve computer vision techniques, leading to a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
