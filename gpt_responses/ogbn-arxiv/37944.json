It also involves computations and algorithms, which could fall under cryptography and security (cs.CR) or numerical analysis (cs.NA). The use of cyclotomic cosets and double circulant codes suggests a connection to algebraic combinatorics (cs.DM) and coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
