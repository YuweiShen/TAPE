The tasks evaluated in the paper include scene categorization, multi-label image annotation, and semantic segmentation, which are all related to computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed method involves adding separate network modules to the intermediate layers of a pre-trained convolutional network, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions exploiting external label taxonomy, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses the computational cost of training and inference, which is a topic related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
