The use of Haskell as the programming language indicates a focus on functional programming (cs.PL) and the use of mathematical structures suggests a focus on logic in computer science (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper's emphasis on simulations and experiments suggests a focus on educational technology (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
