The proposed method is specifically designed for social event detection, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of machine learning algorithms for image classification also relates to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
