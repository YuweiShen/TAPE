The paper specifically focuses on using statistical data generated by CICFlowMeter, which is a network intrusion detection system, and applying machine learning models to detect Zero-Day attacks. Therefore, machine learning (cs.LG) and network security (cs.NI) are also likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves evaluating the performance of different classification models, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
