This falls under computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also uses techniques from computational complexity (cs.CC) and combinatorics (cs.DM) to prove lower bounds. Finally, the paper examines realistic input assumptions, which could fall under cs.CC or cs.DM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
