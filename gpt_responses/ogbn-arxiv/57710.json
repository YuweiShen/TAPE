Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers topics related to natural language processing and computational linguistics. The paper also proposes a new structure for NMT, which involves designing specific masks for self-attention network and introducing a squeeze gate for fusion. These aspects suggest that the paper could also be relevant to categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed framework on three machine translation tasks, which could make it relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as well, since machine translation involves processing visual information such as text."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
