The paper also discusses the use of logits, which are commonly used in neural networks, further supporting the likelihood of the paper belonging to these sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of non-parametric methods, which are commonly used in the sub-field of computational statistics (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the use of different datasets and architectures, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-field of neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
