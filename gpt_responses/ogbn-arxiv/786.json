The paper proposes a framework that aims to recognize recurring concepts and reuse a classifier trained previously, which involves meta-learning and adaptation, falling under \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). The paper also deals with the problem of concept drift, which is a common issue in data streams and falls under \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS). The paper uses synthetic and real-world datasets, which may involve computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
