The paper proposes two spectral angle based approaches for spatial-spectral classification. The most relevant sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV) as it deals with image classification. The paper also uses machine learning techniques such as support vector machines and Gaussian processes, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with information retrieval (cs.IR) as it involves classification of hyperspectral images. Finally, the paper involves graph theory and optimization (cs.GR) as it uses Markov random fields for classification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
