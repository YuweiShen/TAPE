Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also proposes a framework that leverages machine learning techniques to detect and prevent DDoS attacks, which suggests the sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of DDoS attacks on the security of IoT devices, which could be classified under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper proposes the use of mobile edge computing (MEC) to enhance the security of IoT networks, which could be categorized under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
