The paper also focuses on the development of a secure cryptographic library, which involves software engineering practices (cs.SE) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The use of enclaves to store keys and perform computation on temporary buffers also involves programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). Finally, the implementation of hashes and symmetric encryption algorithms falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
