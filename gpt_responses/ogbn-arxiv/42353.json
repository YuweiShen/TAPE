The use of emergency stops (e-stops) is a mechanism for controlling the exploration of the state space, which is relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
