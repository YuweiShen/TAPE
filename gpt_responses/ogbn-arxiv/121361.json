The use of SMDP algorithms for computing the value function over concurrent options suggests a focus on robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The factored state space models and the use of options framework also suggest a potential fit with the machine learning sub-category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
