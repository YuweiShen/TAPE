The paper proposes a new approach for cascade object detection using chained deep features and classifiers, which involves learning the features and classifiers jointly in an end-to-end network. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) categories. Additionally, the paper evaluates its approach on benchmarks like PASCAL VOC 2007 and ImageNet, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
