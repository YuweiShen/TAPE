The paper proposes a method for searching for proper interaction functions in collaborative filtering tasks, which involves designing an expressive search space and using a structured multi-layer perceptron to represent the search space. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
