The paper also extensively uses deep neural networks (DNN), which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the unsupervised learning of inter-dependencies between the outputs, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on two public datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
