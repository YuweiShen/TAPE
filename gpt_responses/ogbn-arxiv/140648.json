It also involves the concept of secrecy and security, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The use of a secret key for achieving covert communication suggests a possible connection to multimedia security (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the role of channel state information (CSI) in achieving covert communication, which is relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
