This involves the use of optimization techniques, which are commonly used in computational engineering.\n- cs.ME (Mechanical Engineering): The paper focuses on enhancing the structural performance of additively manufactured objects, which is a key concern in mechanical engineering. The proposed methods involve optimizing the shape and build orientation of the objects to meet structural constraints.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): Although the paper does not explicitly mention robotics, the use of optimization techniques to improve the performance of additively manufactured objects is relevant to robotics. Robots often require lightweight and structurally robust components, which can be achieved through additive manufacturing and optimization.\n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper discusses the use of data-driven shape optimization approaches, which may involve discrete mathematics techniques such as graph theory or combinatorial optimization.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The optimization methods proposed in the paper aim to maximize the structural performance of additively manufactured objects while satisfying geometrical and cost constraints. This can be seen as a control problem, where the objective is to find the optimal design that meets certain specifications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
