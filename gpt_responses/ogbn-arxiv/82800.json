The approach involves the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and focuses on reducing computational complexity and storage requirements. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper involves the use of deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with video processing, which could place it in the cs.MM (Multimedia) category. Finally, the paper's focus on aerial videos suggests that it could also belong to the cs.RO (Robotics) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
