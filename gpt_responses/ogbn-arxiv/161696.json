The use of a recurrent neural network also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. Additionally, the proposed method involves designing a principled loss function, which could place it in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. The occlusion handling aspect of the model could also suggest the Robotics (cs.RO) category. Finally, the use of neural networks for segmentation could also place it in the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
