This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also discusses the replication of code symbols, which is a topic related to data structures (cs.DS). The repair-by-transfer and help-by-transfer techniques mentioned in the paper are used in network coding (cs.NI) and distributed computing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents techniques for converting an arbitrary MBR code to one with double replication, which could be considered a type of code optimization (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
