The focus on error-tolerance and noise in quantum computing suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of emerging technologies (cs.ET). The use of smoothing techniques to mitigate physical noise effects suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and cryptography (cs.CR), specifically LPN algorithms. Finally, the mention of statistical distributions and quantum advantage suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
