The use of convolutional neural networks also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the proposed system involves the estimation of a medium transmission map, which could fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of established assumptions/priors in image dehazing suggests that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the use of benchmark images and the focus on image processing suggest that it may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
