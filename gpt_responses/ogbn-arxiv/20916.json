The paper also discusses the design of robust broadcasting schemes, which involves optimization and control aspects, making it relevant to the sub-categories of networked systems (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of computationally-efficient design formulations, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
