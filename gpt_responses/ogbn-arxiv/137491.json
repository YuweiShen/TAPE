The paper proposes a streamlined algorithm that improves sample efficiency and performance, which are key concerns in the robotics and control systems communities. The paper also discusses normalization and sampling techniques, which are relevant to computer vision and machine learning applications. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.RO, cs.SY, and cs.CV, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
