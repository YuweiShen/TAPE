The use of R\\'enyi divergence and mutual information also suggests a connection to cs.ITP (Information Theory and Probability). The analysis of asymptotics and the use of probabilistic techniques may also make this paper relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the focus on redundancy and capacity in information theory may also make this paper relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
