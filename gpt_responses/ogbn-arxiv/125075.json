The authors also use NeuroEvolution, which is a subfield of neural networks and evolutionary algorithms (cs.NE). The use of CNNs implies the analysis of images, which is related to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of gamma/hadron discrimination, which is a topic in cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
