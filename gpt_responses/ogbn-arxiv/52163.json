This problem is closely related to information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP), which are subfields of computer science. Therefore, cs.IR and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a platform that uses AI to label terms precisely, which falls under the scope of AI and machine learning (cs.AI), as well as deep learning (cs.LG) and deep neural networks (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
