This is a core topic in systems and control.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper describes a decision procedure for probabilistic bounded reachability problems, which involves logical reasoning and optimization. This is a key area of research in logic in computer science.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new tool for solving reachability problems for stochastic hybrid systems, which is a relevant application of artificial intelligence techniques.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper describes an approach that encodes stochastic information using random variables, which is related to probabilistic programming and could be of interest to the programming languages community.\n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper presents a new tool, SReach, for solving probabilistic bounded reachability problems, which involves numerical methods and optimization.
