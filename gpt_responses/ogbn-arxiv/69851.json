Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with reinforcement learning, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The use of potential-based shaping rewards is related to control theory, which is covered by cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper discusses real-time learning, which is relevant to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
