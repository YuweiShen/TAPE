Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which focuses on NLP and related topics. The paper also discusses the labeling framework and annotation workflow, which involves machine learning and data analysis, indicating a possible fit with cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the use of dependency trees to represent discourse structure suggests a connection to cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which deals with the organization and retrieval of textual data. Finally, the domain-specific nature of the treebank and the focus on scientific articles may relate to cs.CY (Computers and Society), which covers the social and ethical implications of computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
