The paper also proposes a new approach to defend against Sybil devices based on proximity graphs, which involves data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) as well as network infrastructure (cs.NI). The use of co-location edges and proximity graphs also involves the analysis of spatial data (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the potential impact of attacks on crowdsourced mapping services, which falls under the category of cyber-physical systems (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
