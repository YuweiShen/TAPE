This involves the development of new software tools and techniques for solving complex mathematical problems, which falls under the scope of mathematical software.\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper focuses on the development of efficient solvers for the saddle-point and elliptic systems arising from discontinuous Galerkin and mixed finite element methods. This involves the use of numerical analysis techniques for solving partial differential equations, which is a key area of research in numerical analysis.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the application of hybridized solvers to geophysical fluid dynamics, which is a field of computational science and engineering. The development of efficient solvers for complex models is also relevant to other areas of computational science and engineering.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the implementation of hybridization and static condensation as runtime-configurable preconditioners via the Python interface to PETSc, which is a parallel computing library.
