Specifically, it proposes a method for training networks that can resist large variations between training and testing data. This topic is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG), as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) applications. Therefore, these five sub-categories are the most likely candidates for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
