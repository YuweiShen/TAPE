The paper proposes a novel decoding approach for NMT based on continuous optimization, which involves converting decoding from a discrete optimization problem to a continuous optimization problem. This approach is based on gradient-based methods, which are commonly used in machine learning and optimization, and can be applied to a wide range of NMT models, including bidirectional and bilingual models. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (NLP) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves optimization techniques, which are also relevant to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision), as NMT can be applied to image captioning and other visual tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
