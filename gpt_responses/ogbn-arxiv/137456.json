Therefore, cs.SY is a possible sub-category.\n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper proposes a cooperative computing scheme where mobile devices can offload computation tasks to nearby devices, which involves distributed computing concepts. Hence, cs.DC is a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper presents simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, which involves multimedia data transmission and processing. Therefore, cs.MM is a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
