Additionally, the use of controllers based on force fields and action sequences suggests that it may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. The fact that the controllers are for a robotic task also suggests that it may belong to the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category.
