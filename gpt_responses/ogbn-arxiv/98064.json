The use of linear filters and interference alignment concepts also suggests a focus on networking and communication (cs.NI). The paper also employs tools from signal processing (cs.SI) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with the design of transmission schemes, which could fall under the category of computer networks and communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
