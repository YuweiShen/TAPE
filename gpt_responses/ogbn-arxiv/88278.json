This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel approach that leverages the abstraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the impact of different amounts of training data and different data dimensionality, which are topics of interest in neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
