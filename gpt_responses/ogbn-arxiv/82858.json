The paper proposes a generalization of the classical Bregman divergence and the gradient of mutual information for scalar and vector Poisson and Gaussian channel models. These concepts are relevant to several subfields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), signal processing (cs.SI), computer vision (cs.CV), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
