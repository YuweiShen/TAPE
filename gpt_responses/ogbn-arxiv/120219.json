The use of gradient-based algorithms also suggests a possible fit with cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also deals with the optimization of Boolean circuits, which is a topic that falls under cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Additionally, the paper discusses the role of local correlation in learning, which is a topic that could be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
