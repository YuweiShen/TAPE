The paper also proposes an optimal test based on likelihood ratio, which is a common tool in information theory. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with distributed detection in a sensor network, which is a classic problem in systems and control. The paper also characterizes the error exponent, which is a common tool in control theory. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper deals with decision rules and error exponents, which are common topics in machine learning. The paper also proposes an optimal test based on mixture likelihood ratio, which is a common tool in statistical learning. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper deals with distributed detection in a sensor network, which is a classic problem in distributed algorithms.
