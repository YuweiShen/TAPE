This falls under the category of game theory (cs.GT) as it involves strategic decision-making by multiple actors. The paper also proposes evaluation criteria and bribery methods, which can be seen as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The analysis of the problems of lobbying in a stochastic environment involves computational complexity theory (cs.CC) and parameterized complexity (cs.DS). Finally, the paper provides approximability and inapproximability results, which can be seen as optimization problems in computer science (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
