It discusses the use of forward-translation and back-translation, and the effects of domains, translationese, and noise on the performance of these methods. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
