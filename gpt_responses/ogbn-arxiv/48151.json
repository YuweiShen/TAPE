The case study also involves a quadrotor attitude system, which is an example of an embedded system. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses digital controllers used in a quadrotor attitude system, which falls under the domain of systems and control. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper mentions the use of MATLAB, which is a programming language and environment commonly used in scientific computing. The tool presented in the paper is also implemented in MATLAB. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a tool for automated counterexample reproducibility, which can be seen as a software engineering problem. The tool is also based on model checking, which is a software engineering technique. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper mentions the use of satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), which is a logical framework used in automated reasoning. The DSVerifier tool, which is used to generate counterexamples, is also based on SMT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
