The title explicitly mentions \"quantum\" and \"interactive proofs\", which are both subfields of quantum information (cs.QI). The paper also discusses an efficient algorithm for solving semidefinite programs, which is a topic in optimization and algorithms (cs.DS). The multiplicative weights update method used in the algorithm is a technique commonly used in information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
