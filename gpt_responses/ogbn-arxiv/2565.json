The use of deep learning also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of microcontrollers for executing the learned policies, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper uses computer vision techniques to detect and navigate towards a light source, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
