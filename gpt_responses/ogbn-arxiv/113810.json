Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques to extract relevant information from the book, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another likely category. The paper proposes new methods based on hidden Markov models, which are commonly used in machine learning and statistical modeling, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely categories as well. Finally, the paper also mentions gains on an extractive book summarization task, which involves deep learning techniques, making cs.DL (Deep Learning) a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
