The paper proposes approximation algorithms for top-list aggregation, which is a generalization of the well-known rank aggregation problem. The algorithms proposed in the paper are based on concepts from data structures (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), and social networks (cs.SI). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DS, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.SI, and cs.IT, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
