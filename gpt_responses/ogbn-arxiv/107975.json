The use of stacking operations and the analysis of the coordinates suggest that the paper may also belong to the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and data structures (cs.DS) categories. The study of polytopes and their properties is also relevant to the field of graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the use of algorithms and computational techniques to compute the realization of the polytopes suggests that the paper may also belong to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
