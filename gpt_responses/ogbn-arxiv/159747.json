The paper also discusses the choice of metrics and prox function, which are common topics in information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed method is applied to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) categories. Finally, the paper discusses the potential impact of the proposed method on MRI reconstruction, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
