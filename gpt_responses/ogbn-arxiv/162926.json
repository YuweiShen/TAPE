This problem is related to several areas of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), game theory (cs.GT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), systems and control (cs.SY), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper proposes a network-assisted distributed channel selection approach based on a multi-player multi-armed bandit game with side information, which involves a combination of no-regret learning and calibrated forecasting. This approach can be applied to a broad class of multi-player stochastic learning problems, in addition to the formulated channel selection problem. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT, cs.GT, cs.NI, cs.SY, and cs.LG, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
