The proposed frameworks and techniques also involve machine learning and deep learning methods (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper deals with semantic segmentation and action recognition, which are sub-fields of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also mentions real-time inference and occlusion-aware estimation, which are relevant to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
