The paper also reviews the state-of-the-art proximity verification techniques that make use of contextual information, which can be considered as a subfield of signal processing (cs.SI) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the challenges and possible future solutions for detecting co-presence between devices, which can be related to the fields of cyber-physical systems (cs.CY) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
