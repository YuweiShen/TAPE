Specifically, it introduces a quantitative extension of Strategy Logic (SL) and demonstrates its applications in multi-agent systems. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), cs.FL (Fuzzy Logic), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
