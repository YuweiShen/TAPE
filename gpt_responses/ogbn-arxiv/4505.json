The paper also proposes an approximation for the average information leakage rate, which involves optimization of transmission rates, indicating the involvement of networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of numerical simulations, which suggests the involvement of multimedia (cs.MM) in the research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
