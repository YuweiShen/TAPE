The study also involves evaluating the generalization behaviors of RL agents, which could be relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of neural networks, which could relate to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
