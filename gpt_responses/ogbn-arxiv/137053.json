Therefore, the most likely category is cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also focuses on improving the robustness of the abstract domains against program transformations, which suggests the category cs.SE (Software Engineering). The paper deals with symbolic methods, which could fall under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper mentions the Astr\\'{e}e static analyzer, which is a tool for analyzing embedded critical avionics software, indicating a possible fit with cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
