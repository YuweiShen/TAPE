It may also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category as it evaluates three benchmark applications in Canary on up to 64 servers and 1,152 cores on Amazon EC2. Additionally, it may belong to the Databases (cs.DB) sub-category as it discusses data partitioning and scheduling tasks based on data partitions. It may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category as it presents a new approach to scheduling that reverses the responsibilities between controllers and workers. Finally, it may belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category as it discusses the scheduling of tasks and the optimization of jobs running on thousands of cores."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
