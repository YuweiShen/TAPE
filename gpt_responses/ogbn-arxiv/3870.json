However, the focus on referring expression comprehension and the use of visual properties make it most likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories. The use of reasoning logics and the evaluation of state-of-the-art models also suggest that it could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the use of hard mining strategy and the potential for deeper analysis suggest that it could also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
