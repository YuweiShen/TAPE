The paper discusses the use of meta-features and meta-classifiers to estimate the competence of each classifier in a pool and select the most competent ones. This work is related to machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, data mining, and neural networks, which are all sub-categories of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.DM (Data Mining), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
