The paper specifically focuses on the use of refinement types, which are a type of static type system, indicating a possible fit with programming languages (cs.PL) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). The application of the tool to cognitive neuroscience suggests a potential fit with artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
