This falls under the scope of computational engineering and science. \n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper employs a high-performance computing framework that couples a specialized parallel finite-element software with Dakota for parametric exploration. This falls under the scope of mathematical software. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper deals with numerical modelling of heat transfer in powder bed fusion, which involves solving partial differential equations using numerical methods. This falls under the scope of numerical analysis. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): This category is less likely, but the paper does include some figures and diagrams to illustrate the results of the computational experiments. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): This category is also less likely, but the paper does describe the software framework used for the simulations and parameter estimation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
