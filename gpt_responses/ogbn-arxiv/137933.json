The paper focuses on the performance analysis of the system in terms of delivery latency, which suggests that it falls under the category of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). The use of network coding techniques for fronthauling and edge caching also indicates that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-categories. The system involves the use of a control unit (CU) and distributed edge nodes (ENs), which suggests that it may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the optimization of multi-connectivity transmission, which may indicate that it belongs to the Architecture (cs.AR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
