Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves game theory (cs.GT) and algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) in solving the bribery problem. The authors use polynomial time algorithms, which suggests that the paper may also fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
