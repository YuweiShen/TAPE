This falls under the sub-category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR) which deals with the organization, representation, storage, retrieval, and dissemination of information. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of clustering and keyword models, which are common techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). The evaluation of different active learning strategies also involves machine learning techniques such as classification and regression (cs.LG). The paper also touches on the potential impact of active learning on legal practice, which could fall under the sub-categories of Cybersecurity (cs.CY) or Cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
