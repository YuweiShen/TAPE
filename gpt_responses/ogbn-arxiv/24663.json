The paper also introduces novel optimization techniques for outlier detection and radio map interpolation, which are related to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT). The use of similarity-based grouping of reference points and sparse recovery techniques for radio map interpolation also involves signal processing and image analysis (cs.SI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI, followed by cs.LG, cs.IT, cs.SI, and cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
