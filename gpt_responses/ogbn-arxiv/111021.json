The focus on visual analysis and interaction suggests a strong connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use cases mentioned in the abstract, such as understanding corpora differences and algorithmic differences in generating embeddings, suggest a connection to computational linguistics (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
