It also mentions the use of optimization techniques to improve the performance of the model, which is a common theme in machine learning research.\n\nAdditionally, the paper involves the use of neural networks, which is a common technique in the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The use of deep learning architectures for survival analysis is also a relatively new area of research, which may be of interest to researchers in these sub-categories.\n\nThe paper also mentions the use of metrics to evaluate the performance of the model, which is a common theme in the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks).
