The analytical tools mentioned in the paper, such as smoothness-type inequalities and extension theorems, are also relevant to the fields of data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the equilibria of widely-used auction formats, which is a topic that falls under the field of computational economics (cs.EC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
