The paper also proposes a novel ray-based field probing technique and a geometric regularizer, which are both related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of precise geometric properties and control, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
