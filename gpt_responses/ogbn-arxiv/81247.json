Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves optimization and algorithm design, which could fall under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with system-level optimization and control, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper proposes a low-complexity algorithm, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
