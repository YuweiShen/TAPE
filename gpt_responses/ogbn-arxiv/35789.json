The focus of the paper is on the implementation of digital circuits, which is related to the sub-category of Architecture (cs.AR). The use of reversible logic blocks for design and implementation is a key aspect of the paper, which is related to the sub-category of Digital Circuits (cs.DC). The development of new algorithms for Truth Table generation and symmetry analysis is related to the sub-category of Programming Languages (cs.PL). Finally, the use of a GUI-based simulator and the emphasis on user-friendliness is related to the sub-category of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
