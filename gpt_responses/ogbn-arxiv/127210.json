The use of minimum mean-squared error estimator and Gaussian input distribution suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.MM). The mention of Bussgang's decomposition also indicates a possible connection to statistical learning theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
