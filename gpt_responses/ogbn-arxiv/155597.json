However, the focus on adversarial training and the specific issue of robustness against perturbations in $\\ell_2$ and $\\ell_\\infty$ norms suggests that the paper is most likely to belong to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses limitations and possible solutions, which could suggest the sub-categories of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) or Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
