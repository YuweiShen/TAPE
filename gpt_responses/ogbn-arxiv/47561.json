The paper also discusses the weaknesses of current defenses and proposes a new class of obfuscation algorithms, which involves software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL). The proposed algorithms are designed to hinder Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE), which involves symbolic reasoning (cs.LG) and system engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
