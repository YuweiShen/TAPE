This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Communications (cs.COMM), and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper characterizes the limits of reliable information rates and compares the proposed method with a theoretical decoder, which indicates that it may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
