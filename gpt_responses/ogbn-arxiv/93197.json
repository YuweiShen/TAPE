The paper focuses on the theoretical analysis of the algorithm and establishes guarantees on the size and accuracy of the resulting compressed network. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also introduces a novel notion of sensitivity and extends traditional coreset constructions, which suggests a possible fit with cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
