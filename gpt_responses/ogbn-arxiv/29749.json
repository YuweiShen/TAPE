This involves exploring constituent molecular and material 'building blocks', as well as their possible assemblies into specialised morphological and sensorimotor configurations. The paper also highlights the main roadblocks and how they may be overcome, and shows robotic applications to which MLE is particularly suited. This work is highly relevant to the fields of robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), systems and control (cs.SY), machine learning (cs.MA), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
