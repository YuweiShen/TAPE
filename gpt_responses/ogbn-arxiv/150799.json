Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also focuses on learning discrete hash code and explores complementary information from multiple views, which suggests the category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with large-scale data analysis and storage, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper proposes a strategy of automatically assigning weights for each view to better guide the clustering, which could be related to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
