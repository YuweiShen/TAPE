The paper also extensively uses deep learning techniques, which are commonly studied in the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) subfields. The development of the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) architecture involves the use of lateral connections, which are a type of neural network architecture commonly studied in the neural networks (cs.NE) subfield. Finally, the paper discusses the practical implementation of the FPN architecture, which involves optimizing for speed and efficiency, making it relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) subfield."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
