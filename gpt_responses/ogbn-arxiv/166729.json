The paper discusses the analysis process and the identification of structural properties and regularities in the change-logs of such projects. The paper also demonstrates the practical usefulness of the extracted Markov chains for user-interface designers, ontology-engineering tool developers, and project-managers. Given the focus on collaborative ontology-engineering projects and the use of Markov chains for modeling sequential patterns, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.DB (Databases), cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
