The paper proposes a framework that combines a large set of weakly supervised images with a small set of fully supervised images to train the segmentation model. This work is primarily focused on computer vision (CV) and machine learning (LG) techniques for image segmentation. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of self-correction modules, which are a form of artificial intelligence (AI) and multimedia (MM) techniques. Finally, the paper uses neural networks (NE) to train the models. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.AI, cs.MM, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
