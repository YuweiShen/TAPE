The use of optoelectronics and photon-based learning rules also suggests a possible connection to the fields of electronics and photonics (cs.ET and cs.EM). The circuits designed for supervised and unsupervised learning may also involve computational complexity (cs.CC) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
