Additionally, the paper mentions the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for this task, which is a common technique in computer vision. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of sophisticated network architecture, which suggests that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. \n\nThe focus on improving performance through network architecture suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. \n\nThe use of DNNs also suggests that it may belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the evaluation of the computational cost of the approach suggests that it may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category, as this is a common concern in multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
