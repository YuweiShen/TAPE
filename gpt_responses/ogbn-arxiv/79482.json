The proposed method involves adapting an objectness measure using machine learning techniques, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The method also involves integrating objectness into tracking algorithms, which relates to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on a benchmark dataset, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
