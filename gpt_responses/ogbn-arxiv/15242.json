The method also handles side information and can be used for data-driven representation learning, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper applies the method to image data (CelebA) to identify archetypal faces, which is a common task in computer vision (cs.CV). The method is also motivated by studies in biology, which could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions the potential for the method to be used in de novo molecular design, which could fall under the category of computational chemistry (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
