This falls under the domain of game theory, making cs.GT the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a descending price algorithm to determine market clearing prices. This falls under the domain of algorithms, making cs.DS a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with a matching market and proposes an auction mechanism to determine market clearing prices. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an auction mechanism to determine market clearing prices. This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper specializes to the rank one valuations in sponsored search markets and provides an alternate characterization of the set of all market clearing prices.
