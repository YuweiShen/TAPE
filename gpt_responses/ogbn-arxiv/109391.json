The paper also discusses the use of feedback and channel state information, which are topics in networked systems and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper uses mathematical analysis and proofs to derive its results, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the application of its results to multiple access channels, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
