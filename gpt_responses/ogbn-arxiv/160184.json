The proposed modifications to the flipping function and flipped bit selection rule involve tracking the evolutions of check and variable nodes' reliabilities, which could be related to network information theory (cs.NI) or social and information networks (cs.SI). The paper also discusses selective weight-updating schedules, which could be related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) or control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
