The proposed method involves using deep networks to generate pseudo-labels, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The paper also mentions self-supervision, which is a technique used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of multiple networks to represent multiple saliency methods is a form of ensemble learning, which is a subfield of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with image retrieval and ranking, which is a topic in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
