The use of deep learning models for this task also suggests the likelihood of the paper belonging to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The creation of a new dataset and the evaluation of results also suggest the possibility of the paper belonging to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The concept of \"in the wild\" emotions recognition and the use of online sources for data collection suggest the possibility of the paper belonging to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the use of regression GANs for predicting valence and arousal values suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
