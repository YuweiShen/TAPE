Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also uses computer graphics techniques to build eye-region models, which suggests a possible fit with cs.GR (Graphics). Additionally, the paper discusses the importance of realistic illumination and shape variations in eye-region training data, which could relate to cs.GT (Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design). The paper also mentions the potential applications of their method in human-computer interaction, which could fall under cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). Finally, the paper evaluates their method's performance on cross-dataset appearance-based gaze estimation, which could be relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
