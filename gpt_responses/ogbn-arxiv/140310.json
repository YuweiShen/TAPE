The paper also explores the edge-connectivity of a graph, which is a fundamental concept in graph theory and falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper discusses the use of static routing schemes, which are commonly used in distributed computing and fall under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the use of packet-duplication and packet-header-rewriting, which are techniques used in information theory and fall under the category of information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses the resiliency of routing schemes, which is a topic that falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
