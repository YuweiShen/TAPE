The paper also proposes a new code construction, which involves parallel coding and splitting, making it relevant to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper's focus on achieving optimal performance in a specific type of channel could also make it relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
