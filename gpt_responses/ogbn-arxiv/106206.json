The paper proposes robust estimators that achieve optimal error guarantees and efficient running times. This makes it relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), statistics (cs.ST), and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
