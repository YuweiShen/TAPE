The paper also addresses the practicality and scalability of transmitter cooperation approaches, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the allocation of feedback to transmitters, which could fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) or machine learning (cs.LG) depending on the specific techniques used."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
