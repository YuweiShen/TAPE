The proposed method uses convolutional neural networks (cs.CV) to predict the robustness of a grasp and a distribution of post-grasp object displacements. The use of neural networks also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the method is designed for industrial applications, which often involve control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
