This falls under the domain of machine learning and hence, cs.LG is a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - Word embeddings are widely used in various AI applications such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. Hence, cs.AI is another likely sub-category.\n4. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - Although the paper does not explicitly deal with computer vision, Gaussian embeddings have been used in image processing and computer vision tasks. Hence, cs.CV is a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) - The paper proposes a neural network-based approach for learning Gaussian embeddings.
