The model, called D numbers, is a modification of the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, which falls under the category of decision theory and game theory (cs.DS). The paper proposes new combination rules for D numbers, which involves information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI) concepts such as conflict redistribution. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI and cs.LG, followed by cs.DS, cs.IT, and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
