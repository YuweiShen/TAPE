The paper studies tradeoffs between the number of processors, the number of rounds of communication, and the per-processor load required to compute the query, which are fundamental issues in distributed computing. The paper also uses MapReduce, a popular distributed computing framework, to design structured algorithms for the problem. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DB (Databases), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), and cs.Distributed (Distributed Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
