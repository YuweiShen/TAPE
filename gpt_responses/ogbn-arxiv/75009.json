The paper discusses the use of machine learning techniques to learn the statistical significance of patterns of events from past attacks and to compose these patterns into Factor Graphs (FGs) to capture the progression of the attack. The paper also evaluates the accuracy and performance of the proposed framework in three experiments. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
