The paper proposes an extended architecture for ASP systems, which can improve the efficiency of ASP in solving hard combinatorial problems. \n\n2. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses an extended architecture for ASP systems, which involves partial compilation of input programs. This is a topic related to logic in computer science. \n\n3. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper proposes a new approach for implementing ASP systems, which involves compiling parts of the input program into an ad-hoc evaluation algorithm. This is a topic related to programming languages. \n\n4. cs.DB (Databases): The paper mentions that ASP has been applied in deductive databases applications. The proposed approach for partial compilation of ASP programs can improve the efficiency of such applications. \n\n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents an implementation of the proposed approach on top of a well-known ASP solver and conducts an experimental analysis on publicly-available benchmarks. This is a topic related to software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
