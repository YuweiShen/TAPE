The paper introduces and develops the theory of promonoidal categories, which is a subfield of category theory that has applications in computer science and programming language theory. The paper also discusses the use of monoidal bicategories and pseudomonoids, which are topics in category theory that have applications in computer science and mathematical physics. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.CT (Computational Topology), cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
