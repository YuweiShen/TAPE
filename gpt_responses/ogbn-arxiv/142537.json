This falls under the domain of signal processing, making cs.SI the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Nonnegative matrix factorization is a popular technique in machine learning, and the paper proposes an algorithm for convolutive nonnegative matrix factorization. This makes cs.LG a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.SD (Sound): The paper deals with audio source separation, which falls under the domain of sound. This makes cs.SD a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an algorithm for convolutive nonnegative matrix factorization, which can be used in a number of applications such as neural sequence identification. This falls under the domain of systems and control, making cs.SY a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper deals with neural sequence identification, which falls under the domain of neural computing.
