The paper also analyzes the effect of impairments on large-scale MIMO systems, which falls under the category of system and control (cs.SY). The use of multiple antennas in MIMO systems is also related to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of impairments on the performance of traditional MIMO systems, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
