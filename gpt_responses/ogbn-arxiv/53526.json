The paper also discusses the use of the proposed architecture in a stochastic environment, which relates to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed architecture on Atari games, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV) as it involves processing visual input."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
