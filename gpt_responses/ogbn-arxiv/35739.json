The use of locally dense lattices and sparsification techniques suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also discusses the hardness of the problem, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
