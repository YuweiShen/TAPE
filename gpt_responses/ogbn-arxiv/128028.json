This places the paper in the area of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the modular structure of ELPs, which falls under the area of Programming Languages (cs.PL). The investigation of computational complexity places the paper in the area of Computational Complexity (cs.CC), and the use of solvers for ELPs suggests the area of Computation and Language (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
