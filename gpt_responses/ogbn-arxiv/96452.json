The proposed method involves introducing historical views in training to improve the model's robustness, which can be considered as a form of memory-based learning (LG). The paper also proposes a novel rapid compressed context learning to increase the discriminative ability of the filter, which involves machine learning (MM) and artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.RO, cs.LG, cs.MM, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
