Additionally, the paper mentions language modeling and natural language inference (NLI), which are common techniques in NLP research. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of machine learning models for these tasks, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nFurthermore, the paper explores the effects of syntactic knowledge on function word comprehension, which could place it in the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as syntactic knowledge is a key component of many AI systems. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of sentence encoders, which could place it in the sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as neural networks are commonly used for encoding sentences. \n\nFinally, the paper could potentially belong to the sub-category cs.CV (Computer Vision) as it discusses the use of probing tasks to test for understanding of specific types of function words, which is similar to the use of probing tasks in computer vision research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
