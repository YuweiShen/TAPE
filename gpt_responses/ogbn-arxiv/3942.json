This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) as it involves designing efficient coding schemes to minimize the number of tests required for identification. The paper also involves analyzing the sample complexity of the number of tests required for guaranteed recovery, which is related to the fields of data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The proposed algorithm also involves probabilistic decoding, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
