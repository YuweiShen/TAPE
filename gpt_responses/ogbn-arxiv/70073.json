The use of Reed-Solomon codes and subspace alignment suggests a focus on information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR). The analysis of capacity and the dependence on field size suggest a focus on data structures (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB). Finally, the consideration of symmetric security constraints suggests a focus on complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
