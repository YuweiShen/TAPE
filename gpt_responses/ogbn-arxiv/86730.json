The proposed receiver architecture and coding schemes involve adaptive threshold one-bit ADCs, which may also fall under the categories of networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of MIMO channels and coding schemes for point-to-point and broadcast channels may also relate to multimedia (cs.MM) and communication (cs.COM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
