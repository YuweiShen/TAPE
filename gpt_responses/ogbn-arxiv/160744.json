Therefore, the most likely category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques such as Curriculum Learning, Double Networks Mechanism, and Winning Value Decay, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper involves image recognition techniques for analyzing the game board, which could place it in the cs.CV (Computer Vision) category. Finally, the paper involves game theory and strategy, which could place it in the cs.GT (Game Theory) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
