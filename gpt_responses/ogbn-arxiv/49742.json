This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) categories. The use of transfer learning and multi-task learning also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves the analysis of large datasets, which could also fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
