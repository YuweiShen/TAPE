The proposed method involves training a sequence of detectors with increasing IoU thresholds, which requires machine learning techniques (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper also discusses the problem of overfitting during training and inference-time mismatch, which are common issues in robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the experiments involve evaluating the method on the COCO dataset, which is a popular benchmark in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
