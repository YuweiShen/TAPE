The proposed method is based on random Fourier features and provides a data-driven weighting strategy for these features. The paper also presents an efficient randomized algorithm for large-scale applications. Given these aspects, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
