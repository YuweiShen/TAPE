It could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) as it involves natural language processing and speech recognition. The use of deep neural networks suggests it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the focus on adversarial attacks suggests it could also belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
