The focus on modular composition and simulation suggests a connection to multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and systems and control (cs.SY). The use of DEVS for performance analysis suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the discussion of shortcomings and variants of the DEVS formalism suggests a connection to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
