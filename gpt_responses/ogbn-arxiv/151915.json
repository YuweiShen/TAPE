The paper proposes two new loss functions and a temporal network, which are all related to machine learning (cs.LG). The use of 3D data and the analysis of loss surfaces suggest a connection to robotics (cs.RO). The paper also mentions weakly-supervised learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves the estimation of human body structures, which could be considered a topic in computer graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
