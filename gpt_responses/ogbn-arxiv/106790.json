The paper discusses the use of a multinomial logistic regression model trained with a variety of features to detect paraphrases. This work involves natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning, which are all subfields of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
