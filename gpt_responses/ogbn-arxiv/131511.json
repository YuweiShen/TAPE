The proposed scheme involves image processing and Fourier domain representation, which are common in computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. The use of low-rank approximation and minimum spanning tree also suggests a possible connection to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
