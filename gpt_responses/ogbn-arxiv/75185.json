Therefore, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves combinatorial aspects of self-assembly, which suggests cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) as likely sub-categories. The use of nondeterminism in tile systems and its effect on the resources required for molecular shape-building algorithms relates to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry), respectively, making them also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
