Additionally, the paper focuses on recognizing facial expressions in a difficult setting with severe occlusions, which is relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and multimedia (cs.MM). The use of intentionally occluded training examples to improve accuracy also involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
