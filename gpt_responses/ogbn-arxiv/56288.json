This involves the use of Web technologies and the creation of a panel of eligible experiment participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Therefore, the most likely category is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of VR devices and reproducing VR illusions, which suggests Graphics (cs.GR) as another likely category. \n\nThe paper also mentions challenges related to scale and the potential for low-cost replicable experiments, which could fall under Cybersecurity (cs.CYBER) and Computer Engineering (cs.CE), respectively. \n\nFinally, the paper mentions the use of VR in experiments, which could also fall under Computer Vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
