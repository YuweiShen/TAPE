The paper specifically focuses on parameter servers, which are commonly used in distributed training, and proposes a new approach for dynamic parameter allocation. This topic is closely related to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and data structures (cs.DS), as efficient parameter management is crucial for achieving good performance in large-scale machine learning tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
