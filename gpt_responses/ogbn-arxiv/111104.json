This involves the use of probabilistic inference and Bayesian statistics for likelihood-free inference. The paper also discusses the use of modern simulators and recent techniques in Bayesian statistics. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
