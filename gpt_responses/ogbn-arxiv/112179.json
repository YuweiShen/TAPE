It also discusses compression rates and probability bounds, which are related to coding theory (cs.CC). The use of side information and the conversion of universal lossless codes suggest a connection to source coding (cs.SI). The analysis of stationary, ergodic sources and the use of belief propagation decoding suggest a connection to statistical inference (cs.DS). Finally, the simulation results and comparison with Slepian-Wolf coding suggest a connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
