The proposed method uses cascaded regressors, which is a machine learning technique (cs.MM) and involves offline learning from a set of 3D faces and their corresponding 2D face images, which is a form of supervised learning (cs.LG) and involves the use of a regression model (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
