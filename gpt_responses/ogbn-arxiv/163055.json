The use of Gauss sums is also a common technique in coding theory and cryptography, which further supports the relevance to these sub-categories. The paper also mentions the potential applications of the linear codes in secret sharing schemes, authentication codes, and data storage systems, which fall under the sub-categories of distributed systems (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
