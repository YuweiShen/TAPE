The paper also mentions the symmetric information rate (SIR), which is a concept in source coding (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses the belief-propagation (BP) algorithm, which is a common algorithm in coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper mentions empirical results, which could be related to machine learning (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
