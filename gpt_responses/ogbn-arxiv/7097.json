The use of adaptive preconditioning methods is a popular approach to improve optimization performance, and this paper proposes a new technique called extreme tensoring that is specifically designed for high-dimensional stochastic optimization (cs.NE). The paper also includes theoretical guarantees on the convergence and regret of the proposed method, which falls under the category of theoretical computer science (cs.DS). The authors apply their method to a large-scale natural language processing (NLP) model, which falls under the category of computer vision and natural language processing (cs.CV, cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
