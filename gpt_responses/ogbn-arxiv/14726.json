The use of genetic algorithms and swarm intelligence also suggests a connection to the field of neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also mentions the use of different building blocks for deep neural networks, which could be related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
