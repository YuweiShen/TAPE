The use of compliance shaping and series elastic actuators also suggests a connection to mechanical engineering (cs.ME). The focus on human-robot interaction and the design of the exoskeleton for improved user experience suggests a connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the validation of the methods on a physical system suggests a connection to robotics and automation (cs.ROB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
