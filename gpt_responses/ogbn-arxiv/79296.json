Therefore, cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.PL (Programming Languages) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses semantic proof techniques and abstract machine calculi, which are relevant to cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.TL (Theory of Computation). Finally, the paper touches on evaluation procedures, which is a topic in cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
