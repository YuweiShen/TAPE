The use of experience replay and the challenges associated with incorporating $\\lambda$-returns are also discussed, which are relevant to the subfield of reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DL (Deep Learning). The paper also applies the proposed method to playing Atari 2600 games, which falls under the sub-category of computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
