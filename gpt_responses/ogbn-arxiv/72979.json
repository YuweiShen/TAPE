The authors introduce a new task, Visual Semantic Role Labeling, which involves associating objects in the scene with different semantic roles for each action, which is a natural language processing task (cs.CL). The paper also presents baseline algorithms for this task, which involves machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the authors analyze error modes and provide directions for future work, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
