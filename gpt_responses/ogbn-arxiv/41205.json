This involves the use of different solution strategies for different types of instances, and the customization of solver parameters for a particular family of instances. These topics are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), programming languages (cs.PL), and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
