This methodology involves the use of event-based approach to represent karyotypes. These techniques are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI), database systems (cs.DB), and machine learning (cs.LG) research. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of natural language processing (cs.CL) and computational engineering (cs.CE) techniques in constructing the ontology."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
