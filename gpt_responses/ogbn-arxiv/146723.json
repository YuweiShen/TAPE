The proposed algorithms involve geometric computations and optimization, which are typical topics in computational geometry (cs.GR). The algorithms also involve decision-making based on certain conditions, which suggests the use of artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI). The use of data structures and algorithms to efficiently process large amounts of data is a common theme in computer science, and thus the paper could also belong to the data structures (cs.DS) or machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
