The paper also discusses the use of b-bit minwise hashing for large-scale batch and online learning, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of GPUs for fast preprocessing, which is a topic in computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of hash functions for implementing b-bit minwise hashing, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
