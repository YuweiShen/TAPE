It also involves algebraic coding theory and the study of subspace codes, which are relevant to cryptography (cs.CR). The paper uses arguments and techniques from combinatorics and graph theory, which are related to data structures (cs.DS) and social networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the list decoding of specific families of codes, which is a topic in complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
