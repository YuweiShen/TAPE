The use of AND/OR search spaces and Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDD) also suggests a connection to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Additionally, the discussion of Variable Elimination and APPLY algorithms suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the potential application of the AOMDD data structure to systems and control (cs.SY) is briefly mentioned in the abstract."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
