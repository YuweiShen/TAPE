Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, such as topic segmentation and text classification, which are relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with information retrieval (IR) in the sense of identifying references to scripts, which is relevant to cs.IR. Finally, the paper involves some aspects of computational social science (cs.CY), as it deals with everyday activities and scenarios that are common in human culture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
