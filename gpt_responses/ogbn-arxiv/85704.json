This is a topic that falls under data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper's focus on bent-negabent functions and their applications in cryptography makes it likely to be classified under this sub-category. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This sub-category deals with the analysis of social and information networks, which is not directly related to the paper's content. However, it is possible that the paper's results could have implications for network analysis and therefore be classified under this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
