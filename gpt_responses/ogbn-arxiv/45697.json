The paper proposes a generic diffusion process for handling multiple Gaussian denoising problems, which involves training a model to learn a regularization term. This falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper also discusses the transfer of the trained diffusion term to non-blind deconvolution, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
