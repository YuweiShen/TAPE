The paper also presents a framework for modeling the trade-off between control performance and privacy risks, which involves system control (cs.SY) and optimization (cs.CY) techniques. The authors use mutual information as a privacy metric, which is a concept from information theory and machine learning (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed framework using real-world occupancy data, which involves data analysis and machine learning techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
