The network structure is also an important aspect of the problem, which falls under social networks (cs.SOC) and possibly complex systems (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the comparison of different algorithms, which could be related to computational economics (cs.EC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
