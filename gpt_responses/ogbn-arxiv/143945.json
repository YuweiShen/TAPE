The approach utilizes a high-dimensional sensory stream and a lower-dimensional measurement stream to provide a rich supervisory signal. The paper also conducts extensive experiments in three-dimensional simulations based on the classical first-person game Doom. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
