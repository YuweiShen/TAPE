Specifically, the paper focuses on the analysis of Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL), Dual Averaging, and Mirror Descent algorithms, which are commonly used in online learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as these sub-categories are closely related to online learning. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of adaptive learning rates, which is a topic that falls under the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
