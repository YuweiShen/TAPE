This paper's focus on evaluating the performance of different algorithms for a specific task is relevant to cs.AI. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): Word embeddings can also be used in information retrieval tasks, such as document ranking and query expansion. This paper's analysis and evaluation of different algorithms for word representation could be relevant to cs.IR. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): Both skip-gram and continuous bag of words are neural network-based algorithms, and this paper's focus on tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance could be relevant to cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
