This involves processing and analyzing image data, which falls under the scope of computer vision. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper mentions the application of haptic feedback during robot-assisted minimally invasive interventions, indicating a robotics-related context. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The use of OCT image volumes as input data for force estimation involves multimedia data processing and analysis. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes the use of 3D CNNs for force estimation, which is a machine learning technique. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of machine learning techniques for force estimation falls under the broader category of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
