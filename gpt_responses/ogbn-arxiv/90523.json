Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. Additionally, it involves the evaluation of quality measures, which falls under Information Theory (cs.IT). The use of machine learning also suggests a possible connection to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with video compression, which is a common topic in the Multimedia sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
