The use of a non-uniform probability distribution to select variables and the resulting power-law distribution of variable occurrences is a topic related to computational complexity (cs.CC) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the potential use of the model for generating random instances for testing purposes, which is a topic related to data management (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
