The proposed method involves the use of a human-mask loss to guide the activations of feature maps, which is a technique that falls under the umbrella of supervised learning (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates its approach on two popular datasets for action recognition in still images, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
