The proposed method uses convolutional neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep learning method for nowcasting convective storms. The method involves training a neural network to predict storm initiation, growth, and advection. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an AI-based approach for nowcasting convective storms. The method involves using multi-source meteorological data and deep learning techniques to predict storm initiation, growth, and advection. \n4. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a neural network-based approach for nowcasting convective storms. The method involves training a multi-channel 3D-cube successive convolution network to predict storm initiation, growth, and advection. \n5. cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper involves the development of a software system for nowcasting convective storms. The proposed method involves building an end-to-end trainable model for nowcasting using multi-source meteorological data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
