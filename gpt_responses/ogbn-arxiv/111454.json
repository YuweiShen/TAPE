The proposed method also incorporates machine learning (LG) algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to leverage the contextual information associated with the videos. Therefore, cs.CV and cs.MM are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of web data and weak annotations, which falls under information retrieval (IR) and computational linguistics (CL), respectively. Hence, cs.IR and cs.CL are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
