The system has two types of ant agents that communicate with each other via pheromones. The paper discusses the probability for an ant to leave a bridge at a low occupancy condition of ants and proposes the constructing method of the optimal route. The paper also reports some experimental results showing the behaviors of great interest with respect to altruism of ants. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves stochastic diffusion of pheromones, which is related to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper discusses the behaviors of the system, which can be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
