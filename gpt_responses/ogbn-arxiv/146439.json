The use of intelligent automation systems also suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the challenges of communication in a distributed setup, which is related to systems and control (cs.SY). The use of ROS and ROS2 tools and utilities also suggests the involvement of machine learning (cs.MA) and possibly deep learning (cs.LG) for developing intelligent automation systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
