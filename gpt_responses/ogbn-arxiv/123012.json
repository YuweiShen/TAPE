The paper also discusses the challenges of scaling up the number of monitors and reducing the load on the network, which could be relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and system and control theory (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the potential for the algorithm to be used in detecting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which could be relevant to computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation and validation of the algorithm, which could be relevant to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
