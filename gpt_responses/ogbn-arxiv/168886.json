The paper also discusses computational properties of the semantics considered, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper uses logical frameworks to establish the semantics of the formalisms, which is a topic in logic (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the concept of minimality of change, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR).
