This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics sub-category.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, but the proposed manipulation technique may involve visual feedback to detect external contacts in the environment. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Computer Vision sub-category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed sampling-based planner uses sets of robust pushes to rapidly build a tree of reachable grasps, which involves AI techniques such as planning and optimization. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence sub-category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, but the proposed sampling-based planner may involve machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning or imitation learning to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the planner. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning sub-category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents a manipulation technique that involves controlling the motion of a robot and an object in contact with external surfaces, which may involve systems and control techniques such as feedback control or adaptive control.
