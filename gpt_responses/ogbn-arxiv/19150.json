This topic is closely related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG), as well as software engineering (cs.SE) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the use of heuristics suggests a focus on optimization and decision-making, which could fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
