This involves tasks such as event discovery, concept extraction, deep learning feature extraction, and event ontology organization. These tasks are closely related to computer vision (cs.CV), information retrieval (cs.IR), multimedia (cs.MM), natural language processing (cs.CL), and machine learning (cs.LG). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
