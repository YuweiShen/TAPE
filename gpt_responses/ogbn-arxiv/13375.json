The proposed approach involves clustering of image features, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.MM) and data mining (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), which are both techniques commonly used in machine learning and data analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
