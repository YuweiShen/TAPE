Additionally, the paper proposes a novel multi-task learning approach and dynamic weighting scheme, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also evaluates its proposed method on challenging datasets, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of neural networks for multi-task learning can also be related to neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
