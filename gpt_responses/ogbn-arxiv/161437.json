The paper also heavily relies on computer vision techniques such as object detection and activity recognition (cs.CV), and machine learning methods such as prior knowledge base and generalization (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed approach in daily life, which involves human-robot interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
