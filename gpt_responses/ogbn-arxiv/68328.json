The paper also discusses the use of multiple antennas and their spacing, which is related to the Signal Processing (cs.SY) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a practical implementation of the scheme, which involves selecting appropriate antennas from a large linear antenna array, which falls under the Mathematics of Computing (cs.MA) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
