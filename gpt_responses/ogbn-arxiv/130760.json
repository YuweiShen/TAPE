This involves visual analysis of speakers' lip movements, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM). The model also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it aims to recognize speech content from videos. Additionally, the use of bidirectional ConvLSTM and attention mechanisms suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and sequence modeling (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
