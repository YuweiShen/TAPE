Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes a new objective function that combines active learning, preference learning, and reinforcement learning, which are all subfields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also evaluates the proposed method using both simulation and real-user experiments, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) since document summarisation is often used to extract relevant information from large text collections."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
