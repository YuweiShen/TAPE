The use of Boolean functions and the analysis of their mutual information with the channel output suggests that it could also belong to the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) categories. The analysis of the error probability of the channel and the use of basic concepts from probability theory suggest that it could belong to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) category. Finally, the use of transformations of random variables and vectors suggests that it could also belong to the cs.SI (Signal Processing) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
