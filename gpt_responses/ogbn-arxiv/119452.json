This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of online tube-based MPC and the focus on dynamical systems further supports the Robotics and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. The use of reinforcement learning and policy transfer suggests that the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the focus on simulation and dynamics error suggests that the paper may also belong to the Simulation and Modeling (cs.SD) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
