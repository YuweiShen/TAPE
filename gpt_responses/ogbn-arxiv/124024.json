The proposed approach involves modifications to the authentication center and USIM, which are components of network infrastructure and network interface, respectively. Therefore, the paper could also be categorized under computer networks (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The proposed approach also involves the use of multiple IMSIs, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
