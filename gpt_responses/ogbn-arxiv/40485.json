The use of deep learning and neural networks suggests that the paper could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The focus on incorporating physics knowledge suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
