Additionally, the paper deals with resource-efficient image classification, which could also place it in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The use of deep neural networks and architectural blocks also suggests that it could belong to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category.
