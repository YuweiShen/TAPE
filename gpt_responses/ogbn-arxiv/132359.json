Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also applies the method to the problem of multi-document summarization, which falls under the categories of Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the use of submodular functions suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
