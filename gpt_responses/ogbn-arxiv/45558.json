This involves processing incomplete object models through a mirroring algorithm that assumes symmetry to create an approximate complete model and then fit for SQ representation. The grasping algorithm is designed for maximum force balance and stability, taking advantage of the quick retrieval of dimension and surface curvature information from the SQ parameters. The paper also evaluates the method on a PR2 and presents real-time results. Based on these details, the most likely sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics and Automation), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
