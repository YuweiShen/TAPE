The paper also discusses tensor decompositions, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The proposed method for efficient higher order convolutions is a novel approach that can be applied to various deep learning tasks, making it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
