This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the use of feedback channels, which is related to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). The use of codebooks and Grassmann packings suggests a connection to the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses simulation studies, which could be related to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
