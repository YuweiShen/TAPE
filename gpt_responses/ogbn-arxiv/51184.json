The use of activation maximization to generate visualizations also suggests a focus on neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the goal of enabling sleep apnea monitoring and machine learning-based detection at home suggests a potential focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
