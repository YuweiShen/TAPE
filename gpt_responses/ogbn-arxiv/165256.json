This involves designing an auxiliary classification network and a fine-grained aware module, which are jointly optimized on the TIR tracking task. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also involves training a network on a large-scale TIR dataset, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia). \n\nThe use of a multi-task framework and the development of a TIR-specific dataset suggest that the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nFinally, the focus on tracking suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
