It also involves the use of neural networks, which suggests that it could also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of transfer learning and depthwise separable convolutions, which are common techniques in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the use of a meta neural network to allocate object detection neural networks suggests that it could also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
