Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes a novel joint event extraction framework that uses graph convolutional networks, which falls under the category of machine learning and artificial intelligence, hence cs.AI and cs.LG are also likely categories. The paper also deals with capturing long-range dependencies and associations between arguments, which are important aspects of neural networks and can be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the extracted event information can be used for information retrieval and summarization tasks, which falls under the category of information retrieval, hence cs.IR is also a likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
