Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DB (Databases). The paper also disassembles the structures presented so far, identifies their underlying design primitives, and assigns them to appropriate design goals regarding PM, which falls under the category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also conducts experiments on real PM hardware, which could fall under the categories of cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) and cs.OS (Operating Systems). Finally, the paper provides general insights regarding PM-based data structure design, which could fall under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
