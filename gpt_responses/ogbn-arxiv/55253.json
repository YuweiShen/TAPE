The paper also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it deals with word embeddings. The proposed method involves joint learning of visually consistent word vectors and label embedding model, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach on benchmark datasets, which involves multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with visual data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
