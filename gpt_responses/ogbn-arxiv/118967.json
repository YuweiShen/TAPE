The application of this technology is for mobile robotic systems, which falls under robotics (cs.RO). The use of neural networks for object localization is a form of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of fast and accurate 2D detection approaches, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for combining high demanding neural networks with Internet of Things devices, which falls under graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
