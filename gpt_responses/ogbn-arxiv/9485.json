This involves sequential decision making under uncertainty, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The approach is implemented on hardware, which falls under robotics (cs.RO). The paper also proposes an iterative sampling-based Expectation-Maximization algorithm (iSEM) to learn policies, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The approach involves cooperative sequential decision making, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of macro-actions is a topic in multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
