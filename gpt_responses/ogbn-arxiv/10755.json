The proposed neural network architectures involve learning linear transforms and scalar nonlinearities, which are common themes in machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of the proposed methods in wireless communications, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper proposes a novel algorithm inspired by the vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm, which is a topic in numerical analysis and optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
