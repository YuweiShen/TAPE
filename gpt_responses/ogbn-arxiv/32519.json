The proposed solution involves modifying the architecture of deep neural networks, which falls under the category of deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of high level features and low level features, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper discusses the activation functions used in deep neural networks, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
