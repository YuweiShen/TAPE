It also discusses codes that are degenerate with respect to the rank metric, which is a topic of interest in cryptography (cs.CR). The study of codes and their properties is often related to topics in discrete mathematics (cs.DS) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses mathematical definitions and proofs, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
