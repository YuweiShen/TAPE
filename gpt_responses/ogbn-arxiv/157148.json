The strategy aims to minimize user interaction, which is a common goal in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The paper also focuses on ontology matching, which is a subfield of software engineering (cs.SE) and involves working with databases (cs.DB) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
