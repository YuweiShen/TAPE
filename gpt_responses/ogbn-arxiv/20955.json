Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is the most likely category. The paper also focuses on the physical implementation of Reservoir Computing using optical devices, which suggests the category cs.OC (Optical Computing). The paper also discusses the use of binarization strategies, which is related to Information Theory (cs.IT). The paper presents new advances in Reservoir Computing, which could be considered as a contribution to the field of Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with the prediction of chaotic systems, which is related to the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
