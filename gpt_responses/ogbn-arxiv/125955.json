Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of hash tables, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data mining (cs.DM). Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the new approach, which could be related to computational complexity (cs.CC) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
