Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper also analyzes the dependence of the bounds of different system parameters, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper presents numerical results, which involves mathematical modeling and analysis, and hence, can be categorized under cs.MA (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
