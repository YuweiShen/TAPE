It proposes a novel approach that leverages both 60GHz picocells and 2.4/5GHz hotspots, and discusses the challenges and opportunities associated with this approach. Therefore, cs.NI is the most likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - This paper discusses the use of 60GHz mmWave links for high-speed indoor and hotspot communications, which requires advanced signal processing and coding techniques. Therefore, cs.IT is a likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - This paper discusses the need for high-speed indoor and hotspot communications to support a variety of new applications, such as multimedia streaming and virtual reality. Therefore, cs.MM is a likely sub-category for this paper.\n\n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - This paper briefly discusses the security challenges associated with the proposed network architecture, such as the need for secure beamforming and authentication mechanisms. Therefore, cs.CR is a possible sub-category for this paper.\n\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - This paper proposes a cognitive module for intelligent beam switching in 60GHz directional links, which reduces the communication overhead and improves the user experience.
