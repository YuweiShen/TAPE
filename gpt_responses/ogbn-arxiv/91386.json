Additionally, it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as it deals with image quality assessment. Information Theory (cs.IT) is also a likely sub-category as the paper discusses different pooling strategies for IQA models. Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) are also possible sub-categories as the paper proposes a new pooling strategy and compares it with existing ones, which is a common theme in these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
