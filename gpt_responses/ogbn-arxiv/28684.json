This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper deals with the statistical multiplexing gain in fronthaul links, which involves the efficient use of information and communication. This makes it relevant to information theory. \n3. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) - The paper discusses the aggregation of remote radio units (RRUs) to share a fronthaul link, which is a communication and networking problem. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a model to analyze the fronthaul statistical multiplexing gain, which can be seen as a control problem in optimizing the use of resources. \n5. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) - While not the most likely category, the paper does touch upon the hardware architecture of C-RANs and the use of remote radio units (RRUs) in the fronthaul link."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
