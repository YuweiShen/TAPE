The use of neural networks for classification and tracking also suggests that the paper could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of the system in video surveillance also suggests that it could be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
