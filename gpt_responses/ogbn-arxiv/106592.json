The paper also discusses the assumptions made in these methods and provides theoretical results towards understanding them. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), systems and control (cs.SY), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
