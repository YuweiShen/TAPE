The proposed method involves the integration of high-order statistics into deep networks, which is a technique used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of multi-scale features, which is a common technique in multimedia processing (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of location information in object detection, which is a topic in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
