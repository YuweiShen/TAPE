The proposed framework involves integrating structured correlation information into a deep neural network, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of soft targets for regularization also involves natural language processing techniques (cs.CL). Finally, the experiments involve large-scale datasets and image processing, which could also fall under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
