The proposed algorithm is applicable to several different tasks, including robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the integration of different forms of human feedback, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
