This involves using deep learning architectures to learn nuisance-invariant discriminative features to eliminate within-recording variabilities in EEG activity. This approach falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of fatigue and vigilance levels during long EEG recording durations, which is related to neuroscience and behavior (cs.NE). The use of deep learning architectures also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
