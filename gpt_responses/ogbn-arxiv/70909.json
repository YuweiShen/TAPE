The paper formulates score following as a multimodal Markov Decision Process and proposes the use of synchronous advantage actor critic (A2C) algorithms to train multimodal RL agents that can simultaneously listen to music, read sheet music images, and follow the audio along in the sheet. Given this focus on RL algorithms and their application to a specific task, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.SD (Software Engineering). However, the paper also involves the use of deep learning techniques and multimodal data, which suggests that it could also be classified under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper involves the processing of sheet music images, which suggests that it could also be classified under cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
