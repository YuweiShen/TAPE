The strategy is designed for agents with a variety of dynamics, including holonomic and nonholonomic agents, which are often studied in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of relative position measurements and collision avoidance, which are relevant topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
