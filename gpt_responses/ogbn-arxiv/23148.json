The paper also focuses on non-classical logics, which falls under the category of logic and set theory (cs.LO). The use of machine learning methods suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the paper discusses the application of Q-learning to inform proof search, which is a topic related to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
