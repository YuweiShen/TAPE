Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves software engineering aspects, such as designing a secure component library, which makes cs.SE (Software Engineering) another likely category. The proposed solution involves access control, which relates to cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also mentions policies and custom policies, which are related to cs.PL (Programming Languages). Finally, the paper involves implementation details, which makes cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
