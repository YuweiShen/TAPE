The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for this task suggests that the paper belongs to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the difficulties encountered by classical registration approaches, which suggests that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The application of the proposed method to remote sensing further suggests that it may belong to the graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
