The use of multiple-antenna transmitters/receivers and linear combinations of information messages also suggests the sub-categories of Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the mention of cognitive interference channels and coordination points towards the sub-category of Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
