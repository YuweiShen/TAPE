The paper also discusses the use of oversampling, which is a common technique in signal processing (cs.SY) and networking (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of matched filtering, which is a common technique in digital signal processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
