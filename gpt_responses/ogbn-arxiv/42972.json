This task falls under computer vision (cs.CV) as it involves image processing and analysis. The proposed formulation involves learning class-specific features, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of large databases, which suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the task of preventing purchase of alcohol and tobacco by minors involves security and privacy (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
