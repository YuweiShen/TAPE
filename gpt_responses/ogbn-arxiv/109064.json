The use of dynamic programming and approximation algorithms further supports these categories. The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) in the definition of the normalized cut value. The application of the algorithm to clustering problems suggests that it could also belong to the categories of social and information networks (cs.SI) or computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
