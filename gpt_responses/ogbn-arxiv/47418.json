It also uses two neural networks with similar structures to predict pixel level semantic score and derive pixel affinities, which are common techniques in computer vision research. Additionally, the proposed scheme achieves high performance on the Cityscapes dataset, which is a popular benchmark for computer vision tasks. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it involves the use of neural networks to perform a complex task. \n\nThe Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper uses machine learning techniques to cluster pixels into instances. \n\nThe Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category is another possibility as the paper involves the use of neural networks, which are a type of artificial neural system. \n\nFinally, the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category is a possibility as the paper deals with image segmentation, which is a common multimedia task."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
