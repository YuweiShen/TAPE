The proposed algorithm is based on ontology, which is a common topic in Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The algorithm also involves activating and adding named entities, which could be related to Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) and Machine Learning (cs.LG).
