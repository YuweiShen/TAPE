This suggests that the paper may belong to the cryptography and security sub-category.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep learning model and a training/inference scheme to protect the input, output, and model in the application of neural networks. This suggests that the paper may belong to the machine learning sub-category.\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper discusses a deep learning model and a training/inference scheme, which are often used in computer vision and pattern recognition applications.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper may belong to the social and information networks sub-category as it discusses a scheme to protect the privacy of customer data in the context of service providers.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper may belong to the data structures and algorithms sub-category as it proposes a novel mechanism to secure the deep neural network without using any complicated cryptography component."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
