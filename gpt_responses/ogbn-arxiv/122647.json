The paper proposes a method for generating hybrid locomotion paths, which involves making decisions based on the robot's environment and capabilities, and optimizing for stability. This involves the use of AI techniques such as path planning and motion planning, which are relevant to the sub-category of cs.AI. The paper also discusses the use of sensors and feedback control to ensure stability, which is relevant to the sub-category of cs.SY. Additionally, the paper includes experiments with visual perception and obstacle avoidance, which are relevant to the sub-categories of cs.CV and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
