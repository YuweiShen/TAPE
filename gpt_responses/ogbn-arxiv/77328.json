This approach is tested on video classification tasks using multiple real-world video datasets. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the proposed approach involves training the weights simultaneously, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, since the proposed approach is tested on classification tasks, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
