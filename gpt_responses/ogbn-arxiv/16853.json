The problem also has applications in cartography and geographic information systems, which fall under the category of computer graphics (cs.GR). The paper proposes an approximation algorithm based on line stabbing, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for solving optimization problems. Finally, the paper extends the algorithm to handle rectangular labels, which involves image processing and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
