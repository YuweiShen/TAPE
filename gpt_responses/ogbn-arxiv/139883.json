The proposed method uses bidirectional optical flows to handle locally varying and general blurs caused by various sources, such as camera shake, moving objects, and depth variation in a scene. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with optimization and efficient solvers, which are common topics in Graphics (cs.GR) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The paper also deals with handling dynamic scenes, which is a common topic in Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a single energy model that simultaneously estimates optical flows and latent frames, which is a common topic in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
