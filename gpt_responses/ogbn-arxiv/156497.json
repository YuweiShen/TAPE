The framework also includes AI algorithms, which could place it under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. The paper also mentions the use of REST, HTTP, and Web Services, which are common in Software Engineering (cs.SE). The system is mobile-compatible with Android, which could suggest the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category.
