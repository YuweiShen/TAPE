The approach involves using B-splines to represent trajectories and a non-uniform kinodynamic search strategy, which could also fall under the categories of control systems (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of Euclidean signed distance fields (ESDF) for adjusting the step length during the search process, which could relate to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
