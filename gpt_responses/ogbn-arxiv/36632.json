This topic falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the application of the method to regression tasks, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper introduces a novel method for approximating moments in neural networks, which is a technique commonly used in neuroscience (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
