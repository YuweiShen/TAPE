It also involves coding techniques, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) or signal processing (cs.SI). The use of correlated sources suggests a possible connection to networking (cs.NI), while the analysis of performance and sufficient conditions could be related to computer communications (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
