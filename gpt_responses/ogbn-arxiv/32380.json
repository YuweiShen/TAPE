Melee, a console fighting game, as a testbed for the proposed solution. This involves graphics rendering and animation, which falls under the domain of graphics. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a solution to the action delay problem by endowing agents with a neural predictive model of the environment, which can be considered as a form of control system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
