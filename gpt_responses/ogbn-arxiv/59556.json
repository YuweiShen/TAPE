The paper also presents a novel approach to detect and classify rain or fog with lidar sensors only, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.AI). The analysis of the point cloud data and the weather detection also involve statistical analysis and data processing, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
