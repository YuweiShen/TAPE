This can be related to information theory. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The proposed approach involves a base station sending feedback information to active users, which can be seen as a control system. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper mentions transmitting data packets, which can be related to multimedia applications. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - Although not the main focus of the paper, the proposed approach involves transmitting preambles and feedback information, which can have implications for security and cryptography."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
