This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Programming Languages sub-category.\n\n2. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper focuses on proving the correctness of algorithms using abstract interpretation. This is a key concern in software engineering, making cs.SE a likely sub-category.\n\n3. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses the design of new operators for abstract interpretation, which involves logical reasoning. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Logic in Computer Science sub-category.\n\n4. cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper uses Difference-Bound Matrices, which are widely used by model-checkers. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Formal Languages and Automata Theory sub-category.\n\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the efficiency of the new numerical abstract domain and presents graph-based algorithms. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
