The paper also proposes efficient encoders and decoders, which are relevant to cryptography (cs.CR) and coding theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper may also be of interest to researchers in computational complexity (cs.CC) due to the focus on efficient algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
