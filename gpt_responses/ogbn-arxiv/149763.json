The paper focuses on improving the effectiveness of the semantic similarity measure of GO terms by integrating information content (IC) and structural information of GO hierarchy. This work involves machine learning and data mining techniques, which are commonly associated with the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and databases (cs.DB). The paper also involves network analysis and prediction of protein-protein interactions, which are associated with the sub-categories of computational engineering, finance, and science (cs.CE) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
