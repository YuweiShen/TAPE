The paper also discusses the impact of modifying images on object detection, which is related to adversarial attacks and robustness of machine learning models (cs.AI, cs.LG). The analysis of the phenomena and possible reasons for it suggest a focus on computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the non-local impact of object transplanting on object detection could also be of interest to researchers in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
