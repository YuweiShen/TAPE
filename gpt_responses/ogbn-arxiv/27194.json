The proposed Gaussian-based softmax function is a novel approach to achieving this goal, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The evaluation of the proposed method on classification datasets and multi-label classification datasets also involves image processing and computer vision techniques, which could be categorized under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
