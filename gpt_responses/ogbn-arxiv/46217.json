This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The experiments conducted in the paper involve computer vision tasks (cs.CV) and natural language processing tasks (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper proposes defense strategies to prevent such leakage, which could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
