The paper also discusses the tradeoff between key consumption and number of channel uses, which is a topic of interest in coding theory (cs.CC) and communication theory (cs.CE). Finally, the paper introduces a new parameter called effective key consumption, which is a measure of the efficiency of the system, and could be of interest to researchers in the field of systems and information (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
