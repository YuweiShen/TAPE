Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SP (Signal Processing) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also uses probabilistic methods and coherence parameters, which are common in machine learning and statistics, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a likely sub-category as well. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of randomness in the signal and/or interference, which is relevant to the field of randomized algorithms, making cs.MM (Multimedia) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves numerical optimization techniques, which are commonly used in scientific computing, making cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
