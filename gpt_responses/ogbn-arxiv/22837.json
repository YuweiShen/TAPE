This involves encoding raw low-level 3D cartesian trajectories and converting them into a high level (HL) action grammars, which can be used for behavior monitoring and task verification. This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
