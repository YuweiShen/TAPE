The system uses a specimen-level image descriptor that is highly discriminative, has a small descriptor length, and is semantically meaningful at the cell level. The paper proposes two max-margin based learning schemes to discover cell attributes whilst still maintaining the discrimination of the specimen image descriptor. The evaluation is done on a novel HEp-2 cell dataset, and the proposed approach is able to provide textual descriptions to explain ANA patterns. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM) are also possible sub-categories as the paper deals with image classification and textual descriptions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
