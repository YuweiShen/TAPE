This falls under the realm of information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SP). The paper also discusses the computational burden of the proposed method, which could potentially fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of compressed sensing (CS) in previous approaches, which could place it under the sub-category of CS (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
