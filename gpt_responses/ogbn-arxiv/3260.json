The proposed method also involves machine learning techniques, such as training on synthetic data, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses defending against adversarial attacks, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the use of weighted quadratic Bezier curves for stroke representation may also be relevant to image retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
