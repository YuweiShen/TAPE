Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses security concerns, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The proposed solution involves designing and implementing a new framework, which could fall under cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper discusses resource allocation, which could fall under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
