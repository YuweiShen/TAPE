The paper proposes a new normalization method called CrossNorm to prevent divergence and improve training. This is a topic that falls under the category of machine learning, and more specifically, deep reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper also discusses the application of CrossNorm to DDPG and TD3, which are algorithms used in robotics and control tasks. This suggests that the paper could also fall under the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper also mentions the use of MuJoCo benchmark tasks, which involve visual perception and manipulation, indicating that it could also belong to the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
