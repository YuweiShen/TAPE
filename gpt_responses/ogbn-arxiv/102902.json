This is a common problem in several subfields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper specifically mentions cross-language tasks, which suggests a focus on natural language processing and potentially computer vision as well. Therefore, cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.CL, cs.AI, and cs.NE are all likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
