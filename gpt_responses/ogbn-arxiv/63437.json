Additionally, the paper proposes a new RL algorithm that enables stable and fast learning, which could fall under the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The use of structured policies as a mechanism for knowledge transfer across tasks suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of locomotion and manipulation domains, which could fall under the cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the data-efficiency of the proposed method, which could suggest that it belongs to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
