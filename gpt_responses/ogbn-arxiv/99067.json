Specifically, it uses a convolutional network to detect pre-printed text and input text lines, and then pools features from the detection network to classify possible relationships in a language-agnostic way. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.DL) techniques, which further support the likelihood of these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
