The proposed method involves learning to synthesize new samples for an unseen category, which is a task that falls under the umbrella of few-shot learning (cs.LG). The method is based on a modified auto-encoder, which is a popular deep learning architecture used in various applications of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed approach involves learning transferable intra-class deformations, which is a task that involves optimizing neural network parameters, and hence falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the synthesized samples are used to train a classifier, which is a task that involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
