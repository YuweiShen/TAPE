Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper specifically focuses on image attribution methods, which suggests that cs.CV (Computer Vision) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the behavior of neural network parameters in later layers, which suggests that cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) may be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the theoretical and empirical assessment of modified BP methods, which suggests that cs.CL (Computation and Language) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
