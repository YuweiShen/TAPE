The tool is based on a generic partition refinement algorithm, which is presented using category theory and coalgebras, indicating a connection to logic in computer science (cs.LO). The algorithm is implemented in software, suggesting a connection to programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the algorithm's runtime is analyzed, indicating a connection to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
