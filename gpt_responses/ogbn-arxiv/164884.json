The use of formal semantics and web-scalable implementations suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and digital libraries (cs.DL). The paper also mentions the integration of existing representation languages, which could fall under programming languages (cs.PL) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the emphasis on mathematical knowledge management and logic-independent concerns suggests a connection to logic (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
