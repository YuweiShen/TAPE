The proposed dynamic trust repair model also involves artificial intelligence techniques to improve the performance of the swarm (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the requirements for motion control and team behaviors, which are related to control systems and systems engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of incorrect trust on human-supervisory tasks, which is related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
