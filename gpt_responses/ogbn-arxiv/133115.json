This involves formulating a hierarchical policy where a high-level controller selects among sets of policies trained on different types of intrinsic rewards and the low-level controllers learn the action policies of all agents under these specific rewards. This work involves reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and coordination, which are all relevant to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
