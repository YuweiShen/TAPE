The paper also discusses the bidirectional version of the type system, which is related to logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper's focus on gradual typing and its comparison to previous work on gradual typing suggests that it could also be categorized under software engineering (cs.SE) and formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
