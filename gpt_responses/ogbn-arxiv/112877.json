The proposed system involves detecting changes in software behavior, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of electromagnetic side-channel measurements is a form of hardware security (cs.CY). Finally, the paper specifically mentions the use of Siemens S7-317 PLCs, which is a type of programmable logic controller (PL), further supporting the inclusion of cs.PL as a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
