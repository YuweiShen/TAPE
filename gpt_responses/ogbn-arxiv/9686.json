The specific focus on functional optimisation and the use of shape priors suggests that the paper is most likely to be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of control variables that change over time also suggests a possible fit with cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the application of the approach to short polymer fibre design and optimising learning rate schedules for deep networks suggests a possible fit with cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
