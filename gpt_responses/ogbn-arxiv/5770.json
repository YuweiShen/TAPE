The use of parallax angle based feature parameterization and observation-ray based objective function suggests that the paper is likely to be related to computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO). The proposed pose-graph simplification and convexified initialization strategies involve optimization and machine learning techniques, which could also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper's focus on handling diverse outdoor environments and collinear motion modes suggests that it could be related to graphics (cs.GR) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
