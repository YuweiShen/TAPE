Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely category as it deals with the fundamental limits of information transmission and processing. The paper also involves wireless communication systems, which suggests cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as a likely category. The use of beamforming and antenna diversity indicates cs.SI (Signal Processing) as another possible category. The paper also deals with mmWave frequencies, which suggests cs.MM (Multimedia) as a likely category. Finally, the paper uses a statistical spatial channel model based on real-world propagation measurements, which suggests cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
