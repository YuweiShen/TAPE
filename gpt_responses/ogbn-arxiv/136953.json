The use of active acquisition to reduce uncertainty in the reconstruction process suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) techniques. The validation on a large scale dataset and the use of a ResNet-based architecture also suggest a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
