The paper focuses on the development of a model that can estimate the true label and annotator variable expertise for both labeled and unlabeled data. This problem is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), computer vision (cs.CV), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
