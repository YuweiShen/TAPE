The use of ground truth data and validation of TD and OCR models suggest that the paper may also belong to information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL) subcategories. The use of augmented images and relevant annotations may also suggest a machine learning (cs.LG) subcategory. Finally, the dataset creation and management may also suggest a data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) subcategory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
