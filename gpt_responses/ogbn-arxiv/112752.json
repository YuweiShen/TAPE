The proposed approach involves image comparison in a compressed domain, which suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM). The use of bag-of-words (BoW) image representation and place-recognition techniques also suggests relevance to information retrieval (cs.IR). The practical application of the proposed approach to moving object detection (MOD) further suggests relevance to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the use of machine learning techniques for change detection suggests relevance to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
