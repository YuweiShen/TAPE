It also involves signal processing techniques to resolve the ambiguity issue. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) as it involves the estimation of AOA (Angle of Arrival) which is a key concept in information theory. \n\ncs.SY (Systems and Control) is another likely sub-category as the paper discusses the design of a dynamic and collaborative system for self-localization. \n\ncs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) is also a possible sub-category as the system is designed to be constructed with user's devices as network nodes, which can be seen as a multi-agent system. \n\nFinally, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is a possible sub-category as the paper may involve machine learning techniques for signal processing and localization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
