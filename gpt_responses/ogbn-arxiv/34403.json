The use of neural networks for image compression also falls under machine learning (cs.MM) and information theory (cs.IT). The end-to-end learning framework and optimization of components suggest a focus on deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
