This involves the use of image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, which are commonly associated with computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. The paper also addresses the problem of spoof detection, which is a common issue in cybersecurity (cs.CR). The use of ensemble classifiers and photometric stereo methods suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and image retrieval (cs.IR) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
