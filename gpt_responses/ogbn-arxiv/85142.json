The use of Faster R-CNN, a popular object detection algorithm, suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The evaluation of different configurations and feature extractors also suggests relevance to the information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
