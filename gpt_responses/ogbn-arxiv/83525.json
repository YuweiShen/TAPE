The paper also discusses the performance and complexity of different spreading schemes, which could fall under signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of the replica method for analysis is a statistical physics technique, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
