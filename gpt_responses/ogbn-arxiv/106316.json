This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper considers the side-information setting, which involves one encoder sending the full sequence, and the use of binning error, which are topics related to source coding (cs.SI) and data structures (cs.DS), respectively. The paper also analyzes the tradeoff between error probabilities and communication rates, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.MM) and learning theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
