This involves using an online and unsupervised adaptive clustering algorithm to identify objectives and Q-learning to learn them in parallel. The approach is demonstrated using a simulated agent and environment, indicating a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of Q-learning suggests a focus on robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the implications and possible extensions of the proposed approach, indicating a potential focus on natural language processing (cs.CL) and other related fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
