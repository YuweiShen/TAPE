This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of generative adversarial networks to generate synthetic patient records is an application of artificial intelligence.\n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses privacy concerns and proposes the use of synthetic data to mitigate risk. This falls under the domain of cryptography and security.\n4. cs.DB (Databases): The paper deals with generating patient records, which are typically stored in databases. The proposed approach could have implications for database management.\n5. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses privacy concerns and the potential risks associated with sharing real patient data.
