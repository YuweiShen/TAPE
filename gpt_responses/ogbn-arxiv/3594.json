It may also belong to Multimedia (cs.MM) as it involves the analysis of facial images. Additionally, it could be categorized under Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it involves the use of classical statistical learning methods and deep learning methods for benchmark evaluations. Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) is another possible sub-category as the study involves the perception of facial beauty by humans. Finally, Information Retrieval (cs.IR) could be a relevant sub-category as the study involves the retrieval of information about facial attractiveness ratings."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
