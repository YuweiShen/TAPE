The use of a progressive training method and attention loss also suggests that it may fall under the Machine Learning (cs.MM) and Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the proposed compressed version of the face alignment network (FAN) may indicate that it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Lastly, the focus on facial attributes and details may suggest that it could also fall under the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
