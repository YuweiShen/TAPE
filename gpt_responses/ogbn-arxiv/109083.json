This falls under the category of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). The system also involves information retrieval techniques to find the most similar question from a database, which is related to Information Retrieval (cs.IR). The use of NLTK and CoreNLP tools for NLP suggests the involvement of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The evaluation of the prototype also involves analyzing the results obtained, which falls under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the system is designed to assist users in finding solutions to their queries, which can be related to Cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
