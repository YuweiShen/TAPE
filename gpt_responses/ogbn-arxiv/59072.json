The proposed method involves attentional layers, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) tasks. Additionally, the paper presents results on bioinformatics datasets, which suggests that it may also fall under the category of computational biology (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
