The proposed framework involves training dynamics conditioned policies and efficiently learning to estimate the dynamics parameters of the environment given off-policy state-transition rollouts in the environment. This involves techniques from machine learning (policy learning) and robotics (system identification). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.RO (Robotics), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
