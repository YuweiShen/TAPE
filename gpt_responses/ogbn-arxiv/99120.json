Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also focuses on learning generalisable feature representations, which involves machine learning techniques such as instance normalisation and architecture search, suggesting that cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories.
