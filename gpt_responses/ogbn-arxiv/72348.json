It proposes a pre-training method that uses a supervised autoencoder framework and jointly trains a weighted supervised classification loss, an unsupervised reconstruction loss, and an expected return loss. The paper focuses on improving the performance of the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm in Atari games of Pong and MsPacman. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, since the paper deals with reinforcement learning, cs.RO (Robotics) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, since the paper proposes a novel pre-training strategy, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
