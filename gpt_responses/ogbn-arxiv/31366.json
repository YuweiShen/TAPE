The application of this technology is for emergency response and disaster management, which falls under robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the development of a lightweight CNN architecture, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of real-time image classification for emergency response, which could be considered a topic in computer security and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
