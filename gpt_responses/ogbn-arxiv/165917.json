The authors use unsupervised learning principles (cs.AI) to track mechanically-salient objects in videos and to train visual motion predictors that can take the underlying environment into account. The paper also involves robotics (cs.RO) as the authors introduce a new dataset of real objects rolling on complex terrains. Finally, the authors use convolutional neural networks (cs.NE) as their choice of architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
