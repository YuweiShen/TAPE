This involves using convolutional models, which are commonly used in computer vision. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper addresses the crucial aspect of predicting the future state of traffic actors for safe and efficient operations of autonomous vehicles. This is a key problem in robotics, especially in the context of autonomous driving. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep learning-based approach for predicting future movement of traffic actors. This involves using convolutional models and accounting for inherent uncertainty in the prediction task. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an AI-based approach for predicting future movement of traffic actors. This involves using deep learning models and accounting for uncertainty in the prediction task. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper addresses the problem of predicting future state of traffic actors for safe and efficient operations of autonomous vehicles.
