Additionally, the paper also involves graphics (cs.GR) as it converts the point cloud into a polygon mesh. The use of deep learning networks also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on multi-view maps and optimization problems suggests that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
