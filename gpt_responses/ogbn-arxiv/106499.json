The method involves aligning block-level outputs between teacher and student networks, which involves estimating parameters and could potentially involve natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques. The paper also mentions experiments on various datasets, which suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
