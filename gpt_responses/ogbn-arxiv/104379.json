Therefore, cs.MM (Multimedia) is the most likely category. The paper also deals with bandwidth allocation and rate adaptation, which are networking issues, making cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) another likely category. The paper proposes a non-cooperative game theory-based algorithm, which falls under cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). The paper also considers Quality of Experience (QoE) of users, which is a user-centric metric, making cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) a possible category. Finally, the paper proposes a distributed iterative algorithm, which falls under cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
