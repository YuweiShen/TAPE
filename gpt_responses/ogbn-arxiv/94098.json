The paper focuses on the optimization of computation time and storage space, which are key concerns in the field of machine learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
