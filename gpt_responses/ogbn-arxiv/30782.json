The focus is on symmetry breaking problems, which are a fundamental topic in distributed computing. The paper presents time and message efficient algorithms for ruling sets, which are a generalization of the Maximal Independent Set problem. This makes the paper relevant to several sub-categories of arXiv CS, including Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Algorithms (cs.AL), and Information Theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
