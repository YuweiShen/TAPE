This involves the study of information transmission and processing, which falls under the scope of information theory.\n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper discusses protecting the primary user from potential interference by the secondary users. This involves security and cryptography aspects of cognitive radio networks.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a class of distributed MAC protocols for spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks. This involves the study of systems and control in networked systems.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the utilization of MAC design in cognitive radio networks to achieve efficient spectrum sharing. This involves the study of multimedia communication and networking."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
