The paper also discusses the power of randomization in algorithm design, which is a common topic in computational complexity theory (cs.CC). The construction of a list of short programs involves data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and the paper also discusses the lower bounds for deterministic constructions, which is related to cryptography (cs.CR).
