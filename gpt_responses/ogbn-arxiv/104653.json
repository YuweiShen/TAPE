The paper also discusses information theoretical measures such as entropy and mutual information, which are commonly used in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also uses random projection (RP) based low dimensional embeddings, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper demonstrates the efficiency of the method through numerical examples, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
