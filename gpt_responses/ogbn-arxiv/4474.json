The paper combines the strength of deep learning and support vector machine (SVM) to identify the support data from the old data, which are fed to the deep learning model together with the new data for further training. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
