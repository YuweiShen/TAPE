The use of Cayley analysis and visualization techniques suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG). The algorithmic solutions presented for finding paths of continuous motion and closest realizations involve control systems (cs.SY) and optimization (cs.MS). The study of connected components in configuration spaces also has connections to dynamical systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
