The problem formulation also involves metric spaces and graph theory, which are relevant to the subfield of computational geometry (cs.CG) and theoretical computer science (cs.TH). However, since the focus of the paper is on designing approximation algorithms for the problem, rather than proving theoretical bounds, we consider cs.SI (social and information networks) as the least likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
