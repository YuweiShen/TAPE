This topic falls under the intersection of several computer science subfields, including computer architecture (cs.AR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), datacenters (cs.DC), neural networks (cs.NE), and systems and control (cs.SY). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AR, cs.AI, cs.DC, cs.NE, and cs.SY, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
