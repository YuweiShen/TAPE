The paper focuses on the use of AI technologies to solve problems related to self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing in the framework of Self-Organizing Network (SON). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of AI technologies for crowd estimation and prediction, which falls under the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The development of the drone-cruiser base station requires innovative design and control of the drone-cruisers, which falls under the sub-category of cs.RO (Robotics). \n\nThe paper also discusses the integration of WiFi front-haul and millimeter wave/WiGig back-haul networks, which falls under the sub-category of cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper discusses the use of AI technologies for self-healing, which falls under the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
