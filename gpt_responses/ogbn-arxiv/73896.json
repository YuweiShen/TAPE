Therefore, cs.GT (Game Theory and Economics) is the most likely category. The paper also involves algorithms and computational complexity, which suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as another likely category. The paper's focus on optimal revenue and incentive compatibility suggests cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.EC (Economics and Computation) as additional categories.
