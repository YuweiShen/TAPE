The paper also discusses leveraging model robustness (cs.LG) and using natural image statistics to defend against adversarial perturbations (cs.CR). The algorithm presented in the paper does not require retraining or modifying the CNN, which suggests a focus on practical applications (cs.AI). Finally, the paper uses wavelet-based denoising, which is a common technique in multimedia processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
