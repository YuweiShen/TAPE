The proposed algorithm is designed to improve system performance, which falls under the category of systems and control (SY). The paper specifically focuses on massive multiuser MIMO, which is a subfield of multimedia (MM) and machine learning (LG) as it involves processing large amounts of data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
