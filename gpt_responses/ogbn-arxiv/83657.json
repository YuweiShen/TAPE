It involves resource deployment, allocation, and mapping of logical networks into physical infrastructure. This topic is closely related to network infrastructure (cs.NI), distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC), and systems and control (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of mixed-integer linear programming, which falls under information theory (cs.IT) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
