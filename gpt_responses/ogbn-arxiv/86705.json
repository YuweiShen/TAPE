The use of nonconvex optimization and gradient descent updates suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG). The applications mentioned in the abstract, such as molecular geometry recovery and phaseless diffractive imaging, suggest that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and scientific computing (cs.SI). Finally, the use of numerical experiments suggests that the paper may also be relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
