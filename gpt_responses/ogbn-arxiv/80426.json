Additionally, the paper uses empirical data to construct measures of participation, which could fall under the sub-category of social informatics (cs.SI). The study also analyzes the growth of peer production projects, which could be relevant to the sub-category of software development (cs.SD). The paper's focus on organizational structure and leadership could also be relevant to the sub-categories of computer and society (cs.CC) and cryptography and security (cs.CR), as these fields often involve discussions of power dynamics and governance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
