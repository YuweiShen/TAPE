The use of multiple receive antennas and antenna selection also suggests a possible connection to networked communication systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The analysis of the distribution of input-output mutual information may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.MM) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
