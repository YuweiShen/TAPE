This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.LG: The paper proposes a framework that includes a Prolog library of deep feedforward neural networks. This involves the use of machine learning techniques, which is a subfield of machine learning.\n- cs.CL: The paper involves the use of logical rules in the form of definite clauses and teaching neural networks to use the rules in reasoning processes. This falls under the domain of computational linguistics.\n- cs.PL: The paper involves the use of resolution, which is a fundamental concept in logic programming. This falls under the domain of programming languages.\n- cs.NE: The paper proposes a technique that involves the use of neural networks. This falls under the domain of neural networks and their applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
