The paper also proposes a novel framework for disentangled face synthesis, which involves the use of encoder-decoder networks and feature threshold loss, indicating a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper introduces a new database for multi-view face images, suggesting a possible sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
