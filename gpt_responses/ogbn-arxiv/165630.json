The approach takes into account the possibility to process nonnumeric data by means of an embedding procedure. The paper also proposes a graph-based fuzzy model to associate a confidence level with the classifier decision. The experiments are conducted on well-known benchmarks containing both feature vectors and labeled graphs, and the method is applied to the protein solubility recognition problem by considering several representations for the input samples. Based on these characteristics, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
