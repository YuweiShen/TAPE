The paper also mentions the use of programs and oracles as proof verifiers, which falls under the scope of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also touches on the verification of software, which is a topic in cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper discusses the complexity of proof verifiers, which is a topic in cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
