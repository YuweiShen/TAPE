The experiments are performed with a real UR10 robot manipulator along with WSG-50 two-finger gripper for grasping of objects. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The proposed technique estimates the object contour in the point cloud and predicts the grasp pose along with the object skeleton in the image plane. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a real-time grasp pose estimation strategy for novel objects in robotic pick and place applications. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed technique involves predicting the grasp pose for novel objects, which can be seen as a machine learning problem. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the problem of grasping of objects in a robotic system, which can be seen as a systems and control problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
