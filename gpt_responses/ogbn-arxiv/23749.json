This involves using a modified QMIX network structure and the ${Q(\\lambda)}$ approach. The paper also discusses experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) benchmark. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). The paper also involves some aspects of robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY), which are less likely but still relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
