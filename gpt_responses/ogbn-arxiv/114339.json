The problem involves coding and prefetching of files, and the proposed solution involves developing a delivery scheme for the stored coded packets in the cache. This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI), as well as distributed computing (cs.DC), control systems (cs.SY), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
