The tool combines statistical hypothesis testing with logical reasoning and provides a visual representation of the testing data and hypotheses. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) for the visual analytics aspect, Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) for the focus on machine learning models, Information Retrieval (cs.IR) for the hypothesis-based evaluation, and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) for the potential application of the tool to network analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
