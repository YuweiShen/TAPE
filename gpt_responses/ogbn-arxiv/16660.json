This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a neural network model for EEG classification, which involves learning the connectivity structure and signal features directly from raw EEG signals. This is a machine learning problem, and the paper could be submitted to the cs.LG sub-category.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper deals with EEG signals, which are related to the brain and neurons. The proposed model involves learning the connectivity structure of the brain regions, which is a neural computing problem. Therefore, the paper could be submitted to the cs.NE sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an end-to-end neural network model for EEG classification, which involves learning the connectivity structure and signal features directly from raw EEG signals. This is an AI problem, and the paper could be submitted to the cs.AI sub-category.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper deals with EEG signals, which are time-series data. The proposed model involves learning the connectivity structure and signal features directly from raw EEG signals, which is similar to the problem of learning features from time-series data in computer vision.
