Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions digital text forensics, which falls under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The evaluation of the AV methods involves the use of corpora, which suggests a connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms).
