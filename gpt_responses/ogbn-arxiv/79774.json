The approach integrates topic modelling and regression to overcome vocabulary differences and length discrepancies between questions and answers. Based on this description, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper's focus on topic modelling and regression suggests a strong emphasis on machine learning and natural language processing, which aligns with these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
