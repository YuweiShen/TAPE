This involves learning content representation from question title and body, and fusing it with the representation of the heterogeneous relationship between user and tags. This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories such as Information Retrieval (cs.IR) which deals with search and recommendation systems, Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) which deals with natural language processing, Machine Learning (cs.LG) which deals with developing and evaluating learning algorithms, Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) which deals with analyzing and modeling social networks, and Deep Learning (cs.DL) which deals with developing and applying deep neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
