The paper also mentions data-parallel processing (cs.DC) and optimizations (cs.PL), which are relevant sub-categories. Finally, the use of hybrid protocols and the focus on scalability suggest that the paper could also be classified under distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
