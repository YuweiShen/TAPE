Therefore, cs.IT and cs.CR are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of multivariate polynomials and finite fields, which are topics that are commonly studied in computer science and mathematics. Hence, cs.DS and cs.CC are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper presents a novel scheme for private monomial computation, which involves the use of entropy and random variables, which are topics that are commonly studied in information theory and statistics. Therefore, cs.SI is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
