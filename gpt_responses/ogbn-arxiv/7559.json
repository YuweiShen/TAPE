The paper also proposes a new training method that utilizes hard example mining, which is a common technique in machine learning, hence cs.LG and cs.AI are also likely categories. Additionally, the paper uses augmentation techniques, which are commonly used in multimedia processing, hence cs.MM is a possible category. Finally, the paper discusses the practicality and security of person re-identification systems, which could fall under the category of cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
