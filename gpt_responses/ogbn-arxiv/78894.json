The proposed dataset is used for training and evaluating deep learning models, which falls under machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the performance of stereo SR algorithms, which involves evaluating the quality of images, a topic related to graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the paper mentions the availability of the dataset online, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
