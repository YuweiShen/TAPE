This involves introducing a stochastic doubly robust gradient (SDRG) consisting of two models: weight-corrected gradients for inverse propensity score weighting and per-covariate control variates for regression adjustment. The paper also identifies the connection between double robustness and variance reduction in SGD. Given these topics, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper deals with statistical inference and causal inference, which suggests cs.STAT (Statistics) as another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper involves optimization and numerical methods, which suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
