The optimization involves designing the beamformer at the access point and the phase shifts at the IRS to maximize spectral efficiency. This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also proposes efficient algorithms for solving the optimization problem, which involves manifold optimization techniques, falling under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The use of IRSs also involves signal processing (cs.MM) and communication networks (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
