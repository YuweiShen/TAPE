This involves the use of data mining techniques, such as artificial neural networks, which falls under the scope of machine learning.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Similar to the above, the paper involves the use of artificial neural networks and other data mining techniques to create probabilistic energy forecasts. This falls under the broader category of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with energy forecasting, which is a problem in systems and control. The use of quantile regressions and nearest neighbors filtering to solve this problem may also fall under this category.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper involves the use of artificial neural networks to create probabilistic energy forecasts, which falls under the scope of neural computing.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents a new nearest neighbors quantile filter, which involves the use of data structures and algorithms to efficiently compute quantile regressions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
