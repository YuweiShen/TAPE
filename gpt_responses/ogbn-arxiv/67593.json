The approach involves using a Convolutional Neural Network to extract multi-level abstract representations of the raw data for near and distant future predictions, and then modeling the interplay between multiple predictive tasks and fusing their future visions through a modified Encoder-Decoder architecture. The paper also combines traditional Autoregression model with the neural network to solve the scale insensitive problem. Given these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
