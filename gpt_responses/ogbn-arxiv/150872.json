This falls under the scope of software engineering (cs.SE), computer engineering (cs.CE), and systems and control (cs.SY). The use of state graphs and a domain-specific language also suggests the application of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and programming languages (cs.PL) in the development of the Energy Navigator."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
