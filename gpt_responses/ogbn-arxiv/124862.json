The paper also discusses a decoding algorithm, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of cycles and cliques in the construction of index codes is related to graph theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the generalization of cycles and cliques, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
