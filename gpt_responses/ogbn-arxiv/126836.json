This falls under the software engineering (cs.SE) category. The approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network classifier, which is a popular machine learning technique (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of source code metrics, which falls under programming languages (cs.PL) and software development (cs.SD). Finally, the paper uses historical information to improve the detection of anti-patterns, which can be seen as a form of time-series analysis and prediction, falling under artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
