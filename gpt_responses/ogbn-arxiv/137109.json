The approach involves extending an existing ranking technique to compute a multifaceted retrieval result and designing a composite visualization with three visual components. The paper focuses on the information retrieval aspect of microblogs and the development of a visual analytics approach to support exploratory retrieval. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Other likely sub-categories include cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SD (Software Engineering), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
