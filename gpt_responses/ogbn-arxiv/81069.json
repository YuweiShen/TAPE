This is a topic that is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel coded caching scheme that has a lower subpacketization level, which is a key parameter in coded caching. This makes it relevant to the sub-category of system and information theory (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the practical implications of coded caching, which makes it relevant to the sub-category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper deals with content delivery networks, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of computer networks and communications (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
