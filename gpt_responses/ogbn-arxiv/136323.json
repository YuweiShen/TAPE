The use of graphs and the concept of d-separation also suggest information theory (cs.IT) and data structures (cs.DS) as possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the need for a causal dynamics to guarantee a unique solution, which could be relevant to systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
