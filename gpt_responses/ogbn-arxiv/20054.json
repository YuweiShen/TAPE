The paper also discusses the use of compressive sensing methods, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also deals with the analysis of noise influence, which is a problem of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the use of a nonparametric quadratic time-frequency representation-based method, which is a technique used in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
