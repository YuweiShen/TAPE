As such, it is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computational linguistics (cs.CL), and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper proposes a method for jointly estimating the individual annotator model and the underlying true label distribution, using only noisy observations. This approach is likely to be of interest to researchers working in any of these sub-fields, as it addresses a common problem in supervised learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
