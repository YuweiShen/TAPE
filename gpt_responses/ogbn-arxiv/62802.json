The paper also discusses the input cost constraints, which is a topic in information theory and signal processing (cs.ITP). The paper mentions Gaussian mixtures and heavy-tailed noise models, which are topics in machine learning and data analysis (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the analyticity properties of the triplet, which is a topic in scientific computing and numerical analysis (cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions numerical computations, which is a topic in numerical analysis and scientific computing (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
