The paper also leverages linguistic knowledge to improve the performance of the model, which falls under natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of knowledge distillation is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG), and the paper also involves training a deep model (cs.AI). Finally, the experiments are conducted on visual datasets (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
