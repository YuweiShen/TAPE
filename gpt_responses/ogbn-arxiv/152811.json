The proposed method involves using conventional intensity sensors and continuous illumination to recover occluded objects, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of a trainable architecture to map diffuse indirect reflections to scene reflectance, which is a machine learning task (cs.AI, cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves analyzing the directionality of hidden surface reflectance, which is related to graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the paper discusses the use of consumer color image sensors for NLOS imaging, which is related to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
