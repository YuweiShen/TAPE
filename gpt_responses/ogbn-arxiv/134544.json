The paper proposes two methods to deal with interference in match kernels, which involves modifying the aggregation stage of the image representation. This modification can be seen as a machine learning problem, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also conducts experiments on standard public image retrieval benchmarks, which involves evaluating the performance of the proposed methods, and this falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
