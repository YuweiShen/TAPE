The paper also discusses the use of runtime monitors, which are a type of software engineering technique (cs.SE). The paper proposes formal models of runtime monitors, which involves the use of formal methods (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the deployment of monitors on low-resource devices, which is related to cyber-physical systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the validation of the monitors through simulated attacks, which is related to computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
