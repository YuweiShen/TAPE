The use of correlation-clustering and integer linear programming also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of dual optimal inequalities, which are commonly used in optimization and linear programming (cs.DS). Finally, the application of entity resolution has relevance to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
