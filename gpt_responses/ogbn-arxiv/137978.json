The focus on high-dimensional and sparse data suggests that the paper may belong to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) or information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. The mention of clustering, nearest neighbour search, ranking and indexing further supports this. The use of compression techniques and evaluation on parameters such as time and space requirements suggests that the paper may also belong to the databases (cs.DB) or machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the mention of similarity measures and the comparison with state-of-the-art techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
