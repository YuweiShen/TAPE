The results are based on graph theory and combinatorial optimization techniques, which are typical of the subfields of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), computational geometry (cs.CG), graph theory (cs.GT), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
