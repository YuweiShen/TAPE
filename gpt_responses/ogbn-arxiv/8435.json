The concept of width, which measures the complexity of a strategy, is a common measure in formal language theory, which suggests the paper may also belong to the categories of formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL) or logic in computer science (cs.LO). The paper also mentions lower bounds, which are often studied in computational complexity theory, suggesting it may belong to the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper deals with the manipulation of symbols, which is a common theme in programming languages and compilers, suggesting it may also belong to the category of programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
