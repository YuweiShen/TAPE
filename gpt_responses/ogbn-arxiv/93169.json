The paper also introduces a relaxed notion of approximate metric-fairness, which involves measuring similarity between individuals, and this could potentially fall under the subfield of cybernetics (cs.CY). Additionally, the paper discusses the computational complexity of fairness constraints, which could fall under the subfield of cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the generalization of fairness from a training set to the underlying population, which could fall under the subfield of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
