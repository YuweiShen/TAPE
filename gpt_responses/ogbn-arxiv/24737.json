The authors focus on filtering via access control lists (ACLs), which are a key component of network infrastructure (cs.NI). They also consider the trade-off between filtering efficiency and legitimate traffic blocking, which is a topic of interest in systems optimization (cs.SI). The paper presents algorithms for optimal source prefix filtering, which involves data analysis and decision-making, making it relevant to data science (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
