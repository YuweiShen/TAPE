Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves algorithms and architectures for FPGA implementation, which could fall under cs.AR (Architecture) and cs.ET (Embedded Systems). Additionally, the paper discusses the complexity of linear data detection, which could fall under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
