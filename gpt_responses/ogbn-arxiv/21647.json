Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also mentions the use of deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper proposes a unique network architecture that solves metric-learning based feature embedding and keyframe selection, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions the use of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), which is a type of recurrent neural network, indicating that it could belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
