The paper proposes a method that combines traditional statistical machine translation (SMT) and neural machine translation (NMT), which involves using an existing phrase-based SMT model to compute the phrase-based decoding cost for an NMT output and then using this cost to rerank the n-best NMT outputs. This approach involves machine learning techniques such as deep learning and optimization, which are also relevant to the subcategories of \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI), \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG), and \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions using image captioning as an example application, which falls under the subcategory of \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\" (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
