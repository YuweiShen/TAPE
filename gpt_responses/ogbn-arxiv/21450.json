Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces a two-stage learning scheme, which involves training a CNN and a gradient boosting classifier, indicating that it may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of contextual features and the application to multi-person tracking suggest that it could also be classified as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). Finally, the paper uses publicly available sequences to evaluate the proposed method, indicating that it may also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
