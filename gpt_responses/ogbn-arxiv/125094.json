The method involves attaching probes to intermediate layers of a neural network, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of loss functions such as cross-entropy loss, least squares loss, and hinge loss, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper leverages per sample hardness estimates, which is a concept commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
