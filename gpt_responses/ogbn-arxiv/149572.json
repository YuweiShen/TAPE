The proposed method involves a knowledge-induced learning approach with adaptive sampling variational autoencoders, which falls under the category of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also deals with system condition monitoring and fault detection, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The use of deep learning algorithms and the simulation of a case study also suggest the categories of neural networks (cs.NE) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
