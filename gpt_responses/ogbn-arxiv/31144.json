The focus on mutual information and its scaling suggests a strong connection to information theory and signal processing, which are often studied in the cs.IT and cs.SI sub-categories. However, the paper also discusses specific types of sequence models, including RNNs and Transformers, which are commonly studied in the cs.LG sub-category. Additionally, the paper's focus on natural language texts suggests a connection to the cs.CL sub-category. Finally, the paper's theoretical and empirical analyses suggest a connection to the cs.NE sub-category, which focuses on neural networks and their properties. Overall, cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.NE, cs.IT, and cs.SI are all likely sub-categories for this paper, with cs.LG and cs.CL being the most likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
