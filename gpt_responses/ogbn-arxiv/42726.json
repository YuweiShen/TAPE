The paper also introduces a new approach for generating adversarial examples, which involves a psychometric perceptual adversarial similarity score (PASS) measure, and a diverse set of adversarial perturbations. This approach is related to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several network topologies, which is relevant to the field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
