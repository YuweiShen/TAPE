The experiments conducted in the paper are primarily on image classification datasets, which suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) could also be a relevant sub-category. The paper also discusses the generalization behavior of ReLU networks, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Finally, the paper proposes a new norm for measuring capacity, which could be relevant to the sub-category of data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
