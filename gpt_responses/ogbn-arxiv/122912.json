The use of deep reinforcement learning suggests that the paper could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). The application of the strategy to autonomous driving suggests that it could also belong to cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also mentions the use of computer vision to perceive the driving environment, which suggests that it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper deals with control and decision-making in a dynamic system, which suggests that it could belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
