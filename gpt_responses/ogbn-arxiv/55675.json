The use of multiple streams and feature fusion is a popular technique in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the creation of a dataset, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). The problem of false alarms caused by similar designs or license plates can be seen as a security issue, which is covered by cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the use of optical character recognition (OCR) to extract textual information can be seen as an information retrieval problem (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
