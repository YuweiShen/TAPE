Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely category. The paper proposes a method to estimate the future cost of generating the next target word in NMT, which involves modeling the contextual information of the current generated target word. This requires the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as neural networks and deep learning, which makes cs.AI a likely category as well. The proposed method involves boosting the training of the NMT model, which is a task of machine learning (ML) and falls under the category of cs.LG (Learning). The paper also mentions the use of Transformer-based NMT baseline, which is a type of neural network architecture and falls under the category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the proposed method involves improving the generation of target translations, which is a task of computer vision (CV) and falls under the category of cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
