The use of irreflexive relations and hierarchies is particularly relevant in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL), as they are often used to represent taxonomies and ontologies. The approach proposed in the paper involves modeling translations, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and database systems (cs.DB). Finally, the evaluation of the approach involves standard evaluation protocols, which is a common practice in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
