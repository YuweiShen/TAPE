Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes a novel CNN model for aspect extraction, which involves training on pre-trained embeddings. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper achieves good results without using additional supervision, which suggests that it may also be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
