The scheme exploits the sparsity of the channel matrix for the effective selection of a limited number of antennas. This involves optimisation problems related to information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a practical scenario where there is a realistic correlation among the antennas and imperfect channel estimation at the receiver side. This involves networking and internet architecture related issues.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper proposes a scheme for a massive MIMO system with a single user terminal and a base station with a large number of antennas. This involves social and information network related issues.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with a massive MIMO system with a single user terminal and a base station with a large number of antennas. This involves multimedia related issues.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes an optimisation problem related to minimising the mean squared error for computing a sparse channel matrix. This involves computational engineering, finance, and science related issues."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
