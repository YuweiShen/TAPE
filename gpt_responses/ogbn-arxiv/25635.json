The paper specifically addresses the issue of adversarial examples, which are commonly studied in the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) subfields. Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of outliers on the trained model, which is a topic that is relevant to the subfield of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the proposed approach involves modifying the training process of the neural network, which is a topic that falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
