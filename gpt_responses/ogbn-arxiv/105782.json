The use of end-to-end learning also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions obstacle avoidance, which is a common topic in control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the validation of the learned policy on a physical robot suggests a potential application in computer vision (cs.CV) for perception and localization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
