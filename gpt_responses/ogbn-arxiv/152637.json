Computer vision techniques are used to overlay the RGBD data onto the real-time images. \n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper proposes an easy-to-use system that simplifies impactor and cup placement according to the planning by providing a real-time RGBD data overlay. The system is evaluated in a user study comprising four orthopedic surgeons. \n3. cs.RO (Robotics): Although the paper does not explicitly mention robotics, the use of AR visualization and computer vision techniques in the proposed system can be related to robotics. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper uses RGBD data overlay to provide real-time visualization during the surgery. \n5. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper uses 3-D augmented reality (AR) visualization to simplify impactor and cup placement according to the planning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
