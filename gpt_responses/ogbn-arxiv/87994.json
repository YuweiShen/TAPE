It also uses game theory to model the interactions between the autonomous vehicle and other drivers, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also introduces a novel algorithm for planning, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
