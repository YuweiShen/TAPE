Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves multiple users and interference mitigation, which suggests that it could belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of EKF and adaptive noise variance tracking module suggests that it could belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
