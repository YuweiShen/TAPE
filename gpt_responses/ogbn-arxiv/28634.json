Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper proposes a novel multi-stage training strategy that improves triplet loss, which involves learning a metric space to compare images. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), which deals with learning algorithms and models. Additionally, the paper uses multiple levels of feature maps to make the learned features more discriminative, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also introduces a global hard identity searching method to sample hard identities when generating a training batch, which could be related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
