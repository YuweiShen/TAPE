Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Architecture (cs.AR) or Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories. Additionally, the proposed solution involves the use of counters and adaptive trees, which are common in System and Control (cs.SY) and Embedded Systems (cs.ET) research. Finally, the paper also discusses the performance and power overhead of the proposed solution, which is relevant to the Design Automation and Verification (cs.DC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
