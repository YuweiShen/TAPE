It focuses on the concept of strong secrecy and how it can be embedded in WNC schemes by exploiting structured interference. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the mathematical foundations of information and communication. The paper also discusses the practical implementation of WNC schemes, which suggests that it could belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper discusses the security aspects of WNC, which could place it in cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also mentions the use of multiple antennas, which could place it in cs.SI (Signal Processing) or cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
