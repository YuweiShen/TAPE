The construction is based on algebraic geometry, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the computational geometry (cs.CG) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of asymptotic bounds and sparsity orders, which are common in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and dynamical systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the strong coherence property, which is related to signal processing and machine learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
