It also involves the use of large datasets of face images, which is a common theme in computer vision research. The paper also involves the use of semi-supervised learning, which is a topic that falls under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of prior knowledge and graph convolutional networks, which are topics that fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of multi-modal data, which is a topic that falls under the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
