The proposed method uses a deep neural network architecture with skip connections and instance normalization, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of pre-trained VGG network, which is a popular deep learning model for image recognition (cs.GR). Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
