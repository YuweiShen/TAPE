This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as well as computer vision (cs.CV) since facial and vocal samples are used as biometrics. The paper also involves multi-modal sensing (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) since the authors propose a method to comprehensively profile victims. Finally, the paper deals with cyber-physical systems (cs.CY) since it explores the leakage of identity across both cyber and physical spaces."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
