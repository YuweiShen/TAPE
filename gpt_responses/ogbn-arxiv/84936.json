The method involves correcting errors in the weak classifiers, which could also be related to natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper mentions testing the method on little data sets, which could be related to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
