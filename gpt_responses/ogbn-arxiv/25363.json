The concept of Price of Fairness is also a well-known concept in game theory. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The problem of resource allocation is a common problem in AI, and the paper proposes different definitions of fairness to solve this problem. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a quantitative measure (Price of Fairness) to evaluate the quality of fair solutions, which can be seen as a learning problem. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes different algorithms to solve the problem of resource allocation under different definitions of fairness. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The problem of resource allocation is a common problem in social networks, and the paper proposes different definitions of fairness to solve this problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
