The paper also proposes a hybrid attention mechanism, which involves the use of attention modules and the cross-level group normalization, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also evaluates the proposed method on the COCO detection dataset, which is a common benchmark in multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper uses Retina-Net, which is a neural network architecture, and proposes a new architecture called HAR-Net, which involves joint learning, a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
