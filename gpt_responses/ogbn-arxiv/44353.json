The focus on success probability and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) coverage probability suggests a possible fit with the sub-category of stochastic processes (cs.SI). The optimization of power allocations for NOMA users also suggests a possible fit with the sub-category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Finally, the use of meta distribution and moments analysis suggests a possible fit with the sub-category of game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
