This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a convolutional mechanism with attention for text recognition, which suggests that it may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of a Feature Pyramid Network, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL) and deep learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper's focus on end-to-end trainable models suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
