The paper also discusses transmission policies and scheduling policies, which are related to information theory (cs.IT). The use of hearing control mechanisms to coordinate transmissions is a topic that falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The paper also proposes a new definition of universal stability, which is related to control systems (cs.SY) and optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
