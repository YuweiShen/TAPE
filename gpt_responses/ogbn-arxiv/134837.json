The paper proposes a novel approach that uses distant supervision on an auxiliary task (sentiment classification) to generate abundant data for RST-style discourse structure prediction. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which is dedicated to NLP and computational linguistics. \n\nThe paper also uses a neural variant of multiple-instance learning, which falls under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes an optimal CKY-style tree generation algorithm, which is a type of algorithmic optimization (cs.AI). \n\nThe paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) since it deals with the task of predicting discourse structure. Finally, the paper involves computational complexity theory (cs.CY) since it proposes an algorithmic optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
