It also involves the study of structural properties of graphs, which falls under discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.GT). The problem of simultaneous embedding of multiple graphs is related to graph drawing and visualization, which is a topic in both computer science (cs.SI) and computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper discusses the concept of quasiplanarity, which is a property of graphs that has been extensively studied in the literature on graph algorithms and combinatorial optimization (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
