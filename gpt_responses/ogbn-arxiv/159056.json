The paper proposes a new method for improving the quality of the approximation obtained by information projections, which are a key building block of variational inference algorithms. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with reducing the dimensionality of the original model, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
