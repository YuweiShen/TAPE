The focus on sparse vectors and disjunctive measurements suggests a connection to compressed sensing (cs.DM) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of randomness condensers and explicit constructions suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
