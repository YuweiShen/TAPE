The use of a RGB-D Google Tango tablet as a human-robot interface suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also mentions the use of computer vision techniques to define virtual borders in the environment (cs.CV) and the evaluation of the system's accuracy using machine learning methods (cs.AI). Finally, the paper's focus on ensuring human-aware navigation suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
