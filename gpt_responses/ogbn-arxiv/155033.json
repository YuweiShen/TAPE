The problem is motivated by caching and wireless networks, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and social and information networks (cs.SI). The paper also introduces a new coding scheme to exploit side information, which could be of interest to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents a general outer bound and analyzes the performance of the coding scheme over an erasure broadcast channel, which could be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) for developing efficient communication protocols."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
