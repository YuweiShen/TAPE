The paper specifically focuses on discourse-aware summarization, which involves capturing the relationships between sentences or discourse units in a document. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which encompasses research on NLP and computational linguistics. Additionally, the paper uses deep learning techniques, such as BERT and graph convolutional networks, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques, as summarization is often used to extract key information from large documents. Finally, the paper proposes a novel model architecture, which could fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
