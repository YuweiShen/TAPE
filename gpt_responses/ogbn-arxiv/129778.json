The use of multiple antennas also suggests a possible connection to networked systems (cs.NI). The analysis of signal-to-interference plus noise ratios (SINRs) and user scheduling can be related to signal processing (cs.SI). The use of computer simulations suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the analysis of system performance can be related to computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
