Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses metrics and distances between Reeb graphs, which falls under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper's focus on graphical summaries and maps suggests that it could also be relevant to cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
