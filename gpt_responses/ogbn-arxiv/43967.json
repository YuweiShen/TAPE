The paper also addresses data security issues, which is a common concern in the field of cryptography (cs.CR). The approach proposed in the paper involves distributing data over multiple cloud service providers, which requires efficient load balancing and computing resources, falling under the categories of distributed computing (cs.DC) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper also discusses the cost efficiency of the proposed approach, which is a common concern in software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
