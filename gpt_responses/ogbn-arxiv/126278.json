However, the use of stochastic geometry and the focus on the performance analysis of multi-antenna networks suggest that cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. Other possible sub-categories include cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), as these sub-disciplines also deal with aspects of wireless networks and their performance analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
