The paper proposes a novel architecture for object classification, which involves using computationally efficient networks to propose image regions likely to contain objects, and more powerful networks to classify the proposed regions. This approach involves training the networks using image-level annotations, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also mentions using cascades or trees for efficient object classification, which falls under neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
