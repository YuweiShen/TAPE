The proposed method involves training two models, a student model and a teacher model, and transferring knowledge from the teacher to the student using distillation techniques. This work involves machine learning (ML) techniques for improving prediction accuracy, which is a common theme in the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with information retrieval (IR) tasks such as click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CVR) prediction, which falls under the sub-category of cs.IR. The paper also involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques for feature extraction, which is a common theme in the sub-category of cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves computer vision (CV) techniques for feature extraction, which is a common theme in the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Finally, the paper involves artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for improving prediction accuracy, which is a common theme in the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
