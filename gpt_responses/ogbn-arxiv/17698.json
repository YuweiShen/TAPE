The paper also mentions experiments on image datasets such as YALE B and COIL-100, which suggests that the paper may belong to the computer vision sub-category. The use of a unified objective function and nonnegative and sum-to-one constraints on the similarity suggest that the paper may belong to the machine learning sub-category. The optimization of the regularization parameter also suggests that the paper may belong to the optimization sub-category. Overall, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.CV, and cs.AI, followed by cs.NE and cs.SD."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
