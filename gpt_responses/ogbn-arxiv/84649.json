This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and privacy (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the transferability of the tickets across datasets and architectures, which could be relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of a custom score function, which could be related to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
