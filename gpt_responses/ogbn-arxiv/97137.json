It uses a neural network to select future bitrates based on previously observed network status and past video frames. The paper also focuses on obtaining a higher perceptual video quality with possible lower sending rate and transmission latency. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper uses deep learning techniques to train the neural network, which falls under the category of cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper also deals with network conditions, which is related to cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
