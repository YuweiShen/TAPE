This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT), computational complexity (cs.CC), and optimization (cs.DS). The use of linear programming to compute bounds and tradeoffs also suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the toolbox may be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG) who are interested in understanding the limits of information processing in their models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
