The paper also introduces new tools for enhancing these algorithms, which could fall under information theory (cs.IT) or machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper develops new distributed approximation algorithms for fundamental problems, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
