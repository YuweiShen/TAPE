The paper also addresses the issue of achieving secrecy capacity, which is a key concern in cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of polar codes, a popular coding technique in communication theory, suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of coding theory (cs.CC). The extension of the construction to broadcast channels with confidential messages may also make the paper relevant to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
