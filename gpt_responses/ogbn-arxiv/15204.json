Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as it deals with wireless networks. The paper also discusses topics related to computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY), which are relevant to the applications of edge ML. Finally, the paper touches upon distributed computing (cs.DC) as it discusses the collective training and inference over wireless links."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
