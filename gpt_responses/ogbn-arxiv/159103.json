This topic falls under the category of emerging technologies (cs.ET) as it proposes a new hardware architecture for DNN training. Additionally, the paper discusses the design considerations for the RPU devices, which could fall under the categories of computer architecture and digital circuits (cs.AR), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), systems and control (cs.SY), and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
