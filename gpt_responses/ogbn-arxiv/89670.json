This suggests that it could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses algorithmic problems and solutions, which could place it in the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
