The use of regular languages and graph isomorphism suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also involves the analysis of symmetries, which is a common theme in computational complexity (cs.CC). The generation of two-layer prefixes involves the manipulation of graphs, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the empirical evaluation of the proposed method involves statistical analysis, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
