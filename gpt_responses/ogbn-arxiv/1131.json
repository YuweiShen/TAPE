Therefore, cs.SE (Software Engineering) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses a Self-Assessment Manikin tool to measure affective reactions, which falls under the category of Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation and testing phases of software development, which could fall under Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Computer Engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the paper could also be relevant to the sub-category of Emerging Technologies (cs.ET) as TDD is a relatively new and evolving practice in software development."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
