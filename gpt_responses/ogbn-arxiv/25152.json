The paper also discusses the optimization of the network for detection performance, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of neural networks for object detection also involves the use of optimization algorithms, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the network on different datasets, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
