Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also uses ensembles of NMT models, which is a common technique in machine learning and artificial intelligence, hence cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also likely. The paper also involves tuning the models for both APE and QE tasks, which falls under the category of machine learning and optimization, hence cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also possible categories. Finally, the paper deals with language modeling and translation, which is related to Information Retrieval (IR), hence cs.IR is also a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
