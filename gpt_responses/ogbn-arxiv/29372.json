Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves algorithms and approximation schemes, which suggests that it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The use of homothetic sets and pseudodisks in the paper indicates that it could also belong to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) sub-categories, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
