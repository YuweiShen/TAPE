This falls under the scope of distributed computing.\n2. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the creation of 3rd party Cloud brokering services for building content delivery networks and e-Science applications and their deployment on capabilities of IaaS providers such as Amazon along with Grid mashups. This falls under the scope of computational science and engineering.\n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents Aneka, a Platform as a Service software system containing SDK (Software Development Kit) for construction of Cloud applications and deployment on private or public Clouds, in addition to supporting market-oriented resource management. This falls under the scope of software engineering.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the internetworking of Clouds for dynamic creation of federated computing environments for scaling of elastic applications. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n5. cs.Distributed Systems: The paper discusses the architecture for creating market-oriented Clouds and computing atmosphere by leveraging technologies such as virtual machines, and provides thoughts on market-based resource management strategies.
