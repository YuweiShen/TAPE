This involves the use of linear precoding algorithms and power allocation techniques. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the study of communication systems and their limits. The paper also involves networked MIMO, which falls under the category of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The coordination strategy proposed also involves system-level optimization, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also involves simulations, which falls under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper involves optimization algorithms, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
