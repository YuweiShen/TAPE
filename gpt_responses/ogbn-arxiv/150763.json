The paper also provides inner bounds on the robust stealth capacities, which is a typical information-theoretic problem. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper deals with the problem of stealth communication in the presence of an active adversary, which is a typical problem in cryptography and security. The paper also considers two types of jamming, which is a typical security problem. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with the problem of communication over a multipath network, which is a typical problem in networking and internet architecture. The paper also considers the problem of eavesdropping and jamming, which is a typical networking and security problem. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with the problem of communication in the presence of an active adversary, which is a typical problem in systems and control. The paper also considers the problem of reliable communication, which is a typical control problem. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the problem of communication over a multipath network, which is a typical problem in multimedia. The paper also considers the problem of reliable communication, which is a typical multimedia problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
