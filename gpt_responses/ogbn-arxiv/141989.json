Therefore, the most likely category is cs.AI. The paper also proposes methods for solving the inverse reward design problem, which involves inferring the true objective based on the designed reward and the training MDP. This problem is closely related to machine learning and optimization, which are covered in cs.LG and cs.RO, respectively. The paper also discusses the use of the proposed methods for planning risk-averse behavior in test MDPs, which falls under the category of control and systems engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of mitigating reward hacking, which is a security concern and therefore falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
