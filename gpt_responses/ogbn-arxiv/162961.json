The codes are of constant weight and distance, which are properties studied in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also introduces new constructive techniques, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The codes are also analyzed for their error-correcting capabilities, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
