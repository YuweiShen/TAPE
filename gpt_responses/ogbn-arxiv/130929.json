Therefore, it is most likely to belong to the cs.DB (Databases) sub-category. It also mentions custom special methods as extensions to the SQL language, which suggests it could also belong to the cs.PL (Programming Languages) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of the LLVM compiler infrastructure, which could place it in the cs.SE (Software Engineering) or cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. Finally, since the paper discusses the performance benefits of read-only tables, it could also be relevant to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
