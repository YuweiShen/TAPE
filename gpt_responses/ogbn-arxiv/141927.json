The proposed solution involves using joint transmission and precoding, which are techniques commonly used in information theory (cs.IT) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of dummy symbols, which is a technique used in multimedia communication (cs.MM) and communication networks (cs.COM). Therefore, these five categories are the most likely to be relevant to this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
