The model is based on semantic feature space and uses a deep convolutional neural network for classification. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with video representation and retrieval, which falls under the domain of multimedia. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper proposes a model for video event retrieval, which is a task related to information retrieval. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a classifier to create a semantic space and applies pooling operations to create the final representation, which involves machine learning techniques. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with semantic feature space and high-level video feature vectors, which are related to natural language processing and understanding."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
