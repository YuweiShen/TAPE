The paper also constructs a counterexample involving prismatoids, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and combinatorics (cs.DM). The use of nested polyhedral bands suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS). The problem of edge-unfolding is related to graph theory (cs.GT) and geometric rigidity (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
