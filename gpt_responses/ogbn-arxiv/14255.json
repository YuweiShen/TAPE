The authors propose a Sparse Coding and Dictionary Learning approach to study time-varying shapes on the Kendall shape spaces of 2D and 3D landmarks, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of shape trajectories for action recognition and facial expression recognition, which are common topics in multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
