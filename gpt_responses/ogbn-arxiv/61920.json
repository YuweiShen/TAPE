The approach involves explicitly representing and learning the local structure in the conditional probability tables (CPTs), which can be seen as a form of data mining (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the theoretical foundations and practical aspects of learning local structures, which can be considered as a form of statistical inference (cs.SI) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
