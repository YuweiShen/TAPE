The paper also proposes a viable on-orbit semantic segmentation strategy, which involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO) in the aerospace industry. Additionally, the paper discusses the computing environment of satellites, which is related to the field of graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
