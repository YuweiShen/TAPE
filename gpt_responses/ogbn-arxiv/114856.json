This problem falls under the intersection of multiple sub-fields of computer science, including multi-agent systems (cs.MA), robotics (cs.RO), distributed computing (cs.DC), control systems (cs.SY), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper, with cs.MA and cs.RO being the most likely due to the focus on multi-agent systems and robotics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
