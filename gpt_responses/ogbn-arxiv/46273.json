Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval, which falls under the sub-category cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The use of deep learning models for watermark recognition suggests the sub-category cs.DL (Machine Learning) as well. The paper also discusses the challenges faced by archivists and historians, indicating the sub-category cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). Finally, the paper deals with a large dataset, which could also fall under the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
