Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves the formulation and analysis of the dual of flow relaxations via continuous extensions of submodular functions, which falls under the category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper discusses the interplay between the Lov\\'asz extension of a submodular function and line embeddings with low average distortion, which is related to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). Finally, the paper involves graph theory and optimization, which are relevant to cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
