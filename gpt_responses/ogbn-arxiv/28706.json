The use of CA also involves the study of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the potential hardware realization of the proposed framework, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper presents results and analysis of the performance of the proposed framework, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
