This topic is closely related to natural language processing (NLP), which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper proposes a regularization technique to address an ambiguity issue in the SGNS model, which involves modifying the objective function. This modification is a form of optimization, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also presents a theoretical justification for the regularization technique, which involves analyzing the properties of the objective function. This analysis is related to the field of neural networks (cs.NE) and optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
