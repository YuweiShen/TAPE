The use of deep neural networks for segmentation and supervised learning also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The focus on real-time applications and autonomous driving suggests that it could also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of multispectral sensors suggests that it could belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
