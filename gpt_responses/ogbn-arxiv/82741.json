Additionally, the use of deep reinforcement learning suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The study of primitive and composite reward functions also suggests a focus on control systems (cs.SY) and computer vision (cs.CV) to evaluate the behavior of the robotic bodyguards."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
