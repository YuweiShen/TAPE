This makes cs.DS a likely sub-category.\n2. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with discrete optimization problems and proposes new valid inequalities. This makes cs.DM a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper discusses the integrality gaps of linear relaxations for min-knapsack, which is a topic of interest in game theory. This makes cs.GT a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the complexity of separating pitch-1 inequalities, which is an NP-hard problem. This makes cs.CC a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.OC (Optimization and Control): The paper proposes new valid inequalities for the min-knapsack problem, which is an optimization problem.
