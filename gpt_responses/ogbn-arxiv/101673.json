The paper proposes a combinatorial algorithm to construct provably-optimal diverse b-matchings in pseudo-polynomial time. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the categories of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), game theory and economics (cs.GT), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
