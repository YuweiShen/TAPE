The paper also introduces a quantitative extension to the notion of monadic second-order logic, which falls under the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. The use of algebraic formalism and stabilisation monoids suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. The paper's focus on solving various problems related to regular cost functions may also make it relevant to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category. Finally, the paper's use of algebraic recognisability and the boundedness problem may suggest relevance to the Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
