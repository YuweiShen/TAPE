The authors also mention that their algorithm can be used for indexing large text collections (cs.IR) and for building hash tables for databases (cs.DB). The algorithm is designed to be scalable and efficient, which are also important concerns in distributed computing (cs.DC) and big data analysis (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
