The paper also introduces a graph-based framework that uses graph convolutions, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The framework also involves propagating information between connected nodes, which is a common technique in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper evaluates the framework on three different tasks, including visual information extraction, which falls under the category of Computer Vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper deals with extracting information from text, which is a subfield of Information Retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
