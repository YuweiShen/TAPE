This falls under the category of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and specifically, Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also involves crowd-sourcing and training of workers, which is related to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The evaluation dataset creation involves data consolidation and quality control, which is related to Information Retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses the potential for future research, which is related to Neural Networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
