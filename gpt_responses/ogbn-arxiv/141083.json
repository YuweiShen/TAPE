This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses scenarios where the service provider is interested in maximizing the sum rate over a fixed, selected number of users, which falls under the category of control and optimization (cs.SY). The use of massive MIMO technology is also a key aspect of the paper, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and communication (cs.COM) systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
