Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces a novel design for reducing redundant computation, which involves using the similarity of intermediate feature maps of consecutive frames. This design is related to machine learning and optimization, which suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper discusses the acceleration of CNNs using efficient inference engines, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper applies the proposed framework to video pose estimation and video object detection, which could suggest that it belongs to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
