Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the density of constrained versions of fan-planar drawings, which falls under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The relationship between fan-planarity and $k$-planarity, which is also discussed in the paper, is a topic in cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). Finally, the paper proves the NP-completeness of a decision problem related to fan-planarity, which is a topic in cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
