The proposed algorithm involves gamma correction, which is a common technique in multimedia processing (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the use of cumulative distribution function (CDF), which is a common tool in information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper mentions the alleviation of local over-enhancement and structure distortion, which are common concerns in graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the paper proposes an improved algorithm, which could be considered a machine learning approach (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
