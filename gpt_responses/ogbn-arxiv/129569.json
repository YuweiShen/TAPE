Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses security protocols, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of large-scale testbeds and performance measurements could also fall under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) or cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
