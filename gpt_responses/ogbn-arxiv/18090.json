The paper proposes a statistical model-based method for selecting a distance threshold, which involves iterative algorithms and task-specific constraints, indicating a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the limitations of a data-driven approach, which suggests a potential connection to cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper applies the proposed method to a large database of head motion videos, indicating a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
