The study is based on journal rankings from 2004-2014, which suggests a focus on more established sub-fields. The use of Mendeley reader counts as an alternative to citation counts suggests a focus on digital libraries (cs.DL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The discussion of stability over time suggests a focus on sub-fields with a relatively stable research landscape, such as cryptography (cs.CR), social networks (cs.SI), and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
