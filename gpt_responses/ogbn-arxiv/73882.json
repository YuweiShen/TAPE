The use of recurrent and attention-based neural models also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of LSTM gating signals, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper proposes a method for visualizing attention, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
