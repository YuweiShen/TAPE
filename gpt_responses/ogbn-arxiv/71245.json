It also discusses the performance of these codes in the presence of channel noise, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper uses techniques from probability theory and statistics to derive bounds on the performance of the codes, which are also relevant to data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses practical implementation issues, which are relevant to networking and communications (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
