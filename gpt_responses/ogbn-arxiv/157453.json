The proposed framework also involves multi-agent reinforcement learning (cs.MA) to balance resources and synchronous stochastic gradient descent (cs.NE) to reduce overhead. The resource constraint and failure by attacks mentioned in the abstract suggest a potential connection to distributed computing (cs.DC) and system and control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
