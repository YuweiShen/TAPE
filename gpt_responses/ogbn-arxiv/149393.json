This involves using the theory of smooth functions on a Riemannian manifold and Hodge theory to generate orthonormal sets of basis functions based on the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on manifolds. The resulting algorithms, called Representation Policy Iteration (RPI), learn both basis functions and approximately optimal policies. This work is likely to be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), control systems (cs.SY), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
