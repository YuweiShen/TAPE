The experiments are conducted on image classification (cs.CV), semantic segmentation (cs.CV), object detection and instance segmentation (cs.CV), and video classification (cs.CV). The paper also discusses hyper-parameter tuning and neural architecture search, which are topics related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The concept of budgeted training and resource constraints is a novel approach to deep learning optimization, which may fall under the category of neural engineering (cs.NE) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
