The use of space-time block codes and multi-antenna channels suggests a possible connection to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also proposes new alignment methods, which could be considered a form of signal processing (cs.SI). The examples of interference networks suggest a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
