This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also considers the impact of imperfect channel state information (CSI) and finite blocklength channel coding, which are relevant topics in control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, the paper uses stochastic network calculus to analyze the system performance, which is a technique commonly used in large-scale systems and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
