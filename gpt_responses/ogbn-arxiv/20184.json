The proposed method uses hierarchical features and bipartite graph algorithms to perform style transfer, which are common techniques in computer vision. \n2. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper focuses on stylizing images and videos, which is a common problem in graphics. The proposed method uses a photo stylistic brush to perform style transfer, which is a common tool in graphics. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the problem of stylizing images and videos, which is a common problem in multimedia. The proposed method uses a Superpixel-based BIpartite Graph (SuperBIG) to perform style transfer, which is a common technique in multimedia. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an automatic robust style transfer approach based on SuperBIG, which involves using machine learning techniques to perform style transfer. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an automatic robust style transfer approach based on SuperBIG, which involves using machine learning techniques to perform style transfer.
