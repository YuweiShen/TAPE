The paper specifically focuses on the impact of mini-batch size on training performance, which is relevant to both computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) applications. The experimental results are based on popular image classification datasets, such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, which are commonly used in computer vision research. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the assumptions and trade-offs of different training strategies, which is relevant to the broader field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
