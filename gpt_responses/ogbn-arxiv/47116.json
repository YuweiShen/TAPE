The use of class skew and probability layers to optimize resource consumption is a machine learning (cs.LG) technique. The paper also discusses techniques from source code optimization, which falls under computer architecture (cs.AR) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper proposes a systematic framework for selecting the most accurate architectures under a runtime resource budget, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
