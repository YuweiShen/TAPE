This involves intercepting OpenFlow messages exchanged between the control and data plane, learning the normal set of trajectories in the data plane for distinct packet headers, and verifying the data plane forwarding devices and NOS policies. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper involves the use of machine learning techniques to learn the normal set of trajectories, which suggests a possible fit with cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the role of the NOS as the brain of the network, which suggests a possible fit with cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
