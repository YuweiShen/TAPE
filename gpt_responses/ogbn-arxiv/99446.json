The evaluation of scalability and performance of P2P tools for discovering and registering services is related to network infrastructure (cs.NI). The study of protocols for creating a decentralised middleware for desktop grid involves distributed systems (cs.Distributed Systems) and operating systems (cs.OS). Finally, the analysis of publish-subscribe systems is related to system design and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
