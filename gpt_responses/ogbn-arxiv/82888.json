The use of radar sensors for this task also relates to robotics (cs.RO). The paper discusses the use of random forest and LSTM classifiers, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also discusses the issue of data imbalance, which is a problem in cybersecurity (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
