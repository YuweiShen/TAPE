The paper also proposes a generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, which involves mathematical modeling and manipulation of complex numbers, indicating a possible connection to information theory (cs.IT) and dynamical systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents an application of the proposed method in a quantum dynamical model, which suggests a potential relevance to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
