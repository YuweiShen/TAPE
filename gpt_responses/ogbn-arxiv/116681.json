This problem is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including database systems (cs.DB) for managing large-scale observational data, information retrieval (cs.IR) for searching and matching objects across different surveys, computer vision (cs.CV) for image processing and object detection, artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for developing algorithms to classify and cluster objects, and data structures (cs.DS) for efficient spatial indexing and querying."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
