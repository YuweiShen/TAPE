The paper also mentions optimization of both transformation and classifier parameters jointly, which suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper introduces an efficient cost function based on misclassification loss, which suggests that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper deals with image datasets, which suggests that it may belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper presents experiments on several image datasets, which suggests that it may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
