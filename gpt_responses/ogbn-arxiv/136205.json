This involves robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques for tracking pedestrians and predicting their future positions. The algorithm also uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (cs.AI) for collision avoidance and policy generation. The paper also discusses the generalization of the approach to real-world scenarios, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and system engineering (cs.SY) considerations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
