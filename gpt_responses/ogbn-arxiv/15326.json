The use of graph operations to identify restricted classes of digraphs where the problem is solvable in polynomial time suggests that the paper may belong to the categories of data structures (cs.DS), logic in computer science (cs.LO), graph theory (cs.GT), computational complexity (cs.CC), or computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
