The method involves training a gating branch using the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the method, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper provides an efficient CUDA implementation of the method, which is a topic in computer systems and architecture (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
