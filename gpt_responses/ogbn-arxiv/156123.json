This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with systems and control (cs.SY), as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) in the context of building performance models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
