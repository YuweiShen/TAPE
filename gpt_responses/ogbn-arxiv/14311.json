The use of low-precision training can also be relevant to other sub-fields of AI (cs.AI) such as natural language processing and robotics. The paper specifically mentions the use of low-precision training for computer vision tasks (cs.CV), which is a popular application area for neural networks. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of fused-kernel approaches to reduce simulator overhead, which is a technique that is commonly used in numerical optimization (cs.NE) and high-performance computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
