This involves explicit learning, which is a key area of research in artificial intelligence. \n2. cs.LG - The paper involves the use of machine learning techniques, specifically Bayesian networks, to implement explicit learning in the nurse scheduling problem. This falls under the category of machine learning, which is a subfield of computer science. \n3. cs.DS - The paper involves the use of data structures and algorithms to solve the nurse scheduling problem. This falls under the category of data structures, which is a subfield of computer science. \n4. cs.RO - The paper involves the use of optimization techniques to solve the nurse scheduling problem.
