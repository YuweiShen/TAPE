The use of ontology-based approaches also suggests a connection to information retrieval (cs.IR) and knowledge representation (cs.LG). Finally, the focus on improving the accuracy of machine translation aligns with the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
