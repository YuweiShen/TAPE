This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also involves experimentation and comparison with state-of-the-art methods, which falls under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. The use of co-occurrence texture patterns and modified color histograms involves some level of machine learning (cs.MM) and statistical learning (cs.LG). Finally, the proposed method involves improving existing descriptors, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
