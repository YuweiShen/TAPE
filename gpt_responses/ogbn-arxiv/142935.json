The use of Benders decomposition is a technique commonly used in optimization problems in control systems (cs.SY). The paper also deals with multiple-antenna transmitters and receivers, which is a topic related to MIMO systems (cs.MM). Finally, the optimization approaches discussed in the paper can be considered as machine learning techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
