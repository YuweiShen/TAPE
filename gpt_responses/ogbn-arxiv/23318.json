This suggests that the paper belongs to the category of Computation and Language (cs.CL). The paper also discusses various strategies for adapting pre-trained embeddings, which falls under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes using a large, topic-rich source corpus (such as Wikipedia) to augment the limited corpus, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
