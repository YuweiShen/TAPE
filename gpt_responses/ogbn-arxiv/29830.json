The use of planar graphs and regular graphs suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.GT). The mention of moderately exponential-time algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
