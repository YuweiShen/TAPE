Therefore, cs.SE (Software Engineering) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the implementation of the approach as an add-in for Microsoft Excel, which involves programming language concepts and techniques, making cs.PL (Programming Languages) another likely sub-category. The approach involves executing user-defined test rules, which can be seen as a form of database testing, making cs.DB (Databases) a possible sub-category. The paper also evaluates the approach with end-users and computer science students, which suggests a focus on human-computer interaction, making cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the potential use of the approach for business-critical spreadsheets, which suggests a focus on cybersecurity, making cs.CY (Cryptography and Security) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
