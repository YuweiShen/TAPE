The algorithm proposed in the paper involves restricting the search space, which is a technique commonly used in data mining (cs.DM) and databases (cs.DB). The paper also evaluates the algorithm on both synthetic and real-life data, which is a common practice in the field of statistics and machine learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
