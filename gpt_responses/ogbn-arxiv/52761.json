This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses power allocation and optimization, which are relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). The use of multiple antennas and distributed beamforming is a key aspect of the paper, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
