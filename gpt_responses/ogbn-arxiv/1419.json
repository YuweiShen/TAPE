The paper also mentions the use of random feature maps, which is a technique commonly used in kernel-based algorithms. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses the empirical performance of the proposed approach on real-world datasets, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-categories cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
