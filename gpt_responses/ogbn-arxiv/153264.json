The use of \"lazy\" labels to reduce the need for pixel-wise annotation is a novel approach that could be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of the method to food microscopy images suggests that it could also be relevant to researchers in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) who work with image analysis in the context of food science or biology."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
