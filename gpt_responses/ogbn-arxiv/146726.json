The paper also discusses the number of bends required for such drawings, which is related to graph theory (cs.DS, cs.GT). Additionally, the paper mentions the grid-size required for straight-line drawings, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper discusses the practical applications of non-aligned drawings, which could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
