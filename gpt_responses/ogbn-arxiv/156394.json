The paper also discusses weighted voting games, which are a common topic in game theory. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a probabilistic approach to analyze the distribution of Shapley values in weighted voting games. This involves the use of stochastic processes and renewal theory, which are topics commonly studied in algorithms and data structures. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The Shapley-Shubik value is often used in the context of machine learning and AI, particularly in the field of explainable AI. The paper's focus on analyzing the distribution of Shapley values in a probabilistic setting is also relevant to AI research. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The Shapley-Shubik value is a concept that is often used in machine learning, particularly in the context of feature importance and model interpretability. The paper's focus on analyzing the distribution of Shapley values is also relevant to machine learning research. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Weighted voting games are often used to model decision-making processes in social networks, and the Shapley-Shubik value is a commonly used measure of voting power in such"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
