The paper also explores the use of neural models for this task, which falls under the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of auxiliary tasks to improve the consistency of generated FOL, which is a common technique in neural network training (cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions the release of a large-scale FOL dataset, which could be of interest to researchers in the field of cryptography (cs.CR) who work on formal verification and logical reasoning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
