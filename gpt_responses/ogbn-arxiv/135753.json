This involves modeling the interdependence of actions between traffic participants and learning policies over and within macro-actions. These concepts are commonly associated with artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the use of machine learning to learn policies falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
