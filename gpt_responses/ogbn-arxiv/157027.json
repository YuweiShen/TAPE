This task is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, and machine learning. Based on the abstract, the paper proposes a novel method for CS detection using language posteriors generated by a CS automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. This approach is expected to yield more accurate and robust CS detection compared to the time alignment of the ASR output. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.SD (Sound), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SD (Speech and Audio Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
