The method uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for interaction and propagation, which are core operations in CV. The paper also proposes a new multi-round training scheme for the interactive video object segmentation, which involves machine learning (ML) and optimization techniques. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also involves deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in AI research, and ML techniques, which are used for training and optimization. Therefore, the next likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nThe paper focuses on video object segmentation, which is a subfield of multimedia (MM) research. Therefore, cs.MM (Multimedia) is also a likely sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper involves user interaction, which is a common theme in robotics (RO) research. Therefore, cs.RO (Robotics) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
