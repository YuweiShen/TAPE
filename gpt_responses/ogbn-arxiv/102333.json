The problem is parameterized, and the paper investigates its complexity with respect to several well-studied graph parameters, such as treewidth, pathwidth, tree-depth, and feedback vertex set, which are all topics in computational complexity (cs.CC) and graph theory (cs.DS, cs.GT). The paper also considers the problem's approximability, which is a common topic in approximation algorithms (cs.CG). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DM, cs.CC, cs.DS, cs.GT, and cs.CG, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
