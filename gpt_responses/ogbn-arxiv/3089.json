The use of a sentence-level classifier suggests a focus on natural language understanding (cs.CL), while the application to computer vision and machine comprehension suggests relevance to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The release of benchmark datasets and comparison with a state-of-the-art classifier also suggests relevance to machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
