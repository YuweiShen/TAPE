The proposed method involves introducing new blocks into existing deep learning pipelines, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments are performed on image datasets, which also suggests the possibility of multimedia (cs.MM) being a relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of a gradient-boosting loss function, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
