Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Additionally, the paper discusses caching, batching, and adaptive model selection techniques, which are related to data management and optimization, suggesting cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper introduces a modular architecture to simplify model deployment, which is related to software engineering, indicating cs.SE (Software Engineering) as a less likely but still possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
