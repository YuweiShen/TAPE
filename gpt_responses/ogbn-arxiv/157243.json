The focus on subspace designs and rank-metric codes also suggests a connection to coding theory, which is a subfield of information theory. Additionally, the use of tensoring and dimension expanders suggests a connection to computational geometry and complexity theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
