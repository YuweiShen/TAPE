This involves applying machine learning to directly improve relaxation bounds obtained by general-purpose bounding mechanisms for combinatorial optimization problems. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
