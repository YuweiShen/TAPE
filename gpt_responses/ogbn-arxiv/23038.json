The paper proposes new ORAM constructions that reduce the database space overhead, which is critical for big-data processing. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes new ORAM constructions that maintain state-of-the-art performance in terms of access overhead and user space. This involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms for secure database access. \n3. cs.DB (Databases) - The paper discusses the use of ORAM for secure database access, which is a topic related to databases. The proposed ORAM constructions aim to reduce the space complexity of the database, which is important for big-data applications. \n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the space complexity of ORAM constructions and proposes new constructions that reduce the space overhead. This is a topic related to computational complexity. \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper proposes new ORAM constructions and provides non-asymptotic analyses and simulation results to show their practical effectiveness. This involves applying information theory to analyze and evaluate the proposed constructions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
