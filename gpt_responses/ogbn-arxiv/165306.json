This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to the computer vision sub-category.\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper introduces an auto-encoder based model to construct a multimodal joint embedding space between the visual and textual manifolds. This involves the use of machine learning techniques and hence, it is likely to belong to this sub-category.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with videos and textual embeddings, which are both forms of multimedia. Hence, it is likely to belong to this sub-category.\n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper uses GloVe word embeddings for the textual side of the model. This is a clear indication that the paper deals with language processing and hence, it is likely to belong to this sub-category.\n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper evaluates the zero-shot recognition results using top-n accuracy and measures the manifold learning ability using mean Nearest Neighbor Overlap. These are both metrics commonly used in information retrieval tasks and hence, it is likely to belong to this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
