This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) as well as information retrieval (cs.IR) since the extracted semantic structures can be used for document indexing and retrieval. The paper also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) since the network classifies pixels based on the content of underlying text. The use of synthetic data for pretraining the network and the semi-supervised approach for fine-tuning suggest the involvement of machine learning (cs.LG) and deep learning (cs.DL) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
