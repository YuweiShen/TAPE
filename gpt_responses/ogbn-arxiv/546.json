This work is related to computer vision (cs.CV) as it focuses on image classification on the ImageNet dataset. It also involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it deals with deep neural networks and optimizing accuracy. Additionally, it involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it proposes an algorithm for automated network simplification. The use of empirical measurements to evaluate direct metrics also suggests a connection to neural engineering (cs.NE). Finally, the adaptation of neural networks to a specific platform suggests a connection to computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
