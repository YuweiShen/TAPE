It specifically focuses on the use of multiple antennas (MIMO) in this channel, which is a subfield of wireless communication (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the use of codebooks and zero-forcing schemes, which are common in signal processing and coding (cs.MM). The concept of diversity gain is also mentioned, which is a topic in network information theory (cs.NI).
