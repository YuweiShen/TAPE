The paper also discusses the issue of occlusion, which is a common problem in graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO). The proposed method involves using a predicted silhouette to guide the reconstruction process, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
