The paper proposes an automatic optimization-based nearest neighbor matching approach for text normalization. This approach involves a similarity function that incorporates contextual, string, and phonetic similarity, and the nearest neighbor matching involves a minimum similarity threshold. These techniques are commonly used in NLP, which suggests that this paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category covers topics related to NLP, including text normalization. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category covers topics related to search engines and information retrieval, which can benefit from text normalization. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers topics related to machine learning, which is often used in NLP tasks. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers topics related to AI, which includes NLP. \n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): This sub-category covers topics related to software development, which can include developing tools for text normalization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
