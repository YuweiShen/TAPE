This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The concept of vehicle platooning is often associated with autonomous vehicles and robotics. The paper's focus on control policies for vehicle platoons could be relevant to the robotics community.\n- cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): Vehicle platooning involves multiple agents (vehicles) interacting with each other. The paper's approach to achieving string stability in the presence of disturbances could be relevant to the multiagent systems community.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper's approach to controlling vehicle platoons could be seen as an application of artificial intelligence techniques to the field of transportation.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, but the concept of using data-driven approaches to control vehicle platoons could be relevant to the machine learning community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
