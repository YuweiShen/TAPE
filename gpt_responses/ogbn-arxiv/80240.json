This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) category. The paper also proposes a novel deep learning architecture that incorporates Lie group structure, which is a mathematical concept related to group theory. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE) categories. Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on standard datasets, which indicates that it may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
