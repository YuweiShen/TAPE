The paper also discusses communication complexity, which is a common topic in the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) and Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper presents new protocols with improved efficiency, which could fall under the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category.
