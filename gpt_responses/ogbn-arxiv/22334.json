The paper also discusses fitting a 3D layout, which falls under computer graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper proposes extended annotations for the Matterport3D dataset, which involves multimedia (cs.MM) techniques. Finally, the paper discusses the impact of design decisions on the performance of the methods, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
