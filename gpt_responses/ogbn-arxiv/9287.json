This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG) as well as numerical analysis (cs.NA) and data structures (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses implications of the results for the Stable Sparse Recovery problem which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
