The approach proposed in the paper involves training on noisy candidate labels and regularizing through early stopping, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the noise generated through the label collection process, which is related to natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper uses datasets such as ImageNet and CIFAR-10, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
