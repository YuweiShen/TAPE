It also involves the construction of codes, which falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS). The concept of cut-set bound is related to network coding, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the node size of codes, which is a topic in systems and control (cs.SI). Finally, the repair of multiple failed nodes involves the study of network protocols, which is a topic in networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
