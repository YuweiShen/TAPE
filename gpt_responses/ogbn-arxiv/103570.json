The paper also discusses the equivalence of ResNet and DenseNet, which are both deep learning models and fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed Dual Path Network also involves exploring new features, which is related to neural evolution (cs.NE). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
