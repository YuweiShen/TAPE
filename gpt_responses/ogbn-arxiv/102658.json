The proposed approach involves using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) representations in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The paper also discusses the accommodation of domain stochasticity, which is relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
