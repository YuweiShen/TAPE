It could also belong to the Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) sub-category as it discusses the importance of reliable and easy-to-use software packages for scientific research. The Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper presents a project skeleton for software development. The Modeling and Simulation (cs.MS) sub-category is relevant as the paper discusses the development of sustainable software packages for scientific research. Finally, the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category is a possibility as the paper may discuss the use of software packages in these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
