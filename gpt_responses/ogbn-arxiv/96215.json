The use of completeness information and indexing techniques also suggests relevance to information retrieval (cs.IR) and scalable data processing (cs.SI). Finally, the development of a tool for reasoning about completeness of query answers over RDF data aligns with the sub-category of deep learning (cs.DL) which involves developing tools for reasoning and decision-making."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
