The focus is on synchronization of parameters, which is a key challenge in distributed training. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also mentions click-through-rate prediction, which is a common application in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
