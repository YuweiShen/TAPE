It may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as SVMs are commonly used in AI applications. Additionally, the paper mentions experiments on image classification, which suggests it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). The use of stochastic optimization methods suggests it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
