The paper also mentions the use of a Genetic Algorithm for optimisation, which is a common technique in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of leg performance in a simulator involves control systems, which falls under the subfield of Systems and Control (cs.SY). The use of 3D-printable files and the emphasis on shape optimisation suggests a potential overlap with Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) subfields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
