The paper also introduces a new principle for optimal communication and provides a unified framework for feedback communication, which are topics in machine learning and optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), followed by cs.COMM (Communication and Networking), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
