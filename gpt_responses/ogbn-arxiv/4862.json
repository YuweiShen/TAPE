The use of kernel regression and joint saliency maps suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The focus on local structures and deformations also suggests that the paper may be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the use of block matching and iterative regression suggests that the paper may also be relevant to graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
