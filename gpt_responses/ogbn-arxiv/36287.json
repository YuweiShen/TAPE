The use of the existential theory of the reals to prove hardness suggests a connection to algebraic geometry and computational complexity (cs.DS, cs.CC). The paper also discusses the complexity of the problem for simply connected regions, which is related to topological graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper presents results on the coordinates required for the drawing, which could be of interest to researchers in computational geometry and graph theory (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
