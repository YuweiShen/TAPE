Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper involves information retrieval (IR) techniques for sampling informative negative examples, which suggests cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as another likely sub-category. The paper also presents a neural model and discusses the use of embeddings, which are common topics in the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper deals with large-scale datasets, which could be relevant to the sub-category of cs.DB (Databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
