This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.IR sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of neural network-based IR models, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.CL sub-category. The paper also deals with real-time information and emergency events, which could potentially place it in the cs.SI sub-category.
