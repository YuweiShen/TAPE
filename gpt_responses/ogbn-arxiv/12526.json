It also proposes a novel routing algorithm and a different training algorithm to implement the $\\gamma$-capsule networks. Additionally, the paper provides a theoretical framework with formal definitions and metrics for evaluation, which are commonly used in computer vision research. The paper may also belong to the neural networks (cs.NE), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories as these fields are closely related to computer vision and may also benefit from the proposed inductive bias and routing algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
