The use of local observers and parameter estimators suggests a focus on multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The changing neighbor graph is a key aspect of the problem, which could be relevant to research on dynamic networks (cs.DC) and networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the use of recursive algorithms and control theory techniques could also make this paper relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
