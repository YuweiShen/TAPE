This involves learning a representation of sub-goals in the environment and a low-level policy to execute them. The paper evaluates the proposed method on Mazebase and Mujoco environments, which are commonly used in the fields of machine learning and robotics. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
