The paper also discusses domain adaptation techniques, which fall under cs.LG and cs.AI. The use of anchor tasks, such as semantic segmentation and facial landmarks, suggests a possible connection to graphics and visualization (cs.GR). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed methods on image datasets suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
