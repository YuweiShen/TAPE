The use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to predict head movement positions is a technique that falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the application of the proposed approach to generate heat maps of potential head movement positions is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
