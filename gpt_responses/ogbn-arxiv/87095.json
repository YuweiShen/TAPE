The presence of altmetrics is analyzed in fields such as social sciences, humanities, medical and life sciences, which are covered by sub-categories such as cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.CY (Computational Biology and Bioinformatics), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential value of altmetrics as a complementary tool for research evaluation, which is relevant to various sub-fields within computer science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
