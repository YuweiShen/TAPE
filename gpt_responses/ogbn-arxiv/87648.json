This falls under the sub-category of Programming Languages (cs.PL). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of structural operational semantics, which is a formal method for describing the behavior of programs, and this falls under the sub-category of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). The paper also discusses the modularity of the framework, which is a software engineering concept, and this could fall under the sub-category of Software Engineering (cs.SE). The paper also discusses the use of delimited control operators, which is a topic in functional programming, and this could fall under the sub-category of Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL). Finally, the paper discusses the expressiveness of the framework, which is a theoretical concept, and this could fall under the sub-category of Theoretical Computer Science (cs.THEORY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
