The paper also discusses the use of different embedding models and cross-lingual biases, which are relevant to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The analysis of biases across languages and corpora may also be relevant to the sub-category of Cybersecurity (cs.CY), as biases in NLP can have implications for privacy and security. Finally, the paper's focus on bias reduction techniques may be relevant to the sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), as biases in NLP can have social implications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
