The paper also proposes an optimization algorithm for joint trajectory and resource allocation, which involves control systems (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Finally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of the proposed designs through simulation results, which is related to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
