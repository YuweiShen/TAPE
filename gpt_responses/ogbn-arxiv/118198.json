This makes it likely to belong to the Game Theory (cs.GT) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories, which often deal with algorithmic and computational aspects of voting and preference aggregation problems. The paper also proposes a general algorithmic framework that can be used with any score function, which makes it relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also studies the complexity of the problem for monotone submodular score functions, which makes it relevant to the Data Structures (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with fairness constraints with respect to multiple, non-disjoint attributes, which makes it relevant to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
