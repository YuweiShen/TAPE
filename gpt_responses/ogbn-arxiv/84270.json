This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the transmission framework and the use of uncoordinated network operation to support reliable communication, which could also fall under the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of directional narrow-beam transmissions, which could fall under the Augmented Reality (cs.AR) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of simulations to validate the proposed transmission scheme, which could fall under the Computation and Language (cs.COM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
