The use of skip-connections suggests that it may also be relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Additionally, the mention of generalization error estimates and reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) suggests that it may be relevant to the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
