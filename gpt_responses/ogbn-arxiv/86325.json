The addition of uncertainty in agents' preferences makes it relevant to topics such as decision making under uncertainty (cs.DS) and probabilistic reasoning (cs.LG). The paper also presents algorithmic and complexity results, which are relevant to the subfield of computational complexity (cs.CC) and optimization (cs.OH). However, since the focus is on social choice and matching with uncertain preferences, we consider cs.GT and cs.AI to be the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
