The paper also discusses the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency in finite-precision arithmetic computations, which is a key concern in numerical analysis. \n\n2. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper presents a technique that combines rewriting and mixed-precision tuning to optimize the performance of finite-precision programs. This involves manipulating the program's syntax and semantics, which is a core topic in programming languages. \n\n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a fully automated and sound technique and tool for optimizing the performance of floating-point and fixed-point arithmetic kernels. This involves developing software tools and techniques, which is a core topic in software engineering. \n\n4. cs.AR (Architecture): The paper discusses the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency in finite-precision arithmetic computations, which is a key concern in computer architecture. The paper also presents a technique for optimizing the performance of finite-precision programs, which is relevant to computer architecture. \n\n5. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper presents a technique that combines rewriting and mixed-precision tuning to optimize the performance of finite-precision programs.
