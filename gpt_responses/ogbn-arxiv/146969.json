This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The specific type of feedback considered in the paper is discriminative feature feedback, which involves identifying important features that distinguish between pairs of instances. This is relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV) tasks, where identifying discriminative features can be crucial for accurate classification. Finally, the paper also discusses the handling of errors made by the annotator, which is a problem in the field of data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
