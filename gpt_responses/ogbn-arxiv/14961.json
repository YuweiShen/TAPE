This falls under the scope of human-computer interaction research.\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper mentions social networks (e.g. Twitter) as one of the information networks that can be modeled using graphs. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the study of social and information networks.\n3. cs.DB (Databases): The paper proposes efficient graph aggregation algorithms for multiple subgraphs via computation sharing. This is a common problem in database research, where efficient algorithms for data aggregation are often studied.\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses how graph aggregation techniques can be integrated into the exploring framework as consolidated information for users. This is similar to the concept of information retrieval, where relevant information is extracted and presented to users.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes new algorithms for graph aggregation and exploration. This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
