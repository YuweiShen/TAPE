This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) as it involves analyzing and interpreting visual data (full-body joint angles). The paper also discusses the interpretation of the DNNs, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper focuses on clinical biomechanics and medical diagnoses, which falls under bioinformatics (cs.BIO) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper discusses the use of Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) technique, which is a neural network interpretability method and falls under neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
