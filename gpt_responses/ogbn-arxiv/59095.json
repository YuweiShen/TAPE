The use of semantic segmentation to improve the performance of multi-camera systems is also a key aspect of the paper, which suggests that it could be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the optimization technique used to improve the 2D detections of each camera could be considered as a robotics-related topic, which could place the paper under cs.RO (Robotics). The use of semantic information to improve detection performance could also be seen as an application of machine learning, which could place the paper under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the fact that the paper deals with video surveillance scenarios suggests that it could also be categorized under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
