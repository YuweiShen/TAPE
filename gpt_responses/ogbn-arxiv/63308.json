The methodology involves the use of high-dimensional regression techniques to map a large set of features produced by the surrogate model to a prediction of the surrogate-model error in a quantity of interest. The paper also applies the proposed framework to model errors in reduced-order models of nonlinear oil--water subsurface flow simulations. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
