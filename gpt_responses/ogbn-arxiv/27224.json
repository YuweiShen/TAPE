The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the self-attention module and proposes a more efficient implementation, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper explores the principles behind the module, which could be related to neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
