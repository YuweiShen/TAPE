These problems are commonly studied in computational geometry (cs.CG) and have connections to optimization (cs.DS, cs.NA), data mining (cs.DM), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of convex duality and non-smooth optimization techniques, which are relevant to optimization and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CG, followed by cs.DS, cs.NA, cs.DM, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
