The use of gaze as a primary input for segmentation also suggests a human-computer interaction (cs.HC) aspect. The dataset used in the paper contains videos depicting daily-living activities, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) category. The paper also discusses the use of entropy measures to improve the quality of temporal cuts, which is a machine learning (cs.LG) technique. Finally, the task of content-based video retrieval, which can benefit from unsupervised segmentation, is related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
