Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval). \n\nThe paper also leverages pre-trained language models, which falls under the sub-category of natural language processing (NLP). Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is also a likely sub-category. \n\nThe proposed approach involves transfer learning, which is a common technique in machine learning (ML). Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is another likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of deep learning models, which falls under the sub-category of artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also a possible sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper involves the use of multilingual data, which falls under the sub-category of computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR).
