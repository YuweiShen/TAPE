This involves constructing hypotheses for metric approximations which generalize to unseen samples under certain assumptions of learnability of distance threshold functions. This work involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, which are typically covered in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with fairness and bias, which are relevant to the cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a solution to a practical problem, which is relevant to the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
