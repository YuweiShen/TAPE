The focus is on maximizing information collected and learning a spatiotemporal environmental model. This involves techniques such as informative planning, sparse Gaussian Process, and online learning. These techniques are commonly used in robotics (cs.RO), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and control systems (cs.SY). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
