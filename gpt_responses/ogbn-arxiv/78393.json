This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) category. The paper also uses deep convolutional neural networks (cs.MM) and incorporates contextual information from body poses (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper addresses the problem of improving detection performance (cs.LG) and discusses the potential applications in e-commerce (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
