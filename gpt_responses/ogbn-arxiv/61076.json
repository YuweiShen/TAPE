The proposed method involves forming local meshes around each voxel and using functional connectivity matrices to estimate the relationship between voxels within a mesh. The resulting Functional Connectivity aware Local Relational Features (FC-LRF) are then used to train a statistical learning machine. This paper involves machine learning, neural networks, and image processing, which are all sub-categories of computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
