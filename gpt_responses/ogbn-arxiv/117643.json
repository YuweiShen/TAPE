These techniques are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing (cs.CL) in the form of textual descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on image datasets (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
