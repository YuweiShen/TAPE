Specifically, it proposes a multitask learning network that uses a deep convolution neural network for feature embedding, recurrent neural network modules for temporal dynamic modeling, and linear models for final estimation. The paper also discusses the use of group lasso and phase-guided constraints to model intra- and inter-task relatedness. Given this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
