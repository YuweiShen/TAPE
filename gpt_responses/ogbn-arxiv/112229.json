The proposed algorithm uses graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) to parametrize policies for the robots, which involves machine learning techniques such as deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the scalability of the proposed method, which is related to systems and control (cs.SY) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
