This involves using a Bayesian neural network with a Horseshoe prior to discard redundant input variables. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers topics related to the design and analysis of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. The proposed method involves using a hierarchical latent variable model with sparsity, which is a common topic in machine learning research. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers topics related to the development of intelligent agents that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve goals. The proposed method involves modeling time series data, which is a common task in AI research. \n- cs.ST (Statistics): This sub-category covers topics related to the theory and application of statistical methods. The proposed method involves using Bayesian variational inference, which is a statistical method. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category covers topics related to the quantification, storage, and communication of information. The proposed method involves modeling time series data, which can be seen as a form of information. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This sub-category covers topics related to the analysis and modeling of social and information networks."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
