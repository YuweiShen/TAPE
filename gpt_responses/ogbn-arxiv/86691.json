This involves the use of core-sets, a technique from computational geometry for handling streaming data via data summarization. The paper focuses on the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm, which is a classic algorithm used in BCI applications. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper involves processing EEG signals, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
