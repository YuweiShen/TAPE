The use of deep neural networks and optimization techniques also suggests that it could be classified under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the robustness of the generated adversarial examples, which could be relevant to the computer security (cs.CR) sub-category.
