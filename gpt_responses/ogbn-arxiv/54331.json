The tool uses machine learning techniques to suggest which source code files should be inspected next, which involves active learning (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the tool's performance on Mozilla Firefox vulnerability data, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The tool uses support vector machines, which is a machine learning algorithm (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses ways to further reduce the cost of vulnerability detection, which involves programming languages and compilers (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
