The method proposed in the paper leverages external knowledge in the form of knowledge graphs, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The joint ranking of items and knowledge graph entities is a typical problem in database systems (cs.DB). Finally, the use of natural language processing techniques to generate explanations is a common task in computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
