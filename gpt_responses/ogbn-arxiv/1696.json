The paper specifically focuses on Hebbian plasticity, which is a type of synaptic plasticity, and includes a model of synaptic competition. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the computational interpretations of Hebbian excitation and anti-Hebbian inhibition, which are relevant to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper's focus on sensory features and object parts suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
