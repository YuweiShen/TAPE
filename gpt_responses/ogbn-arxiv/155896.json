The paper combines ideas from reinforcement learning, program synthesis, and deep learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, the paper also discusses the interpretability and formal verification of programmatic policies, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
