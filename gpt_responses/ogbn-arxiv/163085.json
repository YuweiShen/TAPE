This is a software engineering challenge. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses formal methods and logic to verify the correctness of the MCM and to uncover under-specifications and potential inefficiencies in the RISC-V ISA documentation. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with verifying the correctness of a hardware-software system, which falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
