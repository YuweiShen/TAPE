The use of structured least squares (SLS) also suggests that the paper may be relevant to the sub-category of optimization and control (cs.SI). Finally, the use of tensor-based ESPRIT algorithms may also make the paper relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
