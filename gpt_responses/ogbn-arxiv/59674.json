The paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). The problem of edit ordering of images is related to cryptography and security (cs.CR), as it involves identifying the sequence of transformations applied to an image. The paper also mentions the use of deep learning-based approaches, which is a popular topic in information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
