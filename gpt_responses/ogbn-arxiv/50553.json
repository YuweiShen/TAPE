The algorithm used in the paper involves finite automata, which is a topic in formal languages (cs.FL). The paper also discusses the use of class equivalence, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper involves the study of combinatorial structures, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC) and logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
