The use of directional antennas and adjustable beam configurations also falls under the category of millimeter-wave communication (cs.MM). The proposed centralized scheme involves optimizing power and beam configurations, which can be seen as a control system (cs.SY) problem. Finally, the use of simulated annealing as a heuristic for solving the optimization problem involves elements of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
