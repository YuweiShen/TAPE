This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as well as machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT). The proposed defense mechanisms also incorporate system-level considerations, which could fall under systems and control (cs.SY) or networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
