This involves analyzing system execution and behavior over a long period of time to identify anomalous activities. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): This sub-category deals with the development of secure systems and the detection of security threats. The paper's focus on APT detection makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the development of intelligent systems that can learn and adapt to new situations. The paper's use of machine learning techniques to model system behavior makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category deals with the development of efficient algorithms and data structures for processing large amounts of data. The paper's use of graph analysis techniques to explore provenance graphs makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): This sub-category deals with the development of software systems and the management of software projects. The paper's focus on developing a new APT detection system makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n- cs.DB (Databases): This sub-category deals with the development of database systems and the management of large amounts of data.
