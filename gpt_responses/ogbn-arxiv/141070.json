Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses security issues related to routing protocols, which could place it in the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of sensor networks in smart cities, which could place it in the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) or cs.SY (Systems and Control) categories.
