The alternating channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT) is a key aspect of the paper, which could also place it under the networked information (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also involves interference management (cs.SI) and channel coding (cs.CC) techniques. Finally, the paper could be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) applications that require efficient communication networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
