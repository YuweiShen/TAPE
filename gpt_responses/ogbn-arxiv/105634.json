This involves designing hardware architecture for efficient computation and storage of weights in ReRAM crossbars. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper deals with training deep neural networks and optimizing their sparsity for efficient deployment on ReRAM-based accelerators. \n- cs.ET (Embedded Systems): The paper discusses the practical deployment of ReRAM-based DNN accelerators on end devices with limited chip area and power budget, which is a key concern in embedded systems. \n- cs.EM (Electromagnetics): The paper briefly mentions the use of ReRAM crossbars for analog computation, which involves the manipulation of electromagnetic fields. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with designing efficient systems for deep neural network computation and optimization, which is relevant to the systems and control subcategory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
