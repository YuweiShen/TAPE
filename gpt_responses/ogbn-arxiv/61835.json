The paper proposes an unsupervised method for this task, which involves clustering texts based on their linguistic features and then using a voting scheme to determine the correct labels for the clusters. This method is likely to be of interest to researchers working in several sub-fields of computer science, including computational linguistics (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
