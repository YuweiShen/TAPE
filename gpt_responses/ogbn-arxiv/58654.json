The focus is on addressing challenges in unconstrained face detection, such as arbitrary pose variations and occlusions. Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) are less likely categories, but they could be relevant due to the use of image features and the need for efficient detection methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
