Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to make the network flexible and scalable, which falls under the sub-category of cs.IT (Information Theory). \n\nFurthermore, the paper discusses the use of Fog computing to bring intelligence to the edge, which falls under the sub-category of cs.COMM (Communication and Networking). \n\nThe paper also discusses the characteristics specific to rural areas, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.AR (Architecture). \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the potential for standardization of the proposed Frugal 5G Network architecture, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
