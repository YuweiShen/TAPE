The paper also discusses ordering characterizations and recognition algorithms, which are topics that are often studied in the areas of graph theory (cs.DS) and theoretical computer science (cs.GT). Finally, the paper proposes a new class of digraphs called signed-interval digraphs, which could potentially fall under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
