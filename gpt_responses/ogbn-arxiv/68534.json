The use of number theory in the algorithms suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT). The paper also mentions weak abelian periods, which is a problem in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The quadratic time complexity of the algorithms suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper's focus on abelian periodicity of strings suggests a connection to formal languages (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
