This involves optimizing the selection of beam pair to minimize the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for AoD estimation. These concepts are closely related to information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with beam tracking in mmWave-band communications, which is a key technology for 5G and beyond wireless networks. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with mmWave-band communications, which is a key technology for high-speed multimedia applications. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new beam training approach that can reduce the training overhead in mobility scenarios. This involves optimizing the selection of beam pair to minimize the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for AoD estimation, which is a control problem. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): The paper does not directly deal with social or ethical issues, but it is related to the development of new technologies that can have a significant impact on society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
