Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper discusses various kinds of word embeddings and debiasing techniques, which are related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.AI another likely sub-category. The use of pretrained word embeddings and the hubness problem also suggest cs.LG (Machine Learning) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on multimodal models and their performance improvement indicates cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.MM (Multimedia) as potential sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
