This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The proposed framework and metrics for evaluating the quality of embeddings also involve machine learning techniques such as hierarchical clustering and dimensionality reduction, which are commonly used in the field of machine learning (cs.LG). Information retrieval (cs.IR) is also relevant as the paper discusses the semantic patterns in the embedding space. Finally, the use of ontological concepts suggests a potential overlap with database systems (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
