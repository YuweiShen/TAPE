The preprocessing algorithms presented in the paper involve removing certain substructures from the input graphs, which is a common technique in graph algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the structure of the common graph and its biconnected components, which is related to graph theory (cs.GT) and graph drawing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions the SPQR-tree, which is a data structure used in graph drawing and planarity testing (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
