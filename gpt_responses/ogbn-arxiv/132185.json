The use of distributional RL algorithms and deep learning techniques suggests that the paper may also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The vision-based aspect of the grasping tasks suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) may also be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses risk management in RL, which suggests that the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
