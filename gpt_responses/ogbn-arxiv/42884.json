The use of socialbots and sentiment analysis to investigate the influence of social media on human rights abuse reports suggests that this paper could be categorized under cs.SI (social and information networks) and cs.CL (computation and language). Additionally, the proposed adaptations for Spanish-speaking bot detection could fall under cs.CY (computers and society) and cs.CR (cryptography and security). Finally, the use of empirical online social network data could also place this paper under cs.SD (software development and programming)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
