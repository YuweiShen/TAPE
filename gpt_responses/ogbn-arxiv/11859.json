This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence. \n2. cs.SY - The paper deals with the scheduling of EVs and their integration with the power grid, which is a system-level problem. This falls under the scope of systems and control. \n3. cs.LG - The paper employs Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO), which is a general-purpose optimization algorithm. This falls under the scope of machine learning and optimization. \n4. cs.DC - The paper deals with the integration of EVs with the power grid, which involves the management of distributed energy resources. This falls under the scope of distributed computing. \n5. cs.SE - The paper proposes a new formulation for joint scheduling of EV and Unit Commitment, which involves software engineering aspects such as algorithm design and simulation.
