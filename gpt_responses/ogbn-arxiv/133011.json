The paper discusses channel fading and interference, which are key impairments in wireless communication. The paper proposes two protocols for interference mitigation, one based on interference cancellation and the other based on interference avoidance. The paper also discusses the scalability of the proposed protocols in terms of bandwidth required for achieving ultrareliability. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other likely sub-categories include cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
