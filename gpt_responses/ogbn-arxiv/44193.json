This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper uses stochastic bandit theory to address the small base station transmit power assignment problem. This falls under the domain of information theory. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes power assignment algorithms based on Bayesian principles and bandit learning. This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with the problem of setting the base station transmit power to guarantee good performance and user experience. This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes a learning-based approach to solve the small cell transmit power assignment problem.
