The use of meta-learning strategy and semantic segmentation module also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The proposed regularization method based on multi-split matching could also indicate a potential connection to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the construction of new datasets and evaluation of the proposed method on them could suggest a possible connection to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
