The use of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) also suggests a potential fit for multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Additionally, the paper discusses open issues related to DCNNs for face verification, which could also be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
