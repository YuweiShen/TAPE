Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a new building block for CNNs, which involves constructing hierarchical residual-like connections, indicating a potential fit for the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the paper evaluates the Res2Net block on various backbone CNN models, demonstrating consistent performance gains, suggesting a possible fit for the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, indicating a potential fit for the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. Finally, the paper provides source code and trained models, indicating a possible fit for the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
