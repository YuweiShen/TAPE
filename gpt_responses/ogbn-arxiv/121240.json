The use of Boolean satisfiability and Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS). The application of the decision procedure for verifying pipelined microprocessors suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
