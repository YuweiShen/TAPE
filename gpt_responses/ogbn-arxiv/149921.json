This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture, making cs.NI the most likely sub-category.\n\n2. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) - The proposed approach involves parked cars making decisions based on received signal strength, which can be seen as a form of multiagent systems. Therefore, cs.MA is a likely sub-category.\n\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the use of DSRC technology and signal strength to create coverage maps, which involves information theory concepts. Hence, cs.IT is another possible sub-category.\n\n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The use of parked cars as RSUs raises security concerns, such as the risk of unauthorized access to the network. Therefore, cs.CR is a potential sub-category.\n\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The proposed approach involves making decisions based on received signal strength, which can be seen as a control system. Hence, cs.SY is another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
