The paper also discusses the vulnerability of neural networks to attacks with adversarial examples, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.MM) and cybersecurity (cs.CR). The paper proposes a counter-forensic method that can alter images to change their estimated camera model, which involves the use of deep learning techniques (cs.LG) and adversarial attacks (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
