The proposed algorithm Soft-NMS involves modifying the non-maximum suppression step, which is a common technique used in object detection pipelines. This modification is achieved by decaying the detection scores of objects based on their overlap with the highest-scoring object, which involves some level of machine learning (cs.AI) and optimization (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the performance of Soft-NMS on standard datasets, which involves some level of experimental evaluation (cs.CR). Finally, the paper mentions the use of Deformable-RFCN, which is a type of neural network architecture used in object detection (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
