This suggests that the paper belongs to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with monadic types, which are a key feature of Moggi's computational lambda calculus. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category.
