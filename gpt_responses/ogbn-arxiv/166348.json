This involves detecting FNs at multiple scales with a hierarchical organization, which suggests a focus on machine learning and neural networks (cs.LG, cs.NE). The method also involves group sparsity regularization, which is a common technique in machine learning and optimization (cs.AI). The use of fMRI data suggests a focus on computer vision and image processing (cs.CV), while the identification of subject-specific FNs suggests a focus on social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
