The use of temporal logics to express these specifications suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the logic (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on generating trajectories that can be executed synchronously or asynchronously suggests that it may also be relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
