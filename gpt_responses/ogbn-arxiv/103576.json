The paper also evaluates the proposed methods on two unconstrained face image databases, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). The use of support vector regression and similarity scores also suggests information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG) as possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the impact of face image quality on face recognition, which relates to computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
