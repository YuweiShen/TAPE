The focus is on developing a control framework that is scalable and applicable to general classes of stochastic systems and decision-making problem formulations in robotics and autonomy. The paper proposes two architectures for stochastic control that consist of feed-forward and recurrent neural networks. The performance and scalability of the algorithms are investigated in two stochastic optimal control problem formulations, and three systems in simulation. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
