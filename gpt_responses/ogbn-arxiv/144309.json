The paper also discusses the efficiency measures of the proposed protocol, which could fall under the categories of computational complexity (cs.CC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper applies the results to Secure Message Transmission with Public Discussion (SMT-PD), which could be related to networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
