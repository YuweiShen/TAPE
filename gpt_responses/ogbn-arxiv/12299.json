The paper also mentions compressing web graphs, which is a topic related to databases (cs.DB). The discussion of techniques used for compression and the space efficiency of graph representations suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
