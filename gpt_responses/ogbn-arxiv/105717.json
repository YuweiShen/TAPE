Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of RoI-pooling, which is a common technique in object detection, and the combination of different types of features, which are topics that are often discussed in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG and cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a more advanced RPN, which is a type of neural network, and the experimental results are evaluated using a dataset, which are topics that are often discussed in neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
