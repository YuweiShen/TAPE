The proposed approach involves using geometric information to rectify images, which is a common technique in computer graphics (GR). The use of CNN-based detectors also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (LG). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG, and cs.GR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
