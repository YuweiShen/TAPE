This is a common technique in the field of machine learning, which falls under the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nThe paper also mentions the adaptation of the NMT architecture for exploiting context information, which involves the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or attention mechanisms.
