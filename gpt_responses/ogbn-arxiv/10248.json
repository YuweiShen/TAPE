It may also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as it involves mining large amounts of data from the web. Additionally, the use of machine learning techniques for NMT systems makes cs.LG (Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories. Finally, the use of deep learning models for NMT systems may also make cs.DL (Machine Learning) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
