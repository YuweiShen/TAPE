The paper introduces a new technique called NoisyNet, which adds parametric noise to the weights of a neural network to aid exploration. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also evaluates the performance of NoisyNet on Atari games, which suggests that it may be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
