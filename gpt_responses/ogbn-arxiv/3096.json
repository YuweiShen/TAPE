It also introduces the concept of limiting the change in policy to a small Wasserstein distance, which falls under the category of optimization and control. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) and neural networks (cs.NE), which are relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
