It also involves information theory (cs.IT) as well as electronic and communication engineering (cs.ET) since it deals with the implementation of quantum key distribution systems. The paper may also involve programming languages (cs.PL) since the implementation of the protocols may involve coding. Finally, the paper may involve systems and control (cs.SY) since the security of the protocols may depend on the control of the quantum systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
