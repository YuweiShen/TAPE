This makes cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) the most likely categories. The paper also involves the use of exponential random variables, which are a common tool in information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper presents protocols for distributed $\\ell_p$-regression, which falls under the category of distributed systems (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
