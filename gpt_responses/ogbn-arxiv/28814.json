Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses distributed beamforming algorithms, which are commonly used in networked systems, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also presents an implementation strategy, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper uses numerical simulations to evaluate the proposed algorithm, which could be categorized under cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of backhaul power consumption, which could be related to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
