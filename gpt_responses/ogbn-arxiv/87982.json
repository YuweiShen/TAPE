The paper also focuses on object-level SLAM, which involves semantic understanding of the environment, making it relevant to Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of geometric consistency and reformulation of interpretation tree also suggest the involvement of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
