The paper also mentions the usefulness of these parameters in database theory. Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DB (Databases) are likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the study of graph classes and their properties, which falls under cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
