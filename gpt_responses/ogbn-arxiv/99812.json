This involves modeling the problem with a constrained stochastic multi-armed bandit formulation and designing an efficient link selection algorithm. The paper also conducts extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
