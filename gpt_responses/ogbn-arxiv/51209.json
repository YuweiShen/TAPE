The use of control barrier functions and optimization techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of control systems (cs.SY) and mathematical optimization (cs.MA). The paper's focus on decentralized control and lack of requirement for global information suggests that it may also belong to the sub-categories of distributed computing (cs.DC) and systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
