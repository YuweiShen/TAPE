The paper also discusses techniques for automation, which falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL). The use of labelings and diagrams suggests a connection to graph theory and combinatorics, which are subfields of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also mentions experimental results, indicating a focus on empirical studies, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses confluence, which is a topic in formal methods and verification (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
