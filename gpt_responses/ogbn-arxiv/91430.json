Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of regularized covariance matrix estimators, which are commonly used in statistical inference problems, making the Statistics (cs.ST) category a possibility. Finally, the paper uses simulation results to illustrate the proposed method, which suggests that the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) category may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
