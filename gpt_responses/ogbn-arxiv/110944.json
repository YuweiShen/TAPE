The paper introduces a new measure related to simplicity of model classes and discusses how it can help modelers navigate the trade-off between simplicity and accuracy. Given these topics, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.ST (Statistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
