The approach involves analyzing the dynamics involved in the imaging of a fingerprint on a touch-based fingerprint reader, such as perspiration, changes in skin color (blanching), and skin distortion. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-categories. The use of deep learning-based architecture also suggests that the paper may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the use of minutiae-centered local patches extracted from color frames suggests that the paper may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
