The concept of the core, which is the main focus of the paper, is a well-studied notion in cooperative game theory. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes polynomial time algorithms for approximating the core, which involves designing efficient algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses a convex program for maximizing the Nash social welfare, which is a common tool in AI for designing multi-agent systems. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an additive approximation to the core, which is a common technique in machine learning for dealing with intractable optimization problems. \n5. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The problem of allocating public goods involves multiple agents with conflicting interests, which is a central topic in multi-agent systems research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
