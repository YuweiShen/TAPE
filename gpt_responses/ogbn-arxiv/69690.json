This involves the use of machine learning models such as Gaussian process models and multi-layer perceptron neural network surrogate models. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.MS (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper also involves the use of evolutionary algorithms, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The simulations are agent-based, which falls under cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science). Finally, the use of surrogate models involves data management and optimization, which falls under cs.DB (Databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
