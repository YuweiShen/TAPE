The use of universal constraints and the complexity analysis suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The algorithms and computational complexity analysis also suggest relevance to the sub-categories of cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
