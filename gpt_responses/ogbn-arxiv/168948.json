The approach relies on deductive databases (cs.DB) and operations research techniques (cs.CR) to propagate bounds for probabilities and provide precise analytical bounds for probabilistic entailment. The paper also mentions the use of conditional independences, which are relevant in the context of probabilistic graphical models (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
