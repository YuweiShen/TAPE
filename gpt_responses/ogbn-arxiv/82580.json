The algorithms are based on techniques from sparse low-rank linear algebra, verification algorithms, and sparse polynomial interpolation, which are all relevant to the areas of data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), computational geometry (cs.CG), numerical analysis (cs.NA), and scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
