It also involves designing mechanisms that optimize social welfare and revenue, which are objectives commonly studied in algorithmic game theory (cs.AI). The concept of budgets and the discontinuity in utility functions are also relevant to the field of computational economics (cs.EC). The paper also involves approximation algorithms, which are commonly studied in theoretical computer science (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
