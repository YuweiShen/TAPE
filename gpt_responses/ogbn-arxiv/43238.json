Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with information retrieval (IR) and classification, which suggests cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as another likely sub-category. The use of neural classifiers and attention mechanisms indicates that cs.LG (Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the legal domain and the use of a thesaurus suggest that cs.CY (Computers and Society) could be a relevant sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
