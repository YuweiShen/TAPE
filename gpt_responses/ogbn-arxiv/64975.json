The approach involves using a denoiser and randomized smoothing, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning and signal processing. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper involves using APIs from major cloud providers, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
