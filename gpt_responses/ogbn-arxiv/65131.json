The use of graph summarization methodology and interactive visualization suggests that cs.DB (databases) and cs.SI (social and information networks) are the most likely categories. The paper also mentions the challenges of processing large graphs and cluttered images, indicating that cs.DS (data structures and algorithms) and cs.HC (human-computer interaction) are also relevant. Finally, the paper discusses finding patterns and outliers, which is related to cs.IR (information retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
