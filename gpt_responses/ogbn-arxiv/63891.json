The use of a distributed hashtable for holding secret-shared data suggests a focus on distributed systems (cs.DS) and databases (cs.DB). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of incentives for operation, correctness, and fairness, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves designing systems that learn from data and make decisions based on those learnings."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
