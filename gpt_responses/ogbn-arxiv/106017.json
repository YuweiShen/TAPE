It could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as the paper discusses a web crawling method for building subject-aligned comparable corpora from Wikipedia articles. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of machine learning techniques for training and adapting a machine translation system, which could place it in the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper's focus on filtering out noisy or just comparable sentence pairs could also make it relevant to the sub-category of cs.DL (Deep Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
