The paper also discusses the use of domain knowledge to improve robustness, which is a topic often studied in the field of computer security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of deep neural networks for sensing and reasoning, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the use of Bayesian networks, which are often used in the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
