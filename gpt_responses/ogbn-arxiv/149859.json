It may also belong to \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG) as it explores the sensitivity of model performance to changes in architecture components and hyperparameters. Additionally, it could be categorized under \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI) as CNNs are a popular method in the field of AI. \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\" (cs.CV) is another possible sub-category as CNNs are commonly used in image classification tasks, which are related to sentence classification. Finally, \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE) is a potential sub-category as CNNs are a type of neural network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
