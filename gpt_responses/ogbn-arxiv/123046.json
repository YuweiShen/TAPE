It also involves the use of Gr\u00f6bner bases, which is a tool commonly used in cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also mentions the use of cyclic codes, which are often studied in the context of algebraic coding theory (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of product codes, which are relevant to distributed computing and communication (cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of quasi-cyclic codes, which are relevant to control systems and signal processing (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
