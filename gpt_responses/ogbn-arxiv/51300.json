The paper also makes use of concepts from optimization and machine learning, such as primal-dual methods and social welfare functions, which are relevant to the subfields of optimization (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper's focus on the worst-case price of anarchy and its extension to approximate equilibria suggests a connection to the subfield of multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
