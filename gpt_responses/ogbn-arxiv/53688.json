Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of convolutional networks in computer vision (cs.CV), and the convergence of gradient descent to a linear predictor (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the implicit bias of gradient descent (cs.AI) and the use of regularization techniques (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
