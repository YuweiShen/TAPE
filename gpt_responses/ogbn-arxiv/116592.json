The paper also focuses on feature selection for indexing and ranking, which is a key aspect of information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of similarity measurement methods for retrieval suggests the involvement of computer vision (cs.CV) and deep learning (cs.DL) techniques. Finally, the identification of present research issues in the area of content-based video retrieval systems indicates the involvement of machine learning (cs.LG) in this field."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
