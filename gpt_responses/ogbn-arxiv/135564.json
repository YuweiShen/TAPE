Therefore, it is likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves statistical clustering and optimization methods, which are relevant to the social and information sciences (cs.SI) and information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. Finally, the proposed framework uses a GPU-based stochastic projected gradient descent method, which is a type of neural network optimization, making it relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
