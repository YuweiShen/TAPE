This is a common technique in computer vision. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of deep learning techniques falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper specifically mentions the use of feedforward neural networks as a comparison to the proposed approach. \n- cs.HE (High Energy Physics - Experiment): The paper uses a simulation dataset of particle collisions from the CMS experiment at LHC, which falls under the category of high energy physics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
