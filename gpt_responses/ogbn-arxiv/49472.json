The use of psychophysics to study visual perception also suggests a potential overlap with human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also discusses the use of convolutional neural networks, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the evaluation framework presented in the paper involves the use of large datasets and procedural rendering, which could potentially fall under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
