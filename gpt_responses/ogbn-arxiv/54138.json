The paper also presents upper bounds on various properties of KZ reduced matrices, which are related to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The proposed KZ reduction algorithm involves modifying existing search strategies, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
