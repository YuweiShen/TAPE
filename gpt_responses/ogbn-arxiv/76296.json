The paper also focuses on mitigating the straggler problem, which is a common issue in machine learning and optimization algorithms, making the Learning (cs.LG) sub-category a likely fit as well. The proposed scheme also takes into account the heterogeneity of the workers, which falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also involves coding-based approaches, which is a topic in the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed scheme on QingCloud clusters, which falls under the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
