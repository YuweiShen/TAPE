The paper also uses Dempster-Shafer (DS) decision theory for belief fusion of the estimated scores. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves machine learning techniques such as GMM and EM algorithm, which makes cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely categories. The paper also involves information retrieval techniques for feature extraction, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a possible category. Finally, the paper involves human-computer interaction for biometric authentication, which makes cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
