The use of assertions and proof properties suggests a focus on logic and formal methods (cs.LO), while the addition of existential abstraction relates to programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). The paper also involves the analysis of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and the use of artificial intelligence techniques for verification (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
