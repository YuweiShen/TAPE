The paper also discusses the use of these methods for image classification tasks (cs.CV) and natural language processing tasks (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper relies on the connection between wide neural networks and neural tangent kernel (NTK), which is a topic related to neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
