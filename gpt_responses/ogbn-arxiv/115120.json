The approach involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict steering actions from local occupancy maps, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.AI) techniques. The paper also discusses the robustness of the approach to sensor noise, which involves control systems (cs.SY) concepts. Finally, the paper evaluates the approach both qualitatively and quantitatively, which involves statistical learning (cs.LG) methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
