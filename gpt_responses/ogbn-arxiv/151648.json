The paper also involves the computation of these statistics, which is a problem in computational complexity (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper uses numerical methods to approximate these statistics, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also deals with graph theory, specifically the properties of graphs, which is a topic in theoretical computer science (cs.GT).
