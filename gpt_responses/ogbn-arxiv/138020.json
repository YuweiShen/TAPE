The paper focuses on the optimization process and does not make use of the assumed curvature of the objective function, which is a common topic in numerical analysis and optimization research (cs.NE). The proposed algorithm is evaluated on deep networks, which are commonly used in computer vision applications (cs.CV). Finally, the paper provides theoretical convergence proofs and empirical evidence, which are common in theoretical computer science and data science research (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
