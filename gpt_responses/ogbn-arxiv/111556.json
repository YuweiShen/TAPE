The use of binary data in the proposed framework suggests that it may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) applications. The numerical experiments and theoretical analysis suggest that the paper may also be relevant to data science (cs.DS) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
