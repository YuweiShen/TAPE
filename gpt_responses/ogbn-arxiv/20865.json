Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.GT (Game Theory and Mechanism Design). The paper also introduces a non-Bayesian social learning algorithm, which suggests that it may belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses recursive best response algorithms to find the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, which indicates that it may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
