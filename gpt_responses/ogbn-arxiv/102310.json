The paper also discusses the challenges of finding the delicate balance between exploration and exploitation in online recommendations, which is a common problem in Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions serving billions of recommendations per day, which suggests the use of large-scale data processing techniques, such as those used in Scalable Systems (cs.SI) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG, cs.IR, cs.AI, cs.SI, and cs.DS, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
