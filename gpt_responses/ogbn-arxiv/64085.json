The paper also proposes a regularizer to improve the performance of the face feature extraction model, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The paper also introduces a novel supervision signal to align the norms of weight vectors, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper uses a benchmark dataset for face recognition, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the problem of imbalanced training data, which is related to computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
