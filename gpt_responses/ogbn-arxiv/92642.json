The use of graphs and their properties suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of discrete structures (cs.DS) and graph theory (cs.IT). Finally, the mention of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
