The paper proposes a novel approach to extractive document summarization using a fuzzy hypergraph model based on topical representations of sentences. This approach combines techniques from NLP, IR, and machine learning, which are covered by several arXiv CS sub-categories. \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category covers topics related to NLP, including text summarization, topic modeling, and information extraction. This paper's focus on topical representations of sentences and the proposed topic model make cs.CL a likely category.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category covers topics related to search engines, recommendation systems, and text mining. Text summarization is a common application of IR, and the proposed approach aims to improve the relevance and coverage of summaries for a user-defined query, making cs.IR another likely category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers topics related to various machine learning techniques, including clustering, classification, and optimization. The proposed approach uses a fuzzy hypergraph model and an algorithm based on submodular functions to solve the optimization problem, making cs.LG a possible category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers topics related to various AI techniques, including natural language processing, machine learning, and"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
