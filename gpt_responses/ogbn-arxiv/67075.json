The paper also mentions the development of new technical tools and results in algebraic geometry, which suggests that cs.CG (Computational Geometry) may be a relevant sub-category. The paper's focus on rank methods and tensor rank also suggests that cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.IT (Information Theory) may be relevant sub-categories.
