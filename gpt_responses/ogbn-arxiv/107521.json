Specifically, the paper focuses on using self-supervised tasks to provide auxiliary losses for representation learning in reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also mentions using visual inputs, which suggests that it could potentially fall under cs.CV (Computer Vision) or cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
