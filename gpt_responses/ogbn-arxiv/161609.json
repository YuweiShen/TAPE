The paper also discusses architectural techniques for reducing area and improving efficiency, which could fall under computer architecture (cs.AR) or embedded systems (cs.ET). Finally, the paper's focus on achieving the symmetric capacity of binary-input discrete memoryless channels suggests a potential connection to systems and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
