The paper also discusses the challenges posed by incomplete, ambiguous, and redundant labels, which is a topic of interest in the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The Label Refinery proposed in the paper involves updating ground truth labels, which is related to natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses various models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Label Refinery, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
