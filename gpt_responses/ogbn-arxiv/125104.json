The paper focuses on modeling the likelihood of pairwise relationships between two nodes, which is a common problem in many real-world tasks. The paper also proposes to learn a pair embedding under the guidance of its associated context path and devise the pair validity classifier to distinguish whether the pair is valid with respect to the specific task at hand. These techniques are commonly used in sub-categories such as social network analysis (cs.SI), machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), natural language processing (cs.CL), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
