The most likely sub-categories are cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper focuses on optimizing neural network inference and training. Additionally, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.ET (Embedded Systems) are also relevant sub-categories, as the paper discusses the demand for deploying ML models on embedded and mobile systems with tight power and energy constraints."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
