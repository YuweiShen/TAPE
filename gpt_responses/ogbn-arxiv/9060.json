The use of stochastic encoders to satisfy confidentiality requirements suggests a possible connection to coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also employs techniques from the second moment method, which is commonly used in probability theory and statistics, suggesting a possible connection to cs.SI (signal processing and communications) or cs.MM (machine learning). Finally, the paper deals with the transmission of independent messages to non-cooperating receivers, which could fall under the category of networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
