This problem falls under the scope of information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of XOR operations in the proposed coding scheme suggests that the paper may also be relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the focus on privacy and security may also make the paper relevant to the sub-category of security and privacy (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
