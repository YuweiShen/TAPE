The use of a context-free grammar for encoding suggests that information theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant. The paper also discusses the universal property of the proposed code, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). The use of probabilistic models for binary trees suggests that machine learning (cs.LG) may also be relevant.
