The use of coding theory involves the creation of redundant tasks, which is related to information theory (cs.IT). The paper also mentions the use of coded computation in the machine learning pipeline, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG). The problem of stragglers can also be viewed as a control problem, which is related to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the use of coded computation for distributed matrix computations, which is related to numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
