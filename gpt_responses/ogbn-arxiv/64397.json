Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also employs visual inertial navigation and 3D voxel mapping, which falls under the sub-categories cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also presents an autonomous framework for collaborative navigation, which involves path planning and traversability analysis, falling under the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
