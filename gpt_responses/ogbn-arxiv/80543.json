This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence research.\n2. cs.LG: Deep reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning, which is a subset of artificial intelligence. The paper proposes the use of deep reinforcement learning for decision making in AIoT, making it likely to fall under the category of machine learning.\n3. cs.SY: The Autonomous Control System (ACS) mentioned in the abstract falls under the category of control systems, which is a subfield of systems engineering. The integration of IoT and ACS also involves the control of physical systems, making it likely to fall under the category of systems engineering.\n4. cs.NI: The paper discusses the collection and sharing of information by IoT devices, which falls under the category of networked systems. The integration of IoT and ACS also involves the control of physical systems through networked devices, making it likely to fall under the category of networked systems.\n5. cs.SE: The paper proposes a general model for the applications of RL/DRL in AIoT, which involves the design and development of software systems.
