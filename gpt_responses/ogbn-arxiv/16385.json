Additionally, the paper discusses modifications to applications to ensure correctness, which is related to Database Systems (cs.DB) and Software Engineering (cs.SE). The analysis developed in the paper involves detecting and proposing modifications to operations, which is a problem in Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) and Programming Languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
