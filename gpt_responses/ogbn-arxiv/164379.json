This topic falls under the intersection of several computer science sub-disciplines, including information theory (cs.IT), millimeter-wave communication (cs.MM), system and control theory (cs.SY), communication and networking (cs.COMM), and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper, ordered from most to least likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
