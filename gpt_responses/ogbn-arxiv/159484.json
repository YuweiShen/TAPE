The paper proposes a novel approach that involves transfer learning and active learning, which are both subfields of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of autoencoders, which are a type of neural network commonly used in deep learning (cs.AI). The paper deals with hyperspectral images, which are a type of remote sensing data, and remote sensing is a subfield of information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper mentions the use of deep neural networks, which are a type of artificial neural network commonly used in deep learning, and deep learning is a subfield of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
