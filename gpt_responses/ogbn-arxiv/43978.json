This paper could fit under this category as it discusses the computation power of a construct. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering) is less likely but still possible because the paper discusses the expressiveness of a construct, which is relevant to software engineering. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) is also less likely but possible because the paper compares name parameterization with the pi-calculus, which is a model for distributed computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
