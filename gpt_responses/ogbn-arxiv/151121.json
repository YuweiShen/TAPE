This makes cs.CC a likely sub-category.\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper uses structural graph parameters such as treewidth and matching width to obtain the lower bounds on the size of $c$-OBDDs. This suggests that cs.DS is a possible sub-category.\n3. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper deals with the computational complexity of CNFs, which is a topic related to propositional logic. This makes cs.LO a possible sub-category.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses $c$-OBDDs to represent CNFs, which is a technique commonly used in AI for knowledge representation and reasoning. This suggests that cs.AI is a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper uses graph theory and structural parameters such as treewidth and matching width to obtain the lower bounds on the size of $c$-OBDDs.
