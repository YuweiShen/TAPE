The system exploits strong features in the multi-dimensional function produced by reinforcement learning in solving a particular task, which is related to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The system also uses a case base to store and retrieve previously learned solutions, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.RO, cs.SY, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
