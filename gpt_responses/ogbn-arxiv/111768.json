The paper focuses on addressing issues related to training, such as the memory cost dominated by neurons and the dynamic activation of neurons. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper proposes a dimension-reduction search and double-mask selection to obtain batch normalization compatibility, which suggests relevance to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
