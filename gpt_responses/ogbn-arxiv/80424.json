The use of interactive and loud paper prototyping is a human-centered approach, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also discusses the collection and management of requirements, which is a key aspect of software engineering (cs.SE). The study involves mobile application development teams, which could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI) or cybernetics (cs.CY). Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency of different techniques for capturing requirements, which could fall under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
