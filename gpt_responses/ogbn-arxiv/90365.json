Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of various selection techniques and compares them to e-lexicase selection, which is a common topic in the machine learning literature. \n\nThe paper also touches on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it proposes a new selection method that can improve the performance of symbolic regression models. \n\nNeural networks (cs.NE) and control systems (cs.SY) are also possible sub-categories as the paper discusses system identification tasks, which often involve neural networks and control systems. \n\nFinally, software engineering (cs.SE) is a possible sub-category as the paper discusses the computational overhead of the proposed method and how it can be adapted automatically based on the population performance distribution."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
