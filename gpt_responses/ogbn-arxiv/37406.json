The method involves modeling the object state directly in the space of the rigid body motion group SE(2), which is a mathematical concept related to Lie groups (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of Kalman filters, which are a common tool in control systems and robotics (cs.SY), and the analysis of performance involves comparing the proposed method to other models, which is a common approach in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
