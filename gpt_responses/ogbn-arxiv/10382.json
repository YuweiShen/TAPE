The paper also proposes a mechanism for subgraph counting, which is a problem in graph theory and falls under the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category. The paper introduces a new notion called \"empirical sensitivity,\" which is a statistical concept and may be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category.
