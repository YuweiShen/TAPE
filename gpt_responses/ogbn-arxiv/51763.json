The use of (meta-) neural networks to parameterize the updates suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The objective of remembering past snippets of experience suggests a potential application in episodic memories, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the use of embeddings and analysis of performance on different network types suggests a potential application in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
