The use of a compositional loss function also suggests that it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. Additionally, the use of a reparameterized pose representation and the exploitation of joint connection structure suggest that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. The paper may also belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) category as it deals with 3D pose estimation. Finally, the evaluation of the approach's effectiveness suggests that it may belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
