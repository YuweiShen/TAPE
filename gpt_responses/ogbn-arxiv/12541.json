It could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as it deals with multiple modalities. The paper proposes a novel feature learning framework, which involves modifying existing single-modality re-identification models, indicating that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with security and privacy (cs.CR) issues related to video surveillance systems, which could also make it a likely candidate for this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
