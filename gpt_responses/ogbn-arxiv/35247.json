This problem is a generalization of several classical graph problems, including Feedback Vertex Set, Subset Feedback Vertex Set, Multiway Cut, and Odd Cycle Transversal. The problem is studied from a parameterized complexity perspective, where the parameter is the size of the cutset. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
