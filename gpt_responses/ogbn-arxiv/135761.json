This is a problem in computer vision and graphics, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the computational complexity and proposes an efficient solution using Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP), which falls under the category of optimization and control (cs.RO). The paper also provides evaluations on standard sequences and YouTube videos, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper proposes a method to estimate the focal length, which falls under the category of graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the paper proposes a method to simultaneously recover the focal length and the non-rigid shapes, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
