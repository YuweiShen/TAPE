This is a logical contribution and falls under this category.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses a typing relation that can be decided in a practical way. This is a programming language-related contribution and falls under this category.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper does not seem to have any direct relation to information theory, but it does introduce a new type theory that could have implications for information theory.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not seem to have any direct relation to machine learning.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper does not seem to have any direct relation to computation and language."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
