The use of algorithms to compute stable partitions suggests that the paper may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS). The analysis of the core and strict core concepts in hedonic games may be of interest to researchers in social choice theory (cs.SI). Finally, the use of polynomial-time algorithms and complexity results suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of theoretical computer science (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
