This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) as it involves the capacity of finite blocklength codes. The paper also considers non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA) schemes, which are topics in networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The problem of handling heterogeneous receiver conditions and interference mitigation falls under the category of control and systems engineering (cs.SY). The paper also proposes a hybrid transmission scheme that involves bit and time allocation, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) as these fields deal with data allocation and optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
