This task is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG), as it involves designing a functionally interpretable structure for the generic network and using a new distillation algorithm to overcome specific challenges of network transplanting. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of natural language processing (cs.CL) in the context of interpreting the structure of the generic network. The paper also mentions the use of neural networks (cs.NE) in the context of pre-trained networks and distillation algorithms. Finally, the paper mentions the use of sample annotations, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
