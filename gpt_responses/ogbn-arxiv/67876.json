The use of channel correlations and the absence of channel state information at the transmitters suggest that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the exploration of outer and inner bounds and the analysis of the feasibility of interference alignment under channel uncertainty may involve some aspects of data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
