The paper also proposes a low-complexity algorithm to obtain an optimal transmit-signal vector, which involves optimization and signal processing techniques (cs.NI). The use of iterative-hard-thresholding algorithm and bit-flipping algorithm also suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the simulation results presented in the paper involve the evaluation of performance metrics such as symbol-error-rate (SER), which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
