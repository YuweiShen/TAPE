The use of concentration bounds and empirical distributions suggests a focus on learning and generalization, which is a key aspect of machine learning. The mention of multi-armed bandit problems and optimization also suggests a focus on algorithms and optimization, which are common topics in computer science. Therefore, likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.ST (Statistics), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
