Additionally, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a common technique in computer vision research. The paper also involves the use of linear regression and optimization, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.NE, cs.LG). The paper's focus on the visual perception process of the human brain suggests that it could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper's potential applications in neuroscience and cognitive science suggest that it could also belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
