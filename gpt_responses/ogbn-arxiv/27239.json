The proposed method involves hierarchical fusion of feature maps, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The experimental results are conducted on the CIFAR dataset, which is a common benchmark for computer vision tasks (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
