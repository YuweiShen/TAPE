It may also belong to the machine learning (cs.MM) and learning (cs.LG) sub-categories as it involves the use of optimization and regularization techniques. The numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category is also a possibility as it involves solving a linear system. Finally, the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category may be relevant as the paper deals with electron microscopy image datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
