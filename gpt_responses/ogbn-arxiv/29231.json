This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed transmission scheme involves spatial coupling of signals, which is a common technique used in communication networks. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not explicitly discuss social networks, but the proposed transmission scheme can be applied to networks with multiple users or nodes.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): Similar to cs.COMM, the proposed transmission scheme involves techniques used in communication networks.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper does not focus on data structures or algorithms, but the proposed transmission scheme involves iterative decoding algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
