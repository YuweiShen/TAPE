Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also mentions the use of anisotropic and non-metric regularizers, which suggests that it may belong to cs.GR (Graphics) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of functional lifting and convex relaxation techniques indicates that it may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
