The techniques used in the algorithms are tabulation and sparse dynamic programming, which are commonly used in data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the edit distance problem, which is related to computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.DM). The analysis of the algorithms involves probabilistic arguments, which are often used in theoretical computer science (cs.CC) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
