This involves the use of high-definition maps and bird's-eye view images as input to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, since the paper deals with the safety and security of self-driving vehicles, it may also fall under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
