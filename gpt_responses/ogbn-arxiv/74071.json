The use of MMSE estimation and effective capacity formulation suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the analysis of power allocation and tradeoffs suggests a possible connection to game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
