The paper also proposes a method for automatically finding better neural architectures, which involves optimizing connection weights and spatio-temporal interactions, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper uses multiple input types and temporal resolutions, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also involves searching for optimal architectures, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper uses evolutionary algorithms to optimize the neural architectures, which is a topic related to neural evolution (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
