This suggests that the paper could belong to the computational complexity sub-category.\n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The multivariate resultant is a tool used in symbolic computation, which involves manipulating mathematical expressions symbolically rather than numerically. The paper's focus on the multivariate resultant suggests that it could belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents hardness results for a decision problem related to polynomial systems, which could be seen as an algorithmic problem. This suggests that the paper could belong to the data structures and algorithms sub-category.\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The multivariate resultant is a tool used in computational algebraic geometry, which is a subfield of computational geometry. The paper's focus on the multivariate resultant suggests that it could belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper's focus on polynomial systems could be seen as related to systems and control theory, which involves the analysis and design of systems that can be modeled mathematically.
