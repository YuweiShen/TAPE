The focus on quantifying the improvements in classification results due to combining suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of classifiers for pattern recognition also suggests that the paper could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The mention of linear and non-linear combiners suggests that the paper could also be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
