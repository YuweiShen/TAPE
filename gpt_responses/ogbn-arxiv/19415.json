Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves learning and optimization, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of web-based technology and online platforms could place it in cs.CY (Computers and Society) or cs.CE (Computers and Education). Finally, the paper discusses a specific application of the proposed method to a Digital Signal Processing course, which could place it in cs.ET (Emerging Technologies)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
