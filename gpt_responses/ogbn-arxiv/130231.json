This approach involves recording and displaying data during normal program executions, which is relevant to software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL). The display of data in an ambient way also involves human-computer interaction (cs.HCI) and software design (cs.SD). Finally, the paper suggests future research directions, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) for improving the efficiency of recording and displaying data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
