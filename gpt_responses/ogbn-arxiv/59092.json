The paper discusses the use of a learned state-transition model to dynamically construct plans by selecting and traversing between simulated states and actions to maximize information before acting. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers topics related to intelligent agents, machine learning, and decision-making. The paper's focus on deep reinforcement learning and online planning makes it a likely fit for this sub-category. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers topics related to the design and analysis of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. The paper's use of a learned state-transition model suggests that it may be relevant to this sub-category as well. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): This sub-category covers topics related to the design and control of robots. The paper's focus on planning and decision-making in the context of reinforcement learning could be relevant to robotics applications. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category covers topics related to the analysis and control of complex systems. The paper's use of a learned state-transition model to dynamically construct plans suggests that it may be relevant to this sub-category as well. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
