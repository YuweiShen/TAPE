The paper also discusses pseudorandomness, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper's focus on locality-sensitive hashing and hash functions suggests that it may also be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper's mention of self-tuning algorithms suggests that it may be relevant to neural networks and machine learning (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
