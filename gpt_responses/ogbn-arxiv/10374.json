The paper also discusses confluence and termination, which are topics related to logic and formal methods. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper deals with a system of types and effects for multi-threaded programs, which is a topic related to programming languages. The paper also introduces a discipline of region usage, which is a programming language concept. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses confluence and termination, which are important properties of software systems. The paper also presents a system for multi-threaded programs, which is a topic related to software engineering. \n- cs.TL (Type Theory): The paper presents an affine-intuitionistic system of types and effects, which is a topic related to type theory. The paper also discusses region usage, which is a concept related to type systems. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper presents a logical system and discusses confluence and termination, which are topics related to formal languages and automata theory.
