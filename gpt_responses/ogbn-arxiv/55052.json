This involves fusing information from standard kinetic models of diffusion and perfusion MRI with automated data selection of raw 4D PWI image information, followed by a data-driven deep-learning modeling of the underlying blood flow hemodynamics. This work involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) techniques, as well as medical imaging (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
