The use of coresets and sketches is a technique commonly used in computational geometry (cs.CG) and machine learning (cs.LG), which are also mentioned in the abstract. Finally, the use of homomorphic encryption suggests a possible connection to complexity theory (cs.CC) and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
