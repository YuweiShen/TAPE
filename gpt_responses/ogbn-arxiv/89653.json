This involves techniques such as part-based shape modeling, normalization of pose, statistical shape modeling, and alignment. These techniques are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV), computer graphics (cs.GR), machine learning (cs.LG), robotics (cs.RO), and multimedia (cs.MM). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
