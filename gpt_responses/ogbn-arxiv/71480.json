The method proposed in the paper involves shaping the embedding space of the model, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.AI) and deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of auxiliary annotations and constraints, which are relevant topics in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
