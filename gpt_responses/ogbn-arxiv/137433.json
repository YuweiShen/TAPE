Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also leverages external information to achieve the task, which falls under the scope of information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the proposed method involves memory cells to store aspect-related knowledge, which can be considered as a form of memory-augmented neural networks, falling under the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
