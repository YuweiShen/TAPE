This is a common problem in distributed and parallel computing. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes a solution for dense linear algebra, which is a subfield of numerical analysis. \n- cs.AR (Architecture): The paper deals with Arm big little architectures and proposes a solution to exploit asymmetry in these architectures. \n- cs.PF (Performance): The paper focuses on delivering higher performance for dense linear algebra on Arm big little architectures, which falls under the category of performance optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
