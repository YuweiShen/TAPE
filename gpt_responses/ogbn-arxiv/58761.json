This falls under computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of shifting coresets, which is a technique commonly used in data stream algorithms (cs.DM) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper presents results for well-known optimization problems, which may be of interest to researchers in theoretical computer science (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
