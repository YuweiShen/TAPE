This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) as it deals with the fundamental limits of communication. The paper also proposes novel broadcasting schemes, which involves optimization and algorithm design, falling under the categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses practical insights, which could fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) or computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
