It also involves the use of backpropagation, which is a common technique in machine learning. Additionally, the paper uses datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, which are commonly used in machine learning research. \n\nThe paper also involves computer vision (cs.CV) as it uses image datasets and discusses the performance of neural networks on image classification tasks. \n\nThe sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also likely as the paper deals with neural networks and their performance. \n\nThe paper could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves the use of deep neural networks, which are a popular technique in AI research. \n\nFinally, the sub-category of cs.CL (Computation and Language) is a possibility as the paper discusses the performance of neural networks on language-related tasks such as text classification.
