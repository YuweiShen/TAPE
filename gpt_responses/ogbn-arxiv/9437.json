Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the use of cloud technology, SDN/NFV, and smart devices, which are related to distributed computing and data management, suggesting that cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are also likely categories. The paper also discusses the applications and use cases of mobile edge networks, which may fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
