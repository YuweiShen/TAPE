The use of relays is also common in networking (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of binary-symmetric channels and additive white Gaussian noise channels, which are common in communication systems (cs.COMM). Finally, the paper proposes an explicit coding scheme, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) if the scheme involves the transmission of audio or video data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
