This attack is aimed at maximizing the wiretapping signal-to-noise ratio in the subsequent downlink data transmission phase. The paper proposes optimization problems to maximize the wiretapping SNR and investigates two different scenarios: one where the base station is unaware of the attack and another where it attempts to detect it. The paper also proposes an efficient algorithm to solve the optimization problems. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
