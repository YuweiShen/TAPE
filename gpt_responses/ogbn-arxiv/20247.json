The paper also discusses path loss models, antenna height differences, and interference power, which are all related to information theory (cs.IT) and system dynamics (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions multi-antenna and multi-BS joint transmissions, which are topics in multimedia systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of correlated shadow fading, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
