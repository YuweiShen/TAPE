This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The proposed network can be used for real-time 3D human pose estimation, which can be useful in robotics applications such as human-robot interaction, motion planning, and control.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses deep learning techniques to estimate human pose in 3D space. The network architecture and training process are discussed in detail, which falls under the domain of machine learning.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper uses multi-view images as input data for estimating human pose in 3D space. This falls under the domain of multimedia.\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed network uses both vision and IMU data to estimate human pose in 3D space, which can be considered as an application of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
