The paper discusses the use of ambient FM radio signals as a signal source for backscatter communication, which involves a multiplication operation on RF signals. The paper proposes a modulation technique that transforms backscatter into an addition operation on the audio signals output by FM receivers, enabling the embedding of digital data as well as arbitrary audio into ambient analog FM radio signals. The paper also discusses the implementation of prototype hardware and the achievement of data rates and ranges while consuming minimal power. The paper also demonstrates the potential of the design by fabricating a prototype on a cotton t-shirt and embedding FM antennas into posters and billboards. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.EM (Electromagnetics), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
