Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential use of the proposed method in UAVs, quadcopters, and drones, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel online method that uses shape matching, which could be of interest to researchers in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the computational efficiency of the proposed method, which could be of interest to researchers in the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
