This involves jointly optimizing the estimation of class priors or label noises and the classifier learning. The proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets and an e-commerce dataset, which suggests that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various settings. Given the focus on machine learning and optimization techniques, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other possible sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
