The paper also discusses probability measures and composition theorems, which are related to information theory (cs.IT). The use of liftings and quantification over sets of samples suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) or data science (cs.DS) perspective. Finally, the paper proposes a new construction for approximate lifting, which could be considered a contribution to the field of statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
