It is also likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as it involves training a dynamic network that can modify its objective at inference time. Additionally, it may belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category as it deals with optimizing the performance of neural networks. Finally, it may belong to the software engineering (cs.SD) sub-category as it involves developing a fast and interactive solution for modifying the network in real-time."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
