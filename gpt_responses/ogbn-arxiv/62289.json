The paper also discusses the use of hashing and quantization techniques, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper presents a novel approach for achieving high recall rates with low storage and computational requirements, which could be of interest to researchers in the systems and control (cs.SD) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
