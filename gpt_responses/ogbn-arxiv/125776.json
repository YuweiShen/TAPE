The focus is on bandlimited spaces, which are also relevant in signal processing and communication theory. The paper also presents an algorithm for constructing universal sampling sets, which involves computational aspects (cs.NA). The study of discrete signals and their properties is a fundamental topic in computer science, which falls under the category of discrete structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions applications to additive uncertainty principles, which is a topic in signal processing and information theory related to compressed sensing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
