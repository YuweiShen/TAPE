The focus is on problems parameterized above or below tight bounds, which suggests that the paper may belong to the computational complexity (cs.CC) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. The use of linear equations and Boolean formulas in the examples suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The mention of \"order constraint satisfaction problems\" suggests that the paper may also belong to the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-category. Finally, the discussion of results obtained in the last few years suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
