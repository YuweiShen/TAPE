It also involves privacy-preserving techniques, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The use of unlabeled examples and the focus on sample complexity suggests a connection to semi-supervised learning and active learning, which are subfields of data mining and artificial intelligence (cs.DS, cs.AI). Finally, the paper may involve information theory (cs.IT) in the analysis of the sample complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
