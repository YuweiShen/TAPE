The proposed method is evaluated on various benchmark datasets related to computer vision (cs.CV) and image classification (cs.AI). The paper also introduces a hybrid architecture of dueling deep Q-learning algorithm and a surrogate deep model, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) and deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
