Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves signal processing and approximation theory, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of trigonometric functions suggests a connection to Fourier analysis, which could place the paper in cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
