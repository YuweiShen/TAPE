This topic falls under the category of computational social choice (cs.GT), which studies the computational aspects of social choice theory. The paper also involves analyzing the complexity of various operations and parameters, which suggests a focus on algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper explores the complexity of the problems under different voting rules, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
