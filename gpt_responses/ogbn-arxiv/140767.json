The paper proposes a new notion of optimality for safe planning in unknown environments and derives a pseudo-optimal class of policies. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under Robotics (cs.RO), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
