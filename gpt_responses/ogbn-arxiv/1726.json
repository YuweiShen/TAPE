This topic is closely related to databases (cs.DB) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), as OMQs are used in knowledge representation and reasoning. The paper specifically focuses on the description logic \\(\\mathcal{EL}\\) (cs.LO) and conjunctive queries (cs.CR), and presents an algorithm for computing first-order rewritings of OMQs based on atomic queries. Finally, the paper includes experiments with real-world ontologies, which suggests a practical application of the proposed approach (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
