Therefore, cs.IR and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes novel approaches using supervised learning, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the experiments involve cross-classifier and cross-corpus evaluations, which suggest a focus on data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
