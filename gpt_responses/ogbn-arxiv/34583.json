The use of LP-rounding algorithms and primal-dual algorithms suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) sub-categories. The focus on approximation algorithms and optimization implies that the paper may also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories.
