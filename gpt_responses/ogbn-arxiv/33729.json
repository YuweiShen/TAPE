The use of function approximators and policy improvement methods also suggests a focus on machine learning techniques. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with navigation in a three-dimensional environment, which suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO). The use of successor features also suggests a focus on control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques is also likely given the focus on RL and generalisation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
