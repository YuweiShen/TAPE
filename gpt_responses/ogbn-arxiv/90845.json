This could place the paper under the cryptography and security sub-category.\n4. cs.COM (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses the impact of poor network performance on small Pacific Island states and their ability to access the benefits of the internet, which could fall under the computers and society sub-category.\n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - While the paper does not explicitly discuss distributed, parallel, or cluster computing, the use of network coding to improve network performance could be seen as a form of distributed computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
