The most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper deals with training and evaluating Deep RL algorithms. The second likely category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as Deep RL is a sub-field of AI. The third likely category is cs.RO (Robotics), as the paper mentions the importance of generalisation in robotics. The fourth likely category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), as the paper deals with control tasks. The fifth likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision), as the paper mentions the use of simulators in training Deep RL policies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
