This involves information theory concepts such as mapping spatially-modulated bits onto indices of antenna arrays. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with multi-user massive MIMO millimeter wave networks, which involves networking and internet architecture aspects such as channel access, resource allocation, and interference management. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of hybrid beamforming and spatial modulation to improve the performance of millimeter wave networks, which are often used for high-bandwidth multimedia applications. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a system model that involves both transmitter and receiver components, which can be analyzed and optimized using systems and control theory. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): The paper does not directly address social or ethical issues related to computing, but it may have implications for the design and deployment of future communication systems that could impact society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
