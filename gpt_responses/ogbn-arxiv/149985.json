Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.AI, which deals with artificial intelligence. The paper also mentions the use of dataflow program graphs like Google's TensorFlow, which falls under the sub-category cs.LG (machine learning). The reference game called Face Battle involves computer vision, which falls under the sub-category cs.CV. The paper also mentions the creation of AI in a new way, which could fall under the sub-category cs.SI (social and information networks). Finally, the paper could also fall under the sub-category cs.GR (graphics) as it involves the development of new esport games."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
