Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques to detect term dependence, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper involves crowdsourcing experiments to collect user assessments, which could fall under cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The paper also involves statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, which could fall under cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
