The paper describes a method to adapt machine vision methods to the peculiarities of RTI to enable real-time multiple target tracking. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also uses radio tomographic imaging (RTI) to generate images of the change in the propagation field, which is related to computer vision. Hence, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the second most likely category. The paper also deals with tracking, which is related to control systems, and hence cs.SY (Systems and Control) is the third most likely category. The paper also uses weighted averaging, which is related to information theory, and hence cs.IT (Information Theory) is the fourth most likely category. Finally, the paper deals with real-time tracking, which is related to multimedia, and hence cs.MM (Multimedia) is the fifth most likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
