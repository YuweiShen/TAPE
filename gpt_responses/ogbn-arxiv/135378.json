Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also uses machine learning techniques, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of lexical resources, which could fall under cs.LG (Learning). The paper also deals with text simplification, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper involves the automatic discovery of AltLexes, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
