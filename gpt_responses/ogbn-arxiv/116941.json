The paper proposes a novel method to improve the accuracy of pre-trained word embeddings for sentiment analysis. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and text classification. The paper also uses deep learning models, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper involves lexicon-based approaches, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper uses Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging techniques, which could be related to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
