The use of a deep fully-connected neural network also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The proposed Robust Non-Linear Knowledge Transfer Model (R-NKTM) involves transferring knowledge from one view to another, which could fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of synthetic 3D human models and motion capture data suggests that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of the R-NKTM for scaling to incorporate new action classes suggests that it could belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
