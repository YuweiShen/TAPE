The use of algebraic structures and linear span also suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to security and privacy (cs.SI) since PIR codes are used to protect sensitive data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
