It also discusses the learning and inference capabilities of these networks, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of functional design and decomposition in tracker design, which is related to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper proposes a novel formalism for comparing trackers, which could potentially fall under neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
