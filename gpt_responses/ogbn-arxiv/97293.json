The use of visual data also suggests a potential fit with computer vision (cs.CV). The paper proposes a novel factor-graph formulation to enforce structural regularities in the mesh, which involves optimization techniques that are often used in machine learning (cs.LG) and graph theory (cs.GR). Finally, the paper proposes an incremental approach to building the mesh, which could involve techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) such as planning and decision-making."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
