This involves computing similarities between items and integrating them with the Item-KNN algorithm. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories, as these areas are closely related to recommender systems. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of natural language processing techniques to extract information from literary themes, which suggests a connection to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method in terms of user experience, which indicates a potential link to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
