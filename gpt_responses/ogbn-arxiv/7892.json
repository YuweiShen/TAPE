The paper also discusses the use of maxout and Network in Network (NIN) layers, which are commonly used in deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed models on two popular face recognition datasets, LFW and YTF, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper discusses the reduction of computational cost, which is a topic of interest in neural networks (cs.NE) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
