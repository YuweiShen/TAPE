The concepts of directed path-width and directed tree-width are also relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper discusses the application of these concepts to directed co-graphs, which are related to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
