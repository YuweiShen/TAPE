This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of natural language processing (NLP) to generate answers also brings in the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the use of regression to localize textual answers, which falls under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the generation of a dataset for testing the methods involves information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
