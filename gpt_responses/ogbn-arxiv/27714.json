The paper proposes a new technique to split the network structure into small parts that consume lower memory than the original network. This technique is relevant to the computer vision community (cs.CV) as it focuses on CNNs. Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of memory management, which is a common concern in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed technique involves reducing the number of computational operations, which is also relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) community. Finally, the paper deals with the problem of memory consumption, which is a topic of interest in the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
