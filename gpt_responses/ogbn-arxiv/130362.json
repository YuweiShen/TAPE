The paper discusses the challenges of dealing with noisy data and aims to optimize the method of large margin classifier based on hyperdisk. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), data mining (cs.DM), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
