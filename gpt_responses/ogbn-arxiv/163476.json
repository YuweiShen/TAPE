This suggests that the paper could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper specifically mentions convolutional layers, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks, indicating that the paper could also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also introduces a novel training scheme, which could fall under the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper addresses the challenge of supporting deep learning services with dynamic workload cost-effectively, which could be relevant to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
