The focus on active ranking and the use of confidence intervals suggests that the paper may fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The analysis of the algorithm's performance and the lower bound for parametric models suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), statistics (cs.ST), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
