Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a deep learning model with plug-in modules to address the challenges of data imbalance and lack of hard negative examples, which falls under the scope of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions the difficulty in accurate groundtruthing, which could be related to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the use of a fully convolutional network and online hard example mining suggests a potential connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
