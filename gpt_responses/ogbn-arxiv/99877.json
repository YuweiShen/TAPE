Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are the most likely categories. The paper also involves the use of distributed RL, which falls under cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Lastly, the paper discusses the challenges of deploying an RL solution in the real world, which could fall under cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
