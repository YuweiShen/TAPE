Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of activation functions and their impact on the performance of the network, which is related to machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). Hence, cs.IR and cs.LG are also likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of multi-stream aggregation, which is related to multimedia (MM) processing. Finally, the paper proposes an end-to-end learning approach, which is related to artificial intelligence (AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
