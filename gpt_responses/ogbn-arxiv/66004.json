Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The use of deep learning models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and Temporal Deep Restricted Boltzmann Machines (TDRBMs) also suggests that the paper could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of face databases and the evaluation of the proposed approach on these databases suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
