The paper also discusses various evaluation approaches and benchmarks, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper proposes a new formal definition of intelligence based on Algorithmic Information Theory, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
