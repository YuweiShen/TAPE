This falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper proposes a multiobjective approach using optimization techniques, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The topic of energy distribution and management is also relevant to the categories of energy and power systems (cs.ET) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
