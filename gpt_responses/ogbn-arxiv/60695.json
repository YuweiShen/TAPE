This topic is relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including database systems (cs.DB), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), information retrieval (cs.IR), human-computer interaction (cs.HC), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper proposes benefit and cost models to optimize human involvement and develops a question scheduling framework to improve the accuracy of the final golden records. These techniques are applicable to a wide range of data integration tasks and can be used in various domains, such as e-commerce, healthcare, and finance. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DB, cs.AI, cs.IR, cs.HC, and cs.LG, in descending order of relevance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
