The paper proposes a new stage-based execution strategy for hyper-parameter optimization algorithms, which is a novel approach to solving the problem of redundant computations. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
