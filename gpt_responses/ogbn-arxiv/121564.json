The proposed method is an ensemble of matrix factorization and neural networks, which falls under the category of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The method also involves analyzing large datasets of historical yield performances, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV) or information retrieval (cs.IR) categories. Additionally, the paper mentions collaborative filtering, which is a common technique in recommender systems and falls under social and information networks (cs.SI) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
