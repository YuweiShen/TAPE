The paper also mentions iterative approximation of maximum entropies, which is a common technique in machine learning and statistical inference (cs.LG). The concept of self-organization and anticipation may fall under the category of complex systems (cs.SI), and the empirical testing of the model may involve computational methods (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
