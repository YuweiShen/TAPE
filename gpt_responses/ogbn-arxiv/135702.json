The paper also leverages a theoretical framework rooted in engagement and behavioural science research, which suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of building engagement models that can generalize across multiple game titles and genres, which could be relevant to the fields of graphics (cs.GR) and cybersecurity (cs.CYBER)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
