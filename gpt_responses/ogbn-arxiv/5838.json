This involves extracting supportive information over the entire span of a video, which is then used to provide context and enable the model to relate the present to the past. This is a problem that falls under computer vision (CV), specifically video understanding. Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning (ML) techniques, as it proposes a method to augment existing models. Therefore, cs.LG (machine learning) is also a likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper involves the use of supportive information to enable models to relate the present to the past, which involves reasoning and understanding. Therefore, cs.AI (artificial intelligence) is another likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper involves experiments on three challenging video datasets, which involves multimedia (MM) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Therefore, cs.MM is another likely sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper involves the use of language to describe the proposed method and the experiments, which involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Therefore, cs.CL (computational linguistics) is another likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
