The paper focuses on the signal processing and hardware cost reduction aspects of the proposed system. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the channel model and throughput gains, which suggests that it could belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The proposed system involves a large antenna array, which could also place it in the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the integration of an electromagnetic lens with the antenna array is a unique aspect of the proposed system, which could make it relevant to the sub-category cs.EM (Electromagnetics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
