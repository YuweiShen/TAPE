The experiments were conducted on a real robot, further supporting this category.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): Object recognition is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and the paper proposes a method for recognizing objects through touch. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses Monte Carlo tree search, a popular AI technique, to approximate the optimal sequence of wrist poses for accurate recognition. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper's approach involves adaptively selecting wrist poses to maximize recognition confidence, which can be seen as a machine learning problem. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper's focus on active object recognition using touch can also be seen as a problem in systems and control, as it involves controlling the robot's end effector to achieve accurate recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
