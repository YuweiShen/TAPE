The problem of online learning is typically studied in the machine learning and artificial intelligence communities, which fall under the cs.LG and cs.AI sub-categories. The paper also introduces a new notion of regret, which is a common measure of performance in online learning, and this could be of interest to researchers in the cs.DS (data structures and algorithms) and cs.IT (information theory) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a novel algorithm for DTOL that achieves good performance, which could be of interest to researchers in the cs.SY (systems and control) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
