The focus on context-free and deterministic context-free languages suggests that formal language theory (cs.FL) is also relevant. The use of memory and space in computation suggests that data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant. Finally, the use of finite-state control suggests that logic in computer science (cs.LO) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
