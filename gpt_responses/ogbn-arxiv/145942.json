The use of plan-time sufficient statistics and the characterization of the value function suggest that the paper may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The study of structural properties of the value function is related to optimization (cs.SY) and mathematical analysis (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
