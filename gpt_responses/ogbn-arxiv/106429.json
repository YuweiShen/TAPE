The use of deep neural networks for this task also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The proposed boosted sampling scheme and algorithm for boosting the SGD learning rate schedule suggest that it could also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the mention of state-of-the-art results on a benchmark suggests that it could belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
