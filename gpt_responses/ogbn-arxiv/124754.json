Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves quantization and subcodes, which are common in multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). The concept of interference is also mentioned, which falls under networked systems (cs.NI) and computer communication (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
