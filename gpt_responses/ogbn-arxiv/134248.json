The algorithm is trained and applied to a specific dataset of beef cattle, which suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of a simple framework for outputting predictions, which could fall under natural language processing (cs.NE) or information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
