The use of a wideband sliding correlator channel sounder and horn antennas suggests a focus on signal processing and communication technology (cs.MM), while the characterization of the effect of penetration loss for materials with similar composition indicates a possible application in augmented reality (cs.AR) or materials science (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
