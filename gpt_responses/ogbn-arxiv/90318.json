The proposed algorithm, LCIP, is a learning algorithm that learns from past impacts to predict future impacts, which suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also mentions code mutations, which falls under the programming languages (cs.PL) sub-category. Additionally, the use of strongly tested Java software applications suggests a software development (cs.SD) sub-category.
