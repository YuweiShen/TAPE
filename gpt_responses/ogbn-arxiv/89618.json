Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper involves mathematical analysis and algorithm design, which are also relevant to sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the practical implementation of selection schemes, which could fall under sub-categories such as cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
