Information theory concepts such as diversity and decoding complexity are discussed in the paper. \n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper proposes a new communication system and analyzes its performance in a frequency selective channel. The paper also discusses the decoding complexity of the proposed system. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new communication system and analyzes its performance in a frequency selective channel. The paper also discusses the decoding complexity of the proposed system. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a new communication system and analyzes its performance in a frequency selective channel. The paper also discusses the decoding complexity of the proposed system. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper proposes a new communication system and analyzes its performance in a frequency selective channel. The paper also discusses the decoding complexity of the proposed system. The proposed system can be used for multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
