The proposed techniques involve changes in the network architecture and training process, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of activation functions and network stacking, which are common techniques in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed techniques on large-scale image recognition, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
