The Chernoff-Hoeffding inequality is a fundamental tool in probability theory and information theory (cs.IT), which are also relevant to the paper's content. The paper's focus on accuracy trade-offs and estimation also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and statistics (cs.ST)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
