Specifically, the paper focuses on deep exploration in sparse reward environments, which is a common problem in reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also proposes new tabular environments for benchmarking exploration, which suggests a possible fit with cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
