It also mentions the use of object stealing to adapt to changing access locality, which is a common problem in distributed computing. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category as it proposes a novel approach to achieving fast phase-2 commits using flexible quorums. \n\nThe Operating Systems (cs.OS) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper discusses the implementation of WPaxos and its evaluation on WAN deployments across 5 AWS regions. \n\nThe Networked and Internet Systems (cs.NI) sub-category is another possibility as the paper focuses on achieving low-latency and high-throughput consensus across wide-area network (WAN) deployments. \n\nFinally, the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category is a possibility as the paper proposes a protocol for achieving consensus in distributed systems, which is a common problem in control systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
