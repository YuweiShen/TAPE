The paper also proposes a new method to address occlusions, which is a well-known challenge in computer vision. \n\nThe paper also involves optimization and modeling, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. \n\nThe paper's focus on joint optical flow and occlusion estimation suggests that it may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category, as this is an important problem in robotics applications. \n\nFinally, the paper's use of benchmarks and performance evaluation suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category, as this is a common practice in multimedia research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
