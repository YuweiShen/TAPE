Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the minimax estimator, which is a Bayesian estimator, and relates minimax regret to channel capacity, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also presents examples for the construction of a minimax filter, which could place it in cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
