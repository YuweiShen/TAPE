This topic is closely related to distributed computing (cs.DC), cryptography (cs.CR), information theory (cs.IT), and computational complexity (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper presents new techniques for proving lower bounds, which could be of interest to researchers in data structures (cs.DS) who work on lower bounds for algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
