The paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian model for gaining diagnostic insights into in-house well-trained judges. The paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) as it deals with probabilistic models and Bayesian inference. It could also belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a model that outperforms an existing model. Additionally, the paper deals with analyzing ratings, which could fall under the sub-categories of Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Information Retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper could also belong to the sub-category of Statistics (cs.ST) as it deals with probabilistic models and Bayesian inference."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
