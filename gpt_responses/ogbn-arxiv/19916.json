The use of Hadamard transforms suggests that information theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant. The chaining technique may involve the use of algorithms and data structures (cs.CC) to efficiently process the input and output sequences. The paper may also be relevant to security and privacy (cs.SI) and software engineering (cs.SE) as it discusses a new method for encryption and hashing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
