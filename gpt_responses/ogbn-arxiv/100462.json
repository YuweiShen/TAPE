The proposed method involves modifying the bounding box representation and introducing additional target variables for regression. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves machine learning techniques for regression, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also involves robotics (cs.RO) to some extent, as it discusses pedestrian detection in fisheye images. Finally, the paper involves information retrieval (cs.IR) to some extent, as it discusses scene text detection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
