The paper discusses several basic results about how elicitation complexity behaves, and the complexity of standard properties of interest. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG), Information Theory (cs.IT), Statistics (cs.ST), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
