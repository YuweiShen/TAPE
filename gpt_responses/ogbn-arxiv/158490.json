Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Additionally, the paper mentions using performance prediction methods as heuristics, which suggests a connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of graph search also suggests a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper involves working with text data and language models, which suggests a connection to computational linguistics (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
