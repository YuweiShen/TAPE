This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with partial observability, which is a common problem in game theory (cs.GT) and robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of full game state information, which could involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
