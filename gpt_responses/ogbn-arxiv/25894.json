This optimization problem can be viewed as a control problem, which falls under the domain of systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper mentions that the multi-antenna hybrid access point (HAP) receives sensing data from the low-power wireless devices (WDs), which could potentially involve multimedia data. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a non-convex joint optimization problem that can be transformed into a convex one and solved using off-the-shelf convex algorithms, which involves computational engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
