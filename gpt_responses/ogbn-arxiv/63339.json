The paper also proposes a benchmark problem for multi-agent learning, which falls under game theory (cs.GT) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Additionally, the benchmark problem involves micromanagement challenges in a real-time strategy game, which could involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
