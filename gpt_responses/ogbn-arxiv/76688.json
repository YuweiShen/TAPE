The method is applicable to both image and video hashing. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also deals with similarity metrics and optimization, which are relevant to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper's focus on retrieval performance makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another likely category. Finally, the use of Hadamard matrix for constructing hash centers suggests a connection to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and its subfield of matrix theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
