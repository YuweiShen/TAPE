The paper also discusses visual recognition algorithms and deep models, which are related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The online adaptation algorithm presented in the paper is based on batch-normalization layers, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of benchmarks to assess the generalization and robustness capabilities of visual recognition algorithms, which is related to the field of robotics and autonomous systems (cs.ROBOTS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
