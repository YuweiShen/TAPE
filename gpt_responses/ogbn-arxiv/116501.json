It also involves graph algorithms and computational complexity, which could fall under cs.DS and cs.CC. The use of FPTAS suggests that the paper may involve approximation algorithms, which could fall under cs.AI. Finally, the paper discusses mean-payoff games on graphs, which could fall under cs.CG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
