It also discusses heuristics and optimization techniques, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper presents a method for addressing the curse of dimensionality, which is a problem in control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses experiments with a two-arm manipulation robot, which is related to computer vision (cs.CV).
