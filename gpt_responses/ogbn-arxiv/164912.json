The paper specifically focuses on embeddings of graphs on surfaces, which suggests that it belongs to the computational geometry (cs.CG) sub-category. The algorithms presented in the paper also involve data structures (cs.DS) and graph theory (cs.GT). Additionally, the paper uses homotopy theory and oriented homeomorphisms, which are topics in algebraic topology (cs.SD). Finally, the paper involves mathematical characterizations and proofs, which suggests that it may also belong to the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
