This involves considerations of signal processing, communication theory, and network infrastructure. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the mathematical foundations of communication systems. \n\nThe paper also involves aspects of networking and wireless communication, which could fall under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the implementation restrictions and power efficiency considerations could be relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.MM (Multimedia), respectively. Finally, the paper could also be relevant to cs.COM (Computers and Society), as it discusses the practical implications of MIMO techniques in real-world communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
