This problem is closely related to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), as well as control systems (cs.SY) and robotics (cs.RO). The proposed algorithm uses Gaussian processes, which are commonly used in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG, cs.NE). Therefore, these five categories are the most likely to contain this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
