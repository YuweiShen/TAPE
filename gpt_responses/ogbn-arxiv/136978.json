The use of normalization techniques such as Batch Normalization and Group Normalization suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also applies the proposed method to various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, indicating that it may also belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
