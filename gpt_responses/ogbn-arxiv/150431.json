This concept may have applications in computational geometry, such as in the study of graph embeddings. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents an algorithmic result, namely that DAT-free digraphs can be recognized in polynomial time. This result may be of interest to researchers in data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
