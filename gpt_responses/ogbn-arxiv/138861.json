The focus on constrained devices suggests a focus on resource-constrained systems, which could fall under the categories of Internet of Things (cs.IOT), Distributed Computing (cs.DC), and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). The discussion of applications and challenges also suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
