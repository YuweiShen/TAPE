The paper proposes a method that combines structural context models with spatial and temporal models to better predict interaction classes. This involves using long short term memory (LSTM) networks to capture the dependency of global and local contexts of each RGB frame and each optical flow image. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the use of LSTM networks suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The focus on human-robot interaction and video surveillance suggests that the paper may also belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the use of video sequences suggests that the paper may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
