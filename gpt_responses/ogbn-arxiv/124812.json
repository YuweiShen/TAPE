The model uses a differentiable forking mechanism and a recurrent controller to execute functional neural modules, which are techniques commonly used in deep learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the reduction in learnable parameters, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
