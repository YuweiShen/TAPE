The focus of the paper is on safety-critical use cases, such as Vulnerable Road User (VRU), which suggests a potential connection to computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses system scalability, which could be related to control systems (cs.SY) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper mentions modeling and performance comparison, which could be related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
