The paper also discusses the concept of conflict-serializability (CSR), which is a commonly used correctness criterion in databases (cs.DB). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of conflict notions and correctness criteria, which are relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of STM systems, which is relevant to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
