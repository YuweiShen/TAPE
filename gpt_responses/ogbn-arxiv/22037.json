The use of $k$-cores and core numbers is a common technique in this area, which suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of computing core numbers in large graphs, which could also place it in the cs.SD (Software Development) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-categories. The use of probabilistic subgraphs in network experimentation suggests a potential fit with the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category, while the empirical validation of the proposed method could also place it in the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
