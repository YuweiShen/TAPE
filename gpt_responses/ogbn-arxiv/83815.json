Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes an architecture for implementing the blind detection scheme, which involves designing and optimizing algorithms and hardware, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.AR (Architecture) likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper deals with system-level issues such as latency and resource usage, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
