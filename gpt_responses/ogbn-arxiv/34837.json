This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. The paper also proposes a new feature reconstruction metric learning, which involves disentangling identity and pose, which could fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. The experiments are conducted on face datasets, which could also fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the paper proposes a method for feature reconstruction, which could fall under the neural networks (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
