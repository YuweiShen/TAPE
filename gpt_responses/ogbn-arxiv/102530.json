The focus on grid-like topologies suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of graph theory and combinatorics (cs.DS). The use of hypergraph independent set approach and generalized Sidon sets suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of algorithms and complexity (cs.SI) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
