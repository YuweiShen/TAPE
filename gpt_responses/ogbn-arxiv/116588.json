The proposed approach involves ordering patches in high-dimensional space, which could also be related to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of one-dimensional smoothing operations suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
