The use of transformations to achieve polarization is a common technique in this field, and the paper specifically considers a generalization of Ar\\i kan's polar code construction. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of coding theory (cs.SI). The paper also involves analyzing the behavior of these transformations on binary-input memoryless channels, which falls under the sub-category of communication complexity (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper may be relevant to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG) due to the use of matrix transformations and the potential applications of channel polarization in these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
