The model uses stochastic processes to refine its predictions, which is a common technique in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The model achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks, which suggests that it may also be relevant to Natural Language Processing (cs.NE) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) subfields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
