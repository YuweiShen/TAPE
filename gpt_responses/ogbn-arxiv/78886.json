The paper also discusses the use of worst-case optimal plans, which are commonly used in data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.DC). The cost-based optimizer and adaptive technique described in the paper involve making decisions based on metrics and heuristics, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
