The paper proposes an adaptive modulation scheme that uses quantized knowledge of CSI at the transmitters, which is also a common topic in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with wireless communication, which is a common topic in networking and internet architecture. The paper proposes a scheme that uses minimal feedback overhead, which is also a common concern in networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking) - The paper deals with communication over a multiple access channel, which is a classic problem in communication and networking. The paper proposes an adaptive modulation scheme that improves throughput and error performance, which is also a common goal in communication and networking. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a scheme that adapts to the existing channel conditions, which is a common topic in systems and control. The paper also deals with the problem of optimizing the modulation scheme, which is also a common topic in systems and control. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the problem of transmission over a channel with finite constellation at the input, which is a common concern in multimedia applications"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
