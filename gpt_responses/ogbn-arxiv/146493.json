This is a classic problem in computer vision, and the paper proposes a novel approach to solve it. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new method to automatically construct accurate road network maps from aerial images using a CNN-based decision function. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence, as it involves using machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses machine learning techniques, specifically CNNs, to detect which pixels belong to a road and to infer the road network graph directly from the output of the CNN. This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n4. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper deals with the problem of extracting road networks from aerial images, which involves processing and analyzing graphical data. This falls under the domain of graphics. \n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper proposes a method to automatically extract road networks from aerial images, which could be useful in robotics applications such as autonomous driving. This falls under the domain of robotics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
