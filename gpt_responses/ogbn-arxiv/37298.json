The use of deep learning techniques such as LSTM and convolutional layers also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the incorporation of contextual information, which could fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of LSTM also suggests that it could belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category.
