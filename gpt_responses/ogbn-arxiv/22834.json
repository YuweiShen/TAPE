It also involves constructing a computationally efficient code, which could fall under the categories of data structures (cs.DS) or distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also mentions regular variation, which is a topic in statistical inference and machine learning (cs.SI), and the code is shown to be less redundant than previous contenders, which could relate to the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
