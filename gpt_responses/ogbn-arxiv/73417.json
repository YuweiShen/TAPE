The paper also presents a comparative study of two methods for performing peduncle detection, which involves computer vision techniques such as colour and geometric features and deep neural networks, indicating the relevance of computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in the research. Finally, the paper evaluates the system in a greenhouse, which suggests the involvement of control systems (cs.SY) in the research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
