The use of attention and recurrent models also suggests that it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The fact that it is a fully differentiable model that can be trained using gradient methods suggests that it could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of auxiliary tasks to improve training convergence suggests that it could belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
