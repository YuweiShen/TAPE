The paper also involves the use of neural networks, which falls under the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the efficiency of the proposed approach, which could be categorized under Systems and Control (cs.SY). The use of embeddings and nearest-neighbor search could be categorized under Information Retrieval (cs.IR) or Signal Processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of acoustic word embeddings, which could be categorized under Sound (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
