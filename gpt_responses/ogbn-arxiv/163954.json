The paper also discusses the training approach for the proposed model, which can be related to machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. The paper introduces a new type of neuron and layer models, which can be considered as a contribution to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.
