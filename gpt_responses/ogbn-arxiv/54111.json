The paper also discusses the suitability of the proposed tags for cross-lingual semantic parsing, which further supports its relevance to the cs.CL sub-category. \n\nThe paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it presents a new baseline result for universal semantic tagging, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques. \n\nAdditionally, the paper's focus on semantic analysis and formal lexical semantics may make it relevant to the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe paper's application of semantic tagging in the Parallel Meaning Bank may also suggest its relevance to the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which deals with the organization and retrieval of information from text. \n\nFinally, the paper's discussion of cross-lingual projection may make it relevant to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), which deals with the use of neural networks and evolutionary algorithms in natural language processing tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
