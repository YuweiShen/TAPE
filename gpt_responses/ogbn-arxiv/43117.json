This falls under the domain of computer vision, making cs.CV the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The dataset consists of video clips extracted from various types of online videos, ranging from movies to news broadcasting. This indicates that the paper deals with multimedia data, making cs.MM a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.SD (Sound): The paper mentions speaker recognition as one of the traditional research areas for person identification. This involves analyzing audio features, which falls under the domain of sound, making cs.SD a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper evaluates state-of-the-art models for person identification and demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-modal fusion. This indicates the use of machine learning techniques, making cs.LG a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper mentions the careful human annotation process for the dataset, which involves labeling the video clips. This falls under the domain of information retrieval, making cs.IR a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
