MIL is often used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) applications, as well as in information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) more broadly. The paper also discusses benchmark datasets and classifiers, which are commonly used in machine learning research and evaluation, suggesting that it may be relevant to the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
