The proposed solution involves the use of machine learning techniques such as artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM), which are commonly used in the field of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments are conducted on network connections selected from the NSL-KDD DARPA dataset, which is related to network intrusion detection (cs.NI). Finally, the paper proposes a visualization technique to display the classification results, which can be considered as a contribution to the field of visualization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
