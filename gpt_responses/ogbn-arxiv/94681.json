The proposed method uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn the temporal relation of actions, which is a popular technique in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also introduces new action attributes, which can be considered as a form of feature engineering and machine learning (cs.AI). Additionally, the method involves frame-level feature extraction and online linking, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
