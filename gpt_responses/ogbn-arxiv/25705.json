The paper proposes a metric for evaluating the adversarial robustness of DNNs, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the mathematical explanation of the proposed metric, indicating that it could belong to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category.
