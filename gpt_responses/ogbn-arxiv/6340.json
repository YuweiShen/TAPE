This falls under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of NAS is often applied in Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Neural Engineering (cs.NE) tasks. The paper also mentions the consideration of efficient multi-objective search, which could potentially fall under the category of Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
