The proposed method involves reducing the number of parameters in CNNs, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The regularization technique used in the proposed method is related to neural networks (cs.NE) and the language used in the paper suggests that it is applicable to natural language processing (cs.CL) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
