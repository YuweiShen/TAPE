The use of sum-of-squares hierarchy suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper's focus on matrix concentration bounds suggests that it may also be relevant to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
