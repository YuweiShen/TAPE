The paper also involves computational simulations, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of data from the TUNA corpus, which is related to natural language processing and could place it in the sub-category of cs.SD (Sound).
