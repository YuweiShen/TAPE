The use of multiple clusters for distributing the transmit antennas and the consideration of imperfect channel state information (CSI) suggest that the paper may also belong to the categories of multi-agent systems (cs.MA), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), signal processing (cs.SI), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
