The use of non-linear optimization also suggests a potential connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the focus on creating human-like shapes from measurements suggests a potential connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
