This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The use of modal properties extracted from vibration data also suggests the possibility of signal processing (cs.SD) being a relevant sub-category. Additionally, the use of these techniques for fault detection and classification can also be classified under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
