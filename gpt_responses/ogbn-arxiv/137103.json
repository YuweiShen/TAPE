The algorithm uses majorization-minimization optimization and exploits data sparsity to improve scalability. These techniques are commonly used in the sub-fields of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and optimization (cs.DS, cs.IT, cs.NA). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
