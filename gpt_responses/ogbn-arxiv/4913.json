The paper also discusses the properties of creases on these surfaces, which is related to the study of folding and unfolding of surfaces, a topic that falls under geometric rigidity (cs.GR) and graph theory (cs.GT). Additionally, the paper provides proofs and mathematical analysis, which could also place it under the sub-categories of symplectic geometry (cs.SG) or mathematical physics (cs.MS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
