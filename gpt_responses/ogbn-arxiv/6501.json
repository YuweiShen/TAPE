Therefore, cs.NI (Networks and Internet Architecture) and cs.IT (Information Theory) are the most likely categories. The paper also proposes a signaling scheme and discusses its properties, which falls under the category of communication systems (cs.COMM). Additionally, the paper proposes two distributed dynamic IM schemes, which can be considered as system-level design (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of coordinated beamforming, which is a technique related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
