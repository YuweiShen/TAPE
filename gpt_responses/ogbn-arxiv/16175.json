The paper also focuses on optimizing the learning capability of residual networks, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of shortcut connections and the improvement of performance on various datasets suggest the involvement of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper's focus on image recognition tasks and the use of convolutional neural networks suggest a possible connection to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
