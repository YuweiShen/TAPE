Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses interference-limited and noise-limited systems, which fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) respectively. Additionally, the paper uses numerical methods to validate the accuracy of the approximations, which falls under cs.MA (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
