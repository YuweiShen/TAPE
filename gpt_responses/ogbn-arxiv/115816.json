The paper also addresses the need for reliable and real-time communication, which is a key aspect of control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of Network Calculus (NC) logic, which is a mathematical theory used in the analysis of computer networks and communication systems (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the need for dynamic service-aware network (re-)configuration, which is a topic in distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper proposes the use of a SDN controller, which is a software system and falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
