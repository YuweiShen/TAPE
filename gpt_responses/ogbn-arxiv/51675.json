The approach involves pre-learning non-linear annihilation relations in the Fourier domain, which suggests that information theory (cs.IT) may also be relevant. The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the proposed scheme, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) or numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
