The paper focuses on the development of a decentralized algorithm for computing the optimal robust beamforming and power-splitting scheme with local channel state information (CSI) and limited information exchange among the transmitters. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the design of a communication system for SWIPT, which involves the transmission of both information and power. Information theory is a natural fit for this type of problem, as it deals with the fundamental limits of communication systems. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper considers a MISO interference channel, which is a type of wireless network. The paper also proposes a decentralized algorithm for computing the optimal beamforming and power-splitting scheme, which is a networking problem. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the design of a communication system, which can be viewed as a control problem. The paper proposes a robust transceiver design scheme that minimizes the total transmission power under worst-case SINR and EH constraints at the receivers. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the transmission of both information and power, which can"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
