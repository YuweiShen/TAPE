This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of mathematical models for weight estimation also involves machine learning techniques, making cs.LG a likely sub-category. The paper also involves image retrieval (cs.IR) as the weights are estimated directly from the images. Finally, the collection of fish data and the use of segmentation techniques can be considered as a form of graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
