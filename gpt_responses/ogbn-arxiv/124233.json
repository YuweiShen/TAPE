Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a new loss function and evaluation metrics, which are related to machine learning and optimization, suggesting that cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves image and video processing, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper proposes a new method for improving the robustness of facial landmark detection, which involves training and optimization of the model, indicating that cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
