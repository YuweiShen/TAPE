Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Additionally, the paper discusses techniques for dealing with boolean sorts in theorem provers, which could fall under cs.PL (Programming Languages) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the TPTP language, which is used for automated theorem proving, suggesting a possible fit with cs.SE (Software Engineering) or cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
