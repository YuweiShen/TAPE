The method uses deeplabv3+ network to segment the image captured by the camera and the segmentation result is merged with the point clouds collected by the LIDAR. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper proposes a method for constructing high-precision maps for autonomous vehicles. The accurate segmentation of lane markings is crucial for safe and efficient navigation of autonomous vehicles. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep neural network for lane marking semantic segmentation. The network includes a long short-term memory (LSTM) structure to assist the network for semantic segmentation of lane markings by using the time series information. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for automated construction of high-precision maps for autonomous vehicles. The method uses deep neural networks for lane marking semantic segmentation. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper proposes a method for semantic segmentation of lane markings using deep neural networks. The method uses both image and point cloud data, and the network includes an LSTM structure to assist with semantic segmentation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
