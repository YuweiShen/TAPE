This suggests a focus on Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) and Graphics (cs.GR). Additionally, the use of mobile devices and Virtual Reality suggests a potential fit for Multimedia (cs.MM) and Virtual Reality (cs.VR) sub-categories. Finally, the study involves navigation of information spaces, which could also relate to Information Retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
