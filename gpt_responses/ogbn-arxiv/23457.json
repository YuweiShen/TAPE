The approaches discussed in the paper also heavily rely on computer vision (cs.CV) for object recognition and pose estimation. Additionally, the use of similarity matching and feature extraction involves machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG). Finally, the paper also touches upon the control and planning aspects of robotic grasping, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
