The use of discrete Morse theory and gradient vector fields suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the topological properties of 2-manifolds, which could fall under the sub-categories of graph theory (cs.GT) or geometric topology (cs.GR). Finally, the use of expansion frames and pseudo-optimality criteria suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of computational topology (cs.SG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
