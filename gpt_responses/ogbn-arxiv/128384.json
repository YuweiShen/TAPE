This is a common problem in machine learning, and the paper proposes an algorithm for maximum a posteriori (MAP) parameter estimation with an entropic prior. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the use of an entropic prior in MAP estimation, which is a concept from information theory. The paper also mentions the lack of conjugacy between the entropic prior and the multinomial distribution, which is a topic of interest in information theory. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): There is no direct mention of social or information networks in the paper, but the method proposed could potentially be applied in these domains. For example, the sparsity-inducing penalty term could be used to model the assumption that only a few nodes in a network are active at any given time. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for parameter estimation with an entropic prior, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence. The paper also mentions the use of this method in probabilistic latent audio source decomposition, which is a problem that could be tackled using various AI techniques. \n- cs.SD (Sound): The paper mentions the use of the proposed method in probabilistic latent audio source decomposition, which"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
