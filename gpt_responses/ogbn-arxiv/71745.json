The paper also discusses network formation and stability, which falls under the category of algorithms and data structures, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the dissemination of information, which falls under the category of information theory, making cs.IT (Information Theory) a likely sub-category.
