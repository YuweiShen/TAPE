Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of multilayer Perceptron training, which falls under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of supervised layer-wise pretraining (SLP) and adding new features, which are techniques commonly used in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the evaluation of different algorithms and features, which falls under the sub-category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper deals with the recognition of handwritten symbols, which is a common problem in Natural Language Processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
