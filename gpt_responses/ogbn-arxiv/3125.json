The proposed method also relaxes the requirement for all users to transmit their uplink pilots over the same set of symbols, which is a topic related to networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the achievable rate and mean-squared error of the covariance matrix estimate, which are topics related to statistical inference (cs.SI). The proposed method is specifically designed for massive MIMO systems, which is a topic related to machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, the paper compares the performance of the proposed method with existing methods, which is a topic related to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
