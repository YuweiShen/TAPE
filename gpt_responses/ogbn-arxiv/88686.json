This involves analyzing movement patterns and building models suited to different time periods. This suggests that the paper could belong to the following sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the development of intelligent agents that can learn from data and make predictions. The paper's focus on building models to predict future locations of moving objects fits well within this sub-category. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the development of algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions. The paper's use of historical trajectory data to build models for predicting future locations of moving objects suggests that it could belong to this sub-category as well. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This sub-category deals with the analysis of social and information networks. The paper's focus on analyzing movement patterns of objects could fit within this sub-category, as it involves analyzing patterns of movement within a network. \n- cs.DB (Databases): This sub-category deals with the management and analysis of large datasets. The paper's use of historical trajectory data suggests that it could belong to this sub-category as well, as it involves managing and analyzing a large dataset of trajectories. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category deals with the retrieval of information from large datasets.
