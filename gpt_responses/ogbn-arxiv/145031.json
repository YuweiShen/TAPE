The use of neural networks and the proposed dynamics embedding architecture suggest a focus on deep learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The mention of contrastive divergence, score matching, and noise-contrastive estimation suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV). The use of Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo and the mention of non-local contrastive objectives suggest a connection to computational neuroscience and systems biology (cs.NE, cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
