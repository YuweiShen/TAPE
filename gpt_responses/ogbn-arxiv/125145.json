The paper also proposes two algorithms to find a strong Stackelberg equilibrium, which is a standard solution concept of the Stackelberg game. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes algorithms to solve the Stackelberg budget allocation game, which involves optimization and algorithmic design. \n3. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper deals with a market leader and a follower, which can be seen as two agents in a multi-agent system. The paper also proposes a game-theoretic model to capture the interaction between the two agents. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with computational advertising, which is a subfield of information retrieval that focuses on designing efficient marketing strategies. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper uses a bipartite influence model to capture the influence of customers on advertisers, which can be seen as a type of social network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
