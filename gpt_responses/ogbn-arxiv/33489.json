The paper also discusses the adaptation and combination of nodes in the network, which falls under the Networked and Distributed Systems (cs.NI) sub-category. The use of adaptive combiners and theoretical analysis of the proposed scheme suggest that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.MA) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
