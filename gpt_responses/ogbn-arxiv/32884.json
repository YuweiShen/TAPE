The proposed method involves graph reasoning and message passing, which are techniques commonly used in multimedia analysis (cs.MM). The paper also involves similarity learning, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of graph convolutional networks also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper involves natural language processing techniques for text-based retrieval, which suggests a connection to computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
