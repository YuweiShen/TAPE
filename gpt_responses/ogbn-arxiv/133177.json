The paper also discusses different communication models and protocols, which are relevant to network engineering (cs.NE) and information theory (cs.IT). The analysis of the discrete case involves non-linear behavior and rounding errors, which are topics in scientific computing (cs.SI) and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
