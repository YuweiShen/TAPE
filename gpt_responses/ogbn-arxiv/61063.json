The use of lattice-based coding schemes suggests a focus on network information theory (cs.NI). The consideration of channel states and their impact on the achievable rate regions suggests a possible fit for the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The use of power constraints and noise variance suggests a possible fit for the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the study of capacity regions and achievable rate regions suggests a possible fit for the computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
