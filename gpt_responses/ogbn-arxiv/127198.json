This topic falls under the intersection of several sub-fields in computer science, including systems and control (cs.SY), embedded systems (cs.ET), electromagnetics (cs.EM), computer engineering (cs.CE), and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). However, given the focus on control theory and battery aging, cs.SY and cs.ET are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.EM, cs.CE, and cs.DC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
