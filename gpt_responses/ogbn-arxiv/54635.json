The paper also involves the design of network topology and sensor placement, which can be categorized under information theory (cs.IT) and network science (cs.NI). The use of measurement and predictor-fusion techniques suggests the involvement of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.MA). Finally, the paper uses structured systems theory to derive its results, which can be categorized under distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
