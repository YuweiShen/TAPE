This falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also proposes a game-theoretic characterization to account for a locally connected communication network over DERs, which falls under the category of game theory (cs.GT). The use of distributed algorithms for achieving equilibrium suggests the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The paper also deals with the dynamics of the real system caused by the DERs, which falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper deals with the communication network over DERs, which suggests the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
