The paper specifically focuses on the covariance functions of networks with activation functions, which is related to the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE). The evaluation of the performance of the limiting Gaussian processes on benchmarks suggests a connection to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of MLPs with exponential linear units and Gaussian error linear units also suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the introduction of a framework for analysing fixed-point dynamics is related to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
