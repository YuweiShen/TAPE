The paper also discusses the use of a continuous manifold to represent a richer set of human emotions, which involves machine learning techniques such as deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the visualization of different notions of positive sentiment in different domains, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
