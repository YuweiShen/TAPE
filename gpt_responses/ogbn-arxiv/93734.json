Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories. The proposed approach is based on deep learning and involves training decoders to regress the word embedding of the next word with respect to the previous ones, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach using the MS-COCO dataset, which is a popular benchmark for image captioning, indicating that it may also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
