Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the purpose of residual skip connections and their impact on feature refinement, which falls under the scope of machine learning and neural networks. This suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses qualitative visualization and empirical analysis to explore the purpose of residual skip connections, which could fall under the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
