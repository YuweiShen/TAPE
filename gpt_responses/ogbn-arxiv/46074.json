The use of parallelism in processing nodes and CPUs suggests a focus on distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The algorithms presented for parallel query optimization suggest a focus on programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). Finally, the use of Spark executors in the experiments suggests a focus on distributed computing (cs.Distributed)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
