The paper also discusses the reduction of complexity in LP decoding, which is a topic related to computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of LDPC codes in communication systems makes the paper relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the analysis of the pseudo-codeword spectra of the codes is related to the study of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
