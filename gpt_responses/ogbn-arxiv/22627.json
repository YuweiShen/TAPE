It involves the use of source-channel coding analyses based on the metric of distortion for secrecy. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the vulnerability of optical networks to physical layer attacks, which falls under the sub-category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). The specific application of the study to multimode fiber transmission suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the tradeoffs between transmission rate and distortion, which is a topic that falls under the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
