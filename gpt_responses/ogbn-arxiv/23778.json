Additionally, the paper also discusses biologically-motivated learning rules, which is a common theme in the cs.NE sub-category.\n\nThe paper could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it deals with learning algorithms and their performance on a specific dataset. The use of skip connections is a common technique in deep learning, and the paper explores the necessity of this technique in biologically-motivated learning rules.\n\nComputer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) is another likely sub-category as the paper uses the MNIST dataset, which is a standard benchmark dataset in computer vision. The paper also discusses the performance of different learning rules on this dataset, which is a common theme in the cs.CV sub-category.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (cs.AI) is another possible sub-category as the paper deals with learning algorithms and their performance on a specific task. The paper also discusses biologically-motivated learning rules, which is a common theme in the cs.AI sub-category.\n\nFinally, the paper could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category as it deals with the performance of different learning rules on a specific task and explores the necessity of skip connections in biologically"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
