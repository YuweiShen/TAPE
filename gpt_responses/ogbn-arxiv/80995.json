The paper proposes a new problem called the \"k-boosting problem\" and presents efficient algorithms to solve it. The problem is related to influence maximization (IM) and has applications in marketing, public health, and social media. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SOC (Computational Social Science). The paper also involves designing algorithms and analyzing their performance, which suggests that it could be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper uses real social networks and synthetic bidirected trees to conduct experiments, which could be relevant to cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
