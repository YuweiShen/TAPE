Additionally, the paper discusses mutation operators aimed at improving the efficiency and expandability of the evolved system, which are common topics in the Neural and Evolutionary Computing field. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of a hierarchical/modular topology, which is a common feature in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) research. \n\nThe paper's focus on control tasks and the use of sensors and actuators suggests that it may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper's comparison of DXNN to other state of the art TWEANNs suggests that it may also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category, as TWEANNs are commonly used in robotics research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
