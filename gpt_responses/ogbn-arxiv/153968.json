It also involves empirical studies to evaluate the proposed method. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) as softmax is widely used in natural language processing. \n\nAdditionally, it could be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision) as softmax is commonly used in image classification tasks. \n\ncs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another possible sub-category as softmax is used in many AI applications. \n\nFinally, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a possible sub-category as the proposed method relies on the model's last hidden layer, which is a common component of neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
