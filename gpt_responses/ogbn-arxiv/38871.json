The paper also discusses challenges in training deep neural networks, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of a novel learning framework and loss formulation suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also discusses theoretical insights into the advantages of learning on hyperspheres, which suggests that it may belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses experiments that involve classification, which suggests that it may also belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
