The use of Markov decision processes suggests a focus on control and optimization, which are also studied in the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also presents numerical simulations, which could place it in the Machine Learning (cs.MA) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the trade-off between orthogonal and symmetric systems, which could be related to Game Theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
