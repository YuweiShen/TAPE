Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses information theory and signal processing techniques for NOMA, which falls under cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses system-level optimization and control, which falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses multimedia communication and cloud computing, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation challenges and open issues, which falls under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
