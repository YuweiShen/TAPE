The paper proposes a novel method that jointly models geometry and appearance across views, which is a popular research topic in computer vision and machine learning. The paper also introduces a new large-scale dataset and an annotation tool for multi-view instance detection, which is relevant to multimedia and robotics. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
