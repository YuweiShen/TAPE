The paper also introduces a type discipline to guarantee the soundness of reduction rules, which is related to the field of logic in computer science (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper uses term rewriting rules, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and formal language theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper models a toy system, which involves programming language concepts (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
