It is also likely to belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as DNNs are widely used in image processing. Additionally, it could belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as the vulnerability of DNNs to adversarial attacks is a security issue. It could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as DNNs are a popular AI technique. Finally, it could belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as the paper deals with the vulnerability of neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
