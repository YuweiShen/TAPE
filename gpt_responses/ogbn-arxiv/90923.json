Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which includes topics related to natural language processing and computational linguistics. \n\nThe paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques, as summarization can be seen as a form of information retrieval. Therefore, cs.IR is another likely category. \n\nThe use of machine learning techniques, such as word embeddings, suggests that the paper could also fit into the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category. \n\nAdditionally, the paper involves the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to improve summarization evaluation, which makes cs.AI a possible category. \n\nFinally, the use of word embeddings to measure semantic similarity is related to neural networks, which suggests that cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) could also be a relevant category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
