It could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as it involves analyzing information-seeking conversations. Additionally, the paper discusses the design of conversational search systems, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.HCI (Human-Computer Interaction). The use of crowdsourcing for annotations could also make it relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks).
