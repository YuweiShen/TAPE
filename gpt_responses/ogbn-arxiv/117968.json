This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of arXiv CS, including Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), and Sound (cs.SI). The focus on noise robustness suggests that cs.IT and cs.SP are the most likely categories, followed by cs.LG, which deals with optimization and machine learning techniques. The use of different minimization norms also suggests a numerical analysis component, which could place the paper in cs.NA. Finally, the application of the algorithm to examples of sound signals could also justify a classification in cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
