The paper discusses the use of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to solve the optimization problem. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of FSO technology, which falls under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of adaptive adjustments to transmission power and optical beam-width, which falls under the category of cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
