The use of machine learning algorithms for this application also suggests the possibility of utilizing techniques from machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions the importance of aiding doctors in their decision-making process, which falls under the category of medical informatics (cs.MED). Finally, the visualization of class activation mappings is a technique commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) to understand the decision-making process of neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
