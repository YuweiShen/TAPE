This is a common problem in robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The algorithm also uses bidirectional search and adaptive heuristics, which are topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the algorithm in a programming language (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
