Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel end-to-end learning framework, which involves training a model using weakly-supervised multi-view data. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper proposes a new objective function that can only be minimized when the predictions of the trained model are consistent and plausible across all camera views. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the sub-categories cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
