This paper proposes a method to support difficult re-finding tasks by asking the user a list of questions about the target file and using the user's answers to filter out the target. This approach is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also mentions the use of keywords (cs.CL) and accumulated reading time (cs.CY) as attributes for re-finding. Additionally, the paper discusses the generation of re-finding tasks based on the user's own document corpus, which is related to deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
