This topic is closely related to network protocols and communication systems, which are covered in the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-category. The paper also proposes two coding approaches for multi-destination aggregation, which involve information theory and coding theory, respectively. Therefore, the paper may also fit into the cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper presents theoretical and simulation results for both unicast and multicast traffic, which may fall under the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the performance gains achieved through software changes, which may relate to the cs.DS (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
