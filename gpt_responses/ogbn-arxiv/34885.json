This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of neural networks also suggests the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). The paper also discusses communication costs, which could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper's focus on improving training could also fall under the category of robotics (cs.RO), as DRL is often used in robotics applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
