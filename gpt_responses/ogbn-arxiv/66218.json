The paper focuses on the aggregation of local models and the impact of aggregation frequency on the success of distributed learning. The paper uses information theory to measure the mutual information between representation and inputs as well as representation and labels in local models and compare it to the respective information contained in the representation of the averaged model. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
