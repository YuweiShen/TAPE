The paper also discusses the NP-completeness of the problem, which is a common topic in theoretical computer science (cs.CC). The study of approximate versions of the problem involves optimization, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also mentions the concept of submatching, which is related to submodular optimization, a topic in both theoretical computer science and machine learning (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with matching problems, which is a topic in game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
