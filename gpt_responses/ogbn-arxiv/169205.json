The paper also introduces a new measure of repetitiveness based on attractors, which is a concept that has connections to computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper discusses the size of context-free grammars, which is a topic in computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
