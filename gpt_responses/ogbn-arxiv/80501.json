It also involves optimizing the spatial resolution of each block, which is a common technique in computer vision. The paper also falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it involves optimizing the architecture of neural networks using differentiable NAS methods. Additionally, the paper involves optimizing the overall depth distribution of the network, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also involves optimizing the transition probabilities between blocks, which is a common technique in neural engineering (cs.NE) and architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
