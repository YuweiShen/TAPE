This is a topic of interest in discrete mathematics. \n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper presents an isomorphism test for graphs of rank width at most k that runs in polynomial time. This is a topic of interest in computational complexity. \n3. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses fixed-point logic with counting and its ability to capture polynomial time on graph classes of bounded rank width. This is a topic of interest in logic in computer science. \n4. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): Although the paper does not explicitly deal with computational geometry, the concept of rank width and clique width are related to geometric representations of graphs. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents an algorithm for isomorphism testing and canonisation of graphs of bounded rank width, which is a topic of interest in data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
