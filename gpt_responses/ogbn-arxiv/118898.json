The paper proposes a novel approach for visual reasoning that combines the strengths of neural module networks (cs.AI) and monolithic networks (cs.LG). The model also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) to parse input questions into functional programs. Additionally, the model has potential applications in robotics (cs.RO) for tasks that require visual reasoning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
