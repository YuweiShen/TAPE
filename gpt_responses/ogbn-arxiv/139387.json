The proposed method also involves using pairwise similarity, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper mentions using the method for image classification, which is a common application of machine learning in computer vision. The paper also mentions the potential use of the method for cybersecurity (cs.CR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
