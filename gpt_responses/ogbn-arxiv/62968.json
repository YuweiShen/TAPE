This topic is closely related to cryptography and security.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which is a network of vehicles that communicate with each other and with the infrastructure. The proposed scheme is designed to improve the performance and survivability of IoV, which is a networking and internet architecture problem.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a batch verification scheme that aggregates monitoring data from multiple vehicles. This requires efficient data structures and algorithms to handle the large amount of data generated by IoV.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new scheme for monitoring data batch verification, which involves software design and implementation. The proposed scheme needs to be integrated into the existing IoV system, which requires software engineering skills.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the potential benefits of IoV, such as improving traffic efficiency and providing a comfortable driving environment. However, there are also concerns about the security and privacy of IoV. This topic is related to the social and ethical implications of computer technology."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
