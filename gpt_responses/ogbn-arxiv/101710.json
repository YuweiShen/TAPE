This approach can be integrated with state-of-the-art algorithms for variational inference or RL. The paper also emphasizes the ability of the proposed method to perform in settings where existing adaptive approaches cannot, without access to rewards at test time. Given these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, the paper includes experiments in visual domains, which suggests a potential fit with cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper's focus on control policies and dynamics estimation suggests a potential fit with cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
