Information theory concepts such as channel capacity and spectral efficiency are also mentioned. \n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper focuses on MIMO-OTFS, a communication system that combines the benefits of MIMO and OTFS. The paper discusses signal detection and channel estimation techniques for this system. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses a communication system and its components (modulation, signal detection, channel estimation) which can be viewed as a control system. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses a communication system and its performance in high-Doppler fading channels, which is relevant to wireless networking. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses a modulation technique (OTFS) that can be used for multimedia applications such as video streaming in high-Doppler fading channels."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
