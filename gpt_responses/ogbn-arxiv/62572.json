Specifically, it focuses on the decomposition of mutual information into redundant, unique, and synergistic contributions. This topic is closely related to several subfields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), social and information networks (cs.SI), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
