The proposed method involves using textural cross-correlation to characterise apparent feature motion in a single light field, which is a technique that falls under the category of graphics (cs.GR). The paper also discusses the application of the proposed method to structure from motion, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
