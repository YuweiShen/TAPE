As such, the paper is likely to belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves optimization problems, which could place it in the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category.
