The paper also discusses resilience to error, which is a common concern in cryptography (cs.CR). The use of compression techniques to reduce communication size is related to information theory (cs.IT). The paper also mentions the size of the output universe, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses leader election and selection protocols, which are common topics in systems and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
