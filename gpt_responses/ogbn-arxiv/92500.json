This topic is closely related to computational complexity theory (cs.CC) and algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The Tutte polynomial is also used in computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Additionally, the paper discusses the Tutte polynomial in the context of graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
