The paper proposes novel techniques to improve the precision and recall of entity retrieval for long concept queries. This problem is closely related to several sub-fields of computer science, including information retrieval (cs.IR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), databases (cs.DB), computational linguistics (cs.CL), and machine learning (cs.LG). However, given the focus on IR and NLP, cs.IR and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.DB, cs.CL, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
