The paper also discusses adversarial attacks and robustness, which are topics related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of stochastic coordinate descent algorithm and the absence of gradient updates suggest the paper may also be related to neural networks and optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
