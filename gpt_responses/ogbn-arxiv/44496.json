Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security).

Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of a prototype system, which falls under cs.SE (Software Engineering), and the evaluation of performance overhead, which falls under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
