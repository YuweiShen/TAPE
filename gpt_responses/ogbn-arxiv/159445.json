Additionally, it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories as it proposes a novel approach for learning saliency prediction. The paper also involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) as it deals with human eye movements and their fixation on images. Finally, it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category as it involves clustering and max-pooling transformations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
