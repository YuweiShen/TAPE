This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT), as it involves the study of the fundamental limits of communication over noisy channels. The paper also proposes algorithms for doing the relevant computations, which could fall under the categories of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Moreover, the paper discusses suitable graphical models for the computations, which could be related to the field of computer vision (cs.MM). Finally, the paper uses a data-driven approach to learn the auxiliary channels, which could be related to the field of emerging technologies (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
