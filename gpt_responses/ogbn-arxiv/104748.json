The use of list-reconstruction and lossy-equivocation also suggests a possible connection to signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also discusses the achievable region for Gaussian communication, which falls under the category of machine learning and statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
