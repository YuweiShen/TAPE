The application of the proposed method is in a brain-computer interface, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural engineering (cs.NE). The classification task involves visually evoked potential, which is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the application is in a brain-computer interface, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
