The paper provides an algorithm for this problem, which suggests that it belongs to the machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. The algorithm also involves selecting a good candidate distribution from among competing hypotheses, which suggests that it belongs to the data structures (cs.DS) and statistical inference (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the sample complexity and optimality of the algorithm, which suggests that it belongs to the data mining (cs.DM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
