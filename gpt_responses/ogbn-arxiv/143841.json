The model also involves the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model sequences, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper deals with knowledge graphs, which are a type of database (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
