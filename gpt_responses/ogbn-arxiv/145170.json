It also involves deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in computer vision research. The paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a novel algorithm for generating adversarial examples. Additionally, the paper may fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it deals with the ability of deep networks to fail on image recognition tasks. The paper may also belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category as it discusses the vulnerability of deep networks to adversarial attacks. Finally, the paper may fall under the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category as it involves the optimization of a loss function over a set of pixels/proposals for generating adversarial perturbations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
