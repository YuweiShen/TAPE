The authors propose a weighted rank-one optimization problem to estimate skills based on observations on an irreducible, aperiodic interaction graph. \n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper defines the worker interaction graph whose nodes are workers and an edge between two nodes indicates whether or not the two workers participated in a common task. The authors show that skills are asymptotically identifiable if and only if an appropriate limiting version of the interaction graph is irreducible and has odd-cycles. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with the problem of estimating worker skills from worker-task interaction data using a machine learning approach. The authors propose a gradient descent scheme to estimate skills based on observations on an irreducible, aperiodic interaction graph. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a weighted rank-one optimization problem to estimate skills based on observations on an irreducible, aperiodic interaction graph. The authors also characterize noise robustness of the gradient scheme in terms of spectral properties of signless Laplacians of the interaction graph. \n5. cs.SD (Sound): This category is unlikely, but the paper does not deal with any sound-related problems"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
