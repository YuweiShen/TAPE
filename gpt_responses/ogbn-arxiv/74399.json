The paper also discusses different design criteria for the input subset, which could fall under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). The algorithm developed to solve the problem is based on maximization, which could be related to optimization (cs.DS). Finally, the paper applies the method to a mono-bit transceiver MIMO system, which could be related to networking (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
