The paper also mentions the use of specialized hardware to exploit sparsity for performance improvement, which could fall under the category of embedded systems (cs.ET) or systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents an analysis methodology for understanding the performance limits of DNN processors, which could fall under the category of architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
