The paper also mentions the use of double cosets, which is a topic in group theory (cs.GT). The study of self-dual codes is also related to algebraic coding theory, which falls under the category of discrete structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the enumeration of equivalence classes, which is a topic in combinatorics and discrete mathematics (cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of algorithms for enumeration, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
