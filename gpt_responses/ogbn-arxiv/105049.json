Therefore, cs.DB and cs.IR are likely categories. The problem is also related to data streaming and sublinear space algorithms, which suggests cs.DS and cs.SI as possible categories. Finally, the paper presents an experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm, which involves measuring the accuracy of the estimates, suggesting cs.LG as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
