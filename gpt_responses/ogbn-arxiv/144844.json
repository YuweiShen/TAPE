The most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper deals with overfitting and generalization, which are core concepts in machine learning. The paper also discusses the brittleness of deep RL methods, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of training diversity, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.CV (Computer Vision) if the diversity is achieved through data augmentation techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
