This falls under the broad category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and specifically machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also touches on the topic of adversarial attacks (cs.CR) and the importance of trust in deep neural networks (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
