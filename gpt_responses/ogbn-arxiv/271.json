Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves concepts of arithmetic secret sharing, which falls under cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The use of codex in local decoding may also relate to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper discusses the query complexity of the decoding algorithm, which is a topic in cryptography and security, and may relate to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper involves the concept of degree of evaluation polynomials, which is a topic in algebraic geometry and may relate to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
