The method involves transforming the ECG signal into the time-frequency domain using the Short-Time Fourier Transform, which is a signal processing technique (cs.AI). The authors also use deep convolutional neural networks to learn features from the ECG samples, which is a computer vision technique (cs.CV). Additionally, the proposed method is specifically designed for cardiac monitoring and diagnosis, which falls under the category of biomedical engineering (cs.BIO). Finally, the authors use a progressive decision fusion method to improve the accuracy and stability of the classification, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks and optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
