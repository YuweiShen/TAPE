The paper introduces two new algorithms that modify state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
