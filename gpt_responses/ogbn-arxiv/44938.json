The use of Tensorflow, Edward2, and Keras also suggests that the paper is likely to be related to topics such as deep learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and neural networks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
