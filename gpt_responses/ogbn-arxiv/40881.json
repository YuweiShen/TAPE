The focus is on investigating the susceptibility of ML-based CAD tools to adversarial perturbations and proposing strategies to mitigate the risks. The case study is on lithographic hotspot detection using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
