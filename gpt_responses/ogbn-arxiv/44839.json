The paper also mentions the importance of computational efficiency, which suggests that it may fall under information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the use of a novel pooling strategy for predicting image quality may involve machine learning techniques (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
