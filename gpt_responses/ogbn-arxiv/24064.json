The use of ultra properties related to linearity suggests a connection to proof theory and formal languages (cs.PL and cs.FL). The paper also discusses the properties of left-linear and right-linear/non-erasing TRSs, which are topics related to computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper mentions the transformation proposed by Sanut\u00b8ua and Rosu, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
