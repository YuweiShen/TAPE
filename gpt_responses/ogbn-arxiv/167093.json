The paper also discusses the use of the replica method from statistical physics, which is a technique often used in machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also presents a single letter formula for the mutual information and the minimal-mean-square error, which is a topic of interest in information theory (cs.IT) and statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the optimality of the approximate message-passing algorithm, which is a common optimization technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SP), and uses spatial coupling as a proof technique, which is a topic of interest in coding theory (cs.IT) and statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
