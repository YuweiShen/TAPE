The study uses Stack Overflow to mine indications of the frustrations that developers face when using computer vision services. The paper also discusses the implications of the findings via the lens of learning taxonomies to suggest how the software engineering community can improve these services and comment on the nature by which developers use them. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
