The focus on multi-agent coordination suggests that it may also fall under the sub-category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The use of actor-critic methods and ensemble policies suggests a focus on optimization and control (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
