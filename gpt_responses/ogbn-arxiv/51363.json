This is a problem that falls under the categories of information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), data mining (cs.DM), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the asymptotic regime, which suggests a focus on theoretical analysis and complexity, further supporting the likelihood of cs.IT and cs.DS as top categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
