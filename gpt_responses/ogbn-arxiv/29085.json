The focus is on zero-sum stochastic games, which fall under the category of game theory (cs.GT). The proposed approach involves using a belief distribution over possible environments, which is a common technique in control systems (cs.SY) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
