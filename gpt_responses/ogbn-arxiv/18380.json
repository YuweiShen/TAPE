The use of neural seq2seq models and their generalization ability also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the evaluation of the models on a large dataset (WikiSQL) and their performance improvement over a baseline model indicates a connection to databases (cs.DB) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
