The paper specifically focuses on larger-context machine translation, which involves considering the surrounding context in addition to the sentence being translated. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.CL (Computation and Language), which is the sub-category for NLP research. \n\nThe paper also discusses different approaches to generating missing context, including using a language model and a copy heuristic. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), which are both related to developing algorithms and models for intelligent systems. \n\nAdditionally, the paper discusses the use of back-translation to improve machine translation performance, which is a common technique in NLP research. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), which both involve developing neural network models for various applications. \n\nOverall, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL, followed by cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.NE, and cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
