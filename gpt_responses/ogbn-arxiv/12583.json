This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Zero-shot learning is a form of transfer learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. \n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper mentions the use of a semantic space (e.g. attribute space) for zero-shot learning, which is related to natural language processing and computational linguistics. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with object recognition, which is a common task in multimedia analysis and retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
