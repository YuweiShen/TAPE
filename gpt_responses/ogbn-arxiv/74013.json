The paper also presents a novel design methodology for the loading network, which can be considered as a system design (cs.SY) topic. The use of spatially multiplexed QAM signals and the comparison with conventional MIMO suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) and electromagnetics (cs.EM) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
