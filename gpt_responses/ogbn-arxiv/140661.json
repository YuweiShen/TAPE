The use of deep learning networks as an approximation of non-metric similarity functions suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The study of how these models generalize across different datasets indicates a concern with performance evaluation (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
