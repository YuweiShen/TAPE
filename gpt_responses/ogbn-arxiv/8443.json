The paper also proposes a novel text detector that uses iterative refinement and shape expression, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, hence cs.AI and cs.LG are also likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of feature extraction and geometric properties of text instances, which are related to information retrieval and computational linguistics, hence cs.IR and cs.CL are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
