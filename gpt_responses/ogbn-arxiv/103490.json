This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Signal Processing (cs.SI), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper specifically mentions group sparsity and multinomial logistic regression problems as examples of the proposed methodology, which further supports the likelihood of belonging to these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
