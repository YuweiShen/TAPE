Therefore, cs.SE (Software Engineering) is the most likely category. The paper also deals with the control flow graph of a program, which suggests that it could be relevant to cs.PL (Programming Languages) as well. The use of templates to describe program states is a logical approach that could be relevant to cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also mentions the size of the symbolic execution tree, which could be relevant to cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory). Finally, the paper deals with the analysis of program paths, which could be relevant to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
