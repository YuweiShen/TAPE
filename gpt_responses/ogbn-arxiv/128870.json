The use of rank-based approach and neighbor equivalence suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), which often deal with graph structures and algorithms. Finally, the mention of parameterized algorithms suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), which often deals with analyzing and optimizing algorithms on large-scale networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
