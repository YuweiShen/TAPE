This involves training multiple BNNs to control a vehicle in an end-to-end fashion on different sensor inputs provided by the system. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) a likely sub-category. The use of ensemble control and redundant control methodology makes cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible sub-category. Finally, the application of the technique to an autonomous driving task involves computer vision, which makes cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
