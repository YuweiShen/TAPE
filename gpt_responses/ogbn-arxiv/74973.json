Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the performance of different training methods and corpus sizes, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of lexicons and sentiment-specific word embeddings also involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of word embeddings in information retrieval (cs.IR) and cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
