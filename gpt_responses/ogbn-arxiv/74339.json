The paper also discusses the design and implementation of meta-reasoning systems, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper presents benchmarks for reasoning systems, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) who are interested in developing systems that can reason about complex formal systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
