The paper also discusses the use of ODEs and numerical integration methods, which are common topics in computational mechanics (cs.ME) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also mentions the use of the method in a sim-to-real manipulation task, which falls under the field of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the development of a new integrator, which falls under the field of computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
