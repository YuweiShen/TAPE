The proposed approach involves the use of a computer agent that infers tag-related object proposals under weak and strong supervisions, which requires machine learning techniques (cs.AI, cs.LG). The approach also involves linguistic and visual similarity between images, which suggests the use of natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
