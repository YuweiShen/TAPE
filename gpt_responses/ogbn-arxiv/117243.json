The proposed method uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to map the perceived surroundings to multiple trajectories, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The network is trained using a large dataset and evaluated in diverse and complicated real-life settings, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
