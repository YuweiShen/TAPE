The paper proposes a new non-tree spatial index based on Voronoi diagrams to solve this problem. This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the following sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of efficient algorithms and data structures for solving computational problems. The paper proposes a new data structure for solving the spatial nearest neighbor query problem, which makes it likely to belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms and data structures for solving geometric problems. The paper proposes a new spatial index based on Voronoi diagrams, which is a well-known geometric structure, making it likely to belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.DB (Databases): This sub-category deals with the design, implementation, and optimization of database systems. The paper proposes a new index structure for spatial data, which is relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category deals with the study of techniques for searching and retrieving information from large collections of data. The spatial nearest neighbor query is a common problem in information retrieval, making it likely that the paper belongs to this sub-category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
