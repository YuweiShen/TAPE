This falls under the domain of programming languages.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper focuses on leveraging MapReduce frameworks for large-scale, data-intensive computation, which is a key aspect of distributed and parallel computing.\n- cs.DB (Databases): MapReduce is often used for processing large datasets, which is a common task in database systems.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a tool that automates the process of rewriting code to leverage MapReduce frameworks, which is a software engineering task.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): While not the main focus of the paper, the use of program synthesis and theorem proving techniques to generate functional specifications could be seen as related to machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
