The proposed method uses deep learning techniques, specifically a lightweight model and feature distillation, which falls under the subcategories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates its method on three facial landmark estimation benchmarks, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the computational cost of the proposed method, which is relevant to neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
