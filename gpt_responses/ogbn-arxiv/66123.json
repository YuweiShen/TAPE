The paper also discusses regularization techniques and self-supervised learning, which are commonly used in deep learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of semantically meaningful features, which falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP), making cs.CL (Computation and Language) a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of neural networks, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (AI), making cs.AI a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of regularization techniques, which is a common technique in neural networks, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
