Therefore, the most likely category is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The paper also discusses various factors that influence trust, such as model interpretability and social transparency, which are relevant to AI (cs.AI) and cybersecurity (cs.CYBER). Additionally, the paper touches on the potential risks of AI decision-making, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of different AI models, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
