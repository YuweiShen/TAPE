The use of lifted graphs and randomization techniques is a common approach in statistical inference (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the complexity of the demodulator, which is a topic related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
