This suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) or Machine Learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing techniques for feature-based characterization of clauses, which could place it in the sub-category of Computation and Language (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the integration of the learned model with the core prover, which could relate to the sub-category of Software Engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper involves the use of a parameterized evaluation heuristic, which could relate to the sub-category of Programming Languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
