The paper specifically addresses the issue of noisy sensitive features, which is a problem that arises in many real-world cases. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses the use of noise-rate estimators, which suggests a possible fit with cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
