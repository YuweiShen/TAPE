The methods proposed in the paper are meshless and use radial basis functions, which are commonly used in numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the comparison of the proposed methods with other existing methods, which is a common practice in computational mathematics (cs.MS). The methods proposed in the paper are also applicable to problems in electromagnetics (cs.EM) and scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
