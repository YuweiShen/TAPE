The paper discusses the vulnerabilities introduced by the separation of control and data planes in SDN, which is a common concern in the field of computer security (cs.CR). The paper also proposes a countermeasure to strengthen SDN networks against fingerprinting attacks, which involves the use of cryptographic techniques and can be considered a system-level solution (cs.SY). The paper uses measurements and statistical analysis to demonstrate the feasibility of fingerprinting attacks, which involves the use of information theory and signal processing techniques (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses the implications of the attacks on the overall design and architecture of SDN networks, which is related to the field of distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
