This work involves examining a variety of model structures and components, and evaluating the proposed methods on MUPT datasets and the MUSK1 dataset. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.BIO (Computational Biology)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
