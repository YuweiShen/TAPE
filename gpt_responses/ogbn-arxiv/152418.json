It also proposes a multihop index coding technique to code the cached contents in helpers to achieve order-optimal capacity gains. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). \n\nThe paper also deals with information theory and coding techniques, which makes cs.IT (Information Theory) another likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper proposes a technique to reduce the deployment costs of distributed femtocaches, which is related to distributed computing. Therefore, cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) is another likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper deals with the next generation of cellular networks, which is related to systems and control. Therefore, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is another likely sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper proposes a technique to code the cached contents in helpers to achieve order-optimal capacity gains, which is related to multimedia.
