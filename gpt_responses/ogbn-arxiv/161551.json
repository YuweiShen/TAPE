The use of game theory to model the behavior of small cell base stations (SCBSs) suggests that the paper may also belong to the game theory (cs.GT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of context information to optimize resource allocation, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI).
