The paper focuses on extending the temporal logic rPATL for reasoning about players with distinct quantitative goals, which relates to either the probability of an event occurring or a reward measure. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper extends the temporal logic rPATL for reasoning about players with distinct quantitative goals, which suggests that it may belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper proposes probabilistic model checking techniques for concurrent stochastic games based on Nash equilibria, which suggests that it may belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents algorithms to synthesise strategies that are social welfare optimal Nash equilibria, which suggests that it may belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper applies its techniques to several case studies, including network protocols and robot navigation, which suggests that it may belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper implements its techniques in an extension of the PRISM-games tool, which suggests that it may belong to this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
