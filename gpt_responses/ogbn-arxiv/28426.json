The paper also discusses the optimization of network architecture and cost function, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of multiple input streams and the focus on video data also suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to the multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the proposed dissimilarity-based training approach involves the use of clustering and optimization techniques, which could also be relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
