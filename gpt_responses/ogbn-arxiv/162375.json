Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves image processing and computer vision techniques for generating synthetic training data, which suggests the possibility of cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) being a relevant sub-category. The use of machine learning models for OCR and text correction indicates the involvement of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories.
