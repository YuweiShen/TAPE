Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper utilizes contextualized embeddings like BERT, which is a popular technique in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses techniques for modeling long-range cross-sentence relationships, which is relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper specifically mentions named entity recognition (cs.NE) as one of the tasks it addresses."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
