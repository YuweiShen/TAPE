The paper also introduces sparse penalties and variable step-size algorithms, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the computational cost of the algorithms, which is a concern in networked systems (cs.NI) and multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
