This task falls under the domain of computational linguistics (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of word embeddings also involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the evaluation of different algorithms for semantic shift detection, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR) and classification (cs.CY) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
