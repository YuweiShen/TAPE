The proposed defenses are software-only and do not require changes to the operating system, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the categories of operating systems (cs.OS) and architecture (cs.AR). The paper also discusses memory isolation and physical memory allocation, which are topics related to software engineering (cs.SE) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
