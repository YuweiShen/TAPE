The use of spectral properties of graphs to approximate the capacity region suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of graph theory (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of computational bounds, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
