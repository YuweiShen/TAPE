This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also involves changes to the spread structure of existing codes, which could be categorized under computational complexity (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper uses mathematical optimization techniques, which could be classified under numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
