The paper also discusses the hardware implications of using reduced-precision computational units, which could fall under computer architecture (cs.AR) and neural engineering (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper uses optimization techniques to find the right quantization scale, which could also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
