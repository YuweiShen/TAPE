The paper also mentions the use of deep convolutional networks (cs.CV) and recurrent neural networks (cs.NE), which are specific subfields of deep learning. Additionally, the paper discusses the computational requirements for training these models, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
