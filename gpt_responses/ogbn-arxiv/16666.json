This involves training the model via imitation learning from an expert rule and demonstrating its effectiveness on a series of hard problems. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper deals with optimization problems, which suggests the sub-categories cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as possible choices."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
