The system leverages RTK GPS and IMU sensors to track the subjects and a real-time trajectory planning algorithm to transition between shots. This work involves robotics and autonomous systems.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper uses computer vision techniques to track the subjects in the real world and compute static shots based on visual composition principles. The paper also evaluates the performance of the tracking system.\n- cs.GR (Graphics): The paper discusses visual composition principles and cinematography literature to compute static shots and transitions between them. This work involves graphics and visualization.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper presents a system that captures video footage of human subjects in the real world using a quadrotor camera. The system leverages visual composition principles and cinematography literature to compute static shots and transitions between them. This work involves multimedia and video processing.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper presents a system that enables people to leverage the mobility of quadrotors and the knowledge of expert filmmakers to autonomously capture high-quality footage of people in the real world. The system is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to non-experts. This work involves human-computer interaction and user experience design."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
