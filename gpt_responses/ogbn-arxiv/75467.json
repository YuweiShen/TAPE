The paper proposes a novel technique for training neural-network policies using reinforcement learning (cs.AI) and policy-gradient methods (cs.LG). The approach also involves using both proprioceptive and exteroceptive measurements, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV) or systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
