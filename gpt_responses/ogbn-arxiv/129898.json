The use of a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) for free-space detection suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of robotics (cs.RO). The self-supervised training approach and the use of online training for the FCN indicate that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the application of the proposed algorithm in the context of Advanced Driver Assist Systems suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
