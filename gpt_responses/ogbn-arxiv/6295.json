The use of image data in the experiments suggests it may also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The fact that the architecture is meta-learned using labelled datasets suggests it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the use of natural language processing techniques in the paper suggests it may also belong to the computation and language (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
