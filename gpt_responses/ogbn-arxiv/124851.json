The paper proposes a new class of poisoning attacks that use clean-labels and are targeted. This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), cryptography and security (cs.CR), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
