The use of video data suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as another likely sub-category. The mention of EEG and ECG signals suggests neural engineering (cs.NE) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the use of deep learning methods indicates a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
