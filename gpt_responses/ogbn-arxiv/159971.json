The use of the term \"clone\" in the title and abstract suggests a connection to algebraic structures, which could place it in the category of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). The paper also involves the study of circuits and formulas, which could suggest a connection to Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The use of the term \"De Morgan basis\" in the abstract suggests a connection to Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper involves the classification of the complexity of a problem, which could suggest a connection to Symbolic Computation (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
