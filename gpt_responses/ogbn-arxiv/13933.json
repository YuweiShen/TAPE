The paper also identifies a set of typical affixes that users adopt to create highly related communities and builds a taxonomy of affixes. This suggests that the paper could fall under the categories of social media analysis (cs.SOC), natural language processing (cs.CL), cybersecurity (cs.CYBER), information retrieval (cs.IR), or social network analysis (cs.SI). However, given the focus on community interactions and taxonomy creation, cs.SI and cs.SOC are the most likely categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
