This involves using measurements of DC voltage, current, and cell temperature, as well as a model of the PV array. The paper also discusses the performance of different estimators in terms of accuracy, bandwidth, and robustness against measurement noise. The paper then applies the obtained PV maximum power values to train time series-based solar maximum power forecasting techniques. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (due to the use of machine learning techniques for forecasting), cs.LG (due to the focus on performance evaluation and comparison of different methods), cs.SY (due to the use of a model-based approach for estimating PV maximum power), cs.ET (due to the focus on energy systems and renewable energy), and cs.SE (due to the focus on system engineering and optimization of PV plant performance)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
