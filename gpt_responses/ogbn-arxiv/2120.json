The use of LP-rounding algorithms and reduction to related problems also suggests categories such as cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). Finally, the focus on approximation ratios and complexity analysis suggests a possible fit with cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
