The focus is on improving previously known algorithms for the problem of Generalised Pattern Matching, which is a well-studied problem in the field. The paper presents new deterministic upper bounds for various parameters describing the input instance, such as the maximum number of characters that match a fixed character, the number of pairs of matching characters, and the total number of disjoint intervals of characters that match the pattern. These parameters are related to data structures, combinatorics, and information theory, which are all subfields of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
