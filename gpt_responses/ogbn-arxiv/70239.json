The use of Gaussian kernel and the selection of kernel bandwidth parameter are also discussed, which are relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also proposes an extension of the Peak method for large datasets, which involves computational and algorithmic aspects of data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
