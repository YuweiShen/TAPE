The use of bounded Turing functionals also suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper involves the study of mutual dimensions between sequences, which is a concept related to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
