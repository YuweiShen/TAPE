The paper also considers hardware limitations, such as restricted number of active antennas, which falls under the networked and distributed systems (cs.NI) category. The large-system performance analysis using the replica method is a common technique in statistical physics (cs.SP) and machine learning (cs.LG) communities. Therefore, these five categories are the most likely candidates for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
