The proposed encoding method involves graph neural networks, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also mentions the premise selection task, which is a common task in automated reasoning and falls under the category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed encoding on a symbol guessing task, which is related to cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
