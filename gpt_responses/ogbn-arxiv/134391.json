This is a common problem in computer graphics and visualization, making cs.GR a likely category.\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper involves cutting the input model using a collection of simple cutting surfaces bounded by closed surface loops, which is a common technique in computational geometry. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of field-space sampling to obtain the set of cutting loops, which is also a common technique in computational geometry.\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper involves generating high-quality hexahedral meshes, which is a common problem in numerical analysis. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of localized non-hex elements when necessary, which is also a common technique in numerical analysis.\n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper presents a new algorithm for generating hexahedral meshes, which is a common problem in mathematical software. Additionally, the paper discusses the validation of the method by applying it to a large range of complex inputs, which is also a common technique in mathematical software.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although less likely than the other categories, the paper involves aligning with an input surface cross-field, which is a common problem"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
