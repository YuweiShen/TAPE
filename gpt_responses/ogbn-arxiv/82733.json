The use of neural networks for segmentation suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The mention of high-resolution images and small-size lesion regions suggests that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
