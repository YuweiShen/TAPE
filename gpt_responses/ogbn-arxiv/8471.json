The paper proposes a general pair-based weighting loss function for guiding the training of deep metric learning, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses samples mining and pairs weighting, which are relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.LG, cs.MM, cs.IR, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
