This falls under the category of web technologies and applications, which is covered by cs.WEB.\n2. cs.DC: The paper proposes a mechanism for packaging and loading resources from local storage, which can reduce the data traffic and load time of mobile web apps. This involves optimizing the use of network resources, which is a topic covered by cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing).\n3. cs.SE: The paper proposes a new approach for managing resources in mobile web apps, which involves modifying the architecture of the apps. This falls under the category of software engineering, which is covered by cs.SE.\n4. cs.PL: The paper proposes a new mechanism for packaging and loading resources in mobile web apps, which involves modifying the code of the apps. This falls under the category of programming languages, compilers, and software tools, which is covered by cs.PL.\n5. cs.SD: The paper proposes a new approach for managing resources in mobile web apps, which involves analyzing and updating the resources based on usage patterns.
