The use of deep convolutional neural networks for feature extraction and the proposed re-ranking algorithm suggest that the paper also belongs to the sub-category of cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper proposes a novel framework for VI-ReId, which involves training separate networks using different representations of input images. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of local pattern maps and Zernike moments transformation for feature extraction suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper deals with infrared images, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
