However, the focus on spectral efficiency and power control suggests that Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) are the most likely categories. The use of optimization techniques and the consideration of channel estimation also suggest Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) as possible categories. Finally, the use of massive MIMO systems specifically suggests Mobile Computing (cs.MM) as another possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
