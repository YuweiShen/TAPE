This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.CR sub-category.\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves the analysis of sensor datasets generated by smart homes to deduce a global sensor topology for a smart home. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.IR sub-category.\n3. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the use of IoT-based smart homes for healthcare, especially for elders, and the potential privacy concerns associated with it. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.CY sub-category.\n4. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the use of IoT-based smart homes for healthcare, especially for elders, and the potential privacy concerns associated with it.
