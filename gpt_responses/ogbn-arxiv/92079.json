The paper proposes a highly efficient DNN that simultaneously models association among indefinite number of objects. The paper uses Frame-wise Motion Fields (FMF) and Frame-wise Appearance Features (FAF) to achieve real-time MOT. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also uses DNNs for modeling association among objects, which makes it likely to belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with the problem of real-time MOT, which makes it likely to belong to cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
