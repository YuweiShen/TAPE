The paper deals with question answering, which is a common topic in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. The use of Common Crawl data and an off-the-shelf QA model suggests a focus on NLP and AI. The paper also mentions multi-hop QA, which involves reasoning and inference, indicating a possible connection to machine learning and data science. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) and data structures (DS) in its approach, making those sub-categories less likely but still possible."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
