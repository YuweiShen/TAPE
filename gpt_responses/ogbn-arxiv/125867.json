The paper also involves theoretical analysis of the algorithms, which suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of restricted isometry property (RIP) condition and iterative thresholding algorithms suggest that it may also belong to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. The paper deals with signal processing and optimization, which suggests that it may belong to the signal processing (cs.SP) sub-category.
