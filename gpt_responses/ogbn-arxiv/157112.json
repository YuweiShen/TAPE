It specifically focuses on information-flow security, which is a subfield of computer security (cs.CR). The paper also uses logical relations to prove the security of the proposed type system, which is a technique commonly used in the field of logic (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper addresses practical hurdles in implementing the proposed type system, which falls under the category of Software Engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper deals with declassification policies, which is a topic that falls under the category of Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
