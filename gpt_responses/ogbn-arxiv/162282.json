The use of a greedy strategy and the analysis of its optimality suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The application of the result to tree drawing indicates that the paper may also be relevant to graph theory (cs.GT) and computational complexity (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
