The proposed method involves modelling appearance information as latent variables, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). The method also involves assessing the adequacy of each view and adjusting their contributions, which suggests the use of optimization or control theory (cs.RO). Finally, the experiments involve datasets that are commonly used in multimedia applications (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
