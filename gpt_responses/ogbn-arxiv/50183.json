Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also focuses on multimedia streaming, which suggests that it could belong to cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper proposes an online coding scheme, which involves information theory, making cs.IT (Information Theory) another likely category. The paper also evaluates the performance of an existing multipath load splitting proposal, which involves distributed computing, making cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) another possible category. Finally, the paper discusses the selection of paths for redundancy traffic, which involves system design and control, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) another possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
