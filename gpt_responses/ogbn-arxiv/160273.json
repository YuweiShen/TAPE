The use of interference cancellation and diversity techniques also suggests a possible connection to information theory (cs.IT). The analysis of stability and throughput can be related to control systems (cs.SY). The comparison between different techniques may involve multimedia systems (cs.MM) and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
