It also involves the use of convolutional neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. \n\nThe paper also involves innovations in multiple aspects, including a new deformation constrained pooling layer and a new pre-training strategy. This suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. \n\nAdditionally, the paper involves the use of neural networks, which are commonly used in the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category.
