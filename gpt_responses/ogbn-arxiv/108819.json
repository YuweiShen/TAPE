The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for learning deep representations further supports this. The paper also involves the use of machine learning algorithms such as linear SVM, which suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of image processing techniques for feature extraction suggests that it could belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. The use of fusion techniques to combine deep and hand-crafted features suggests that it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of a smartphone application suggests that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
