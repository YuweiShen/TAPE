The paper also discusses the inapproximability of problems, which suggests that it could be categorized under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper mentions graph theory and expanders, which suggests that it could also be categorized under cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
