The paper also discusses statistical leverage scores, which falls under the category of numerical analysis (cs.NA). The use of embeddings and dimensionality reduction suggests a potential connection to information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper also presents an application to L1 tasks, indicating a potential connection to data structures (cs.DS) for efficient computation of L1-embeddings."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
