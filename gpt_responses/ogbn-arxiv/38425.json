This falls under the scope of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) as the tongue shape and motion are studied during speech production. The use of deep neural networks also suggests that the paper may fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) categories. Finally, the real-time aspect of the proposed method indicates that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
