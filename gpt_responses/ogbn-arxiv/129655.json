The paper also discusses the optimization of budget allocation, which is a common problem in information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper uses mathematical models and algorithms to analyze the behavior of advertisers, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of information asymmetry, which is a common topic in mechanism design (cs.MA). Finally, the paper uses machine learning techniques to optimize budget allocation, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
