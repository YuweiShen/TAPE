Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces a new module that can be adapted to different tasks, which suggests that it could be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the proposed module involves referring to information from other RoIs, which could be related to neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
