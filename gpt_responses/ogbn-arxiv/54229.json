The Ludii system, in particular, emphasizes machine learning techniques for game analysis and design. \n- cs.PL: Programming languages are a central component of GGP systems, and the paper evaluates two new game description languages (RBG and Ludii) in terms of their simplicity and efficiency. \n- cs.SD: Software development is also relevant to GGP systems, as they require specialized software to implement and run. The paper evaluates the performance of two new GGP systems, which is a key aspect of software development."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
