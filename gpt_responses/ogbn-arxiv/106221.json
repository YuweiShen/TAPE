The paper mentions the use of established methods like Bayes, Rocchio, kNN, SVM, and logistic regression as well as recent methods like Learning to Rank and neural networks. These methods are commonly used in the fields of information retrieval (cs.IR), natural language processing (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI), and deep learning (cs.DL).
