This involves learning the synthesizability of dynamic texture samples and selecting the most suitable exemplar-based dynamic texture synthesis (EDTS) algorithm to complete the task. The paper proposes a method for associating dynamic texture samples with synthesizability scores by learning regression models on a compiled dynamic texture dataset annotated in terms of synthesizability. This involves defining the synthesizability of DT samples and characterizing them by a set of spatiotemporal features, training regression models on the annotated dataset with feature representation to predict the synthesizability scores of the DT samples, and learning classifiers to select the most suitable EDTS algorithm. The paper also applies the learned synthesizability to detecting synthesizable regions in videos. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), multimedia (cs.MM), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
