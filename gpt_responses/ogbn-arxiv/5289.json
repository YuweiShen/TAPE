The use of preprocessing to improve efficiency is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper's focus on optimization and approximation algorithms may also place it in the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
