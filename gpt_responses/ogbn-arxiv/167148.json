The use of trace and norm functions also suggests a connection to information theory.\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Permutation polynomials are widely used in cryptography, and the paper discusses the construction of a new class of permutation trinomials. The use of Niho exponents, which are commonly used in cryptography, further supports this category.\n3. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The study of permutation polynomials is a topic in discrete mathematics, and the paper presents a new class of permutation trinomials. The techniques used to prove the permutation property also involve some special operations, which are likely to be of interest to researchers in discrete mathematics.\n4. cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The study of permutation polynomials can be related to the theory of finite fields and automata theory. The paper may be of interest to researchers in this area.\n5. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper may be of interest to researchers in game theory, as permutation polynomials have applications in coding theory and cryptography, which are important in game theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
