This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the effect of spatial correlation, which is a topic of interest in signal processing (cs.SI) and communication engineering (cs.CE). Additionally, the paper deals with the symbol-error rate, which is a metric used in multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
