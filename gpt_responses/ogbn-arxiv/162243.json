Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves information extraction, which falls under cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Additionally, the text recognition module uses attention-based encoder-decoder, which is a popular technique in natural language processing and falls under cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves pre-processing and OCR verification, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence, falling under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
