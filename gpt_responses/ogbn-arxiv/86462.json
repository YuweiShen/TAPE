This involves processing cepstrogram and generalized cross-correlogram inputs. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing): This sub-category deals with the computational analysis, synthesis, and processing of sound and music. The paper's focus on sound source localization in a multipath environment makes it a likely fit for this sub-category.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category deals with the modeling, analysis, and control of complex systems. The use of CNNs for source localization can be seen as a control problem, where the network is trained to estimate the location of the source given certain inputs.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the development of intelligent agents and systems. The use of CNNs for source localization can be seen as an application of AI, where the network is trained to perform a specific task.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the development of algorithms and models that can learn from data. The use of CNNs for source localization is a machine learning problem, where the network is trained on a dataset of labeled examples.\n- cs.NE (Neural"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
