The proposed architecture, Object-Scene Convolutional Neural Network (OS-CNN), is a deep learning model, which falls under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves investigating different network architectures, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
