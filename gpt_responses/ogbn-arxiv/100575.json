It also involves the analysis of the size and minimum distance of these codes, which could fall under network information theory (cs.NI) or coding theory (cs.IT). The paper may also be relevant to the study of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) as it proposes improvements to a specific construction method. Additionally, the paper may be of interest to researchers in computer communication (cs.CC) as network coding is a technique used in communication networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
