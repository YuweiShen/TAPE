The use of statistical approaches and lexical co-occurrence networks suggests that this paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the use of machine learning techniques and evaluation on a large corpus suggests that it could also belong to the sub-categories of Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
