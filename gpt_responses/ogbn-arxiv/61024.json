The paper proposes a novel targeted sparsity regularization strategy to counteract overfitting caused by activation sparsity and filter correlation in a layer-by-layer manner. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and natural language processing (cs.CL). However, since the paper focuses on image classification, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
