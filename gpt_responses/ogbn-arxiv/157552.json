The paper also mentions the use of GPU for faster processing, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper evaluates the system and compares it with a high-end commercial 3D scanner, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) techniques for performance analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
