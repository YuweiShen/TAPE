It also involves the use of physical laws to optimize energy transmission (cs.SY) and the integration of green energy sources into power networks (cs.ET). Additionally, the paper discusses the reduction of power loss on transmission breaches, which is related to the field of distributed computing (cs.DC) and the design of efficient communication networks (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
