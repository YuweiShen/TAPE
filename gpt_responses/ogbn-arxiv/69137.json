This involves information theory concepts such as channel estimation and signal processing. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): Full-duplex systems are commonly used in wireless networks, and the proposed scheme can improve the performance of such systems by suppressing nonlinear distortion. \n3. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper deals with self-interference cancellation in full-duplex systems, which is a key issue in wireless communication. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed scheme involves joint estimation of self-interference channel and nonlinearity coefficients, which can be seen as a control problem. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed scheme can be applied to improve the performance of multimedia applications that use full-duplex systems, such as video conferencing and streaming."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
