The paper proposes a refactoring system that automatically analyzes the application content based on a semantic or a visual criterion determined by the author or the user, and prepares it for the splitting process. This involves techniques from various sub-fields of computer science, including natural language processing, computer vision, and software engineering. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.HC, cs.WEB, and cs.IR, followed by cs.MM and cs.SD."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
