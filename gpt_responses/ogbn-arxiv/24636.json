The paper discusses the method for generating the structure and demonstrates its effectiveness on a number of experimental tests and applications. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a new method for generating a foam structure with graded density that is suitable for 3D printing systems based on filament extrusion. The method involves a space-filling surface that employs spatially varying subdivision levels and dithering of the subdivision levels to accurately reproduce a prescribed density distribution. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of 3D printing systems based on filament extrusion to fabricate foam structures with graded density. The paper includes images and videos to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper proposes a new method for generating a foam structure with graded density that is suitable for 3D printing systems based on filament extrusion. The method involves dithering of the subdivision levels to accurately reproduce a prescribed density distribution, which could be considered a form of image processing. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the use of 3D printing systems based on filament extrusion to fabricate foam structures with graded density."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
