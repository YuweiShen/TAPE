The proposed solution involves the use of Collaborative Deep Neural Networks (C-DNNs), which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the problem of decentralized scheduling can be seen as a control problem (cs.SY) where each transmitter makes a decision based on feedback from the environment. Therefore, cs.SY is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
