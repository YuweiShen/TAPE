The use of power allocation strategies and codebook ensembles also suggests a possible connection to optimization (cs.OH). The study of optical intensity channels and power constraints is also relevant to the subfield of optical networking (cs.NI) and photonics (cs.PHOTONICS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
