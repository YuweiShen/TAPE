The paper combines recent techniques of deep reinforcement learning with existing model-based approaches using an expert-provided state abstraction. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, the paper constructs toy domains that elucidate the problem of long horizons, sparse rewards, and high-dimensional inputs, which suggests that the paper may also be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
