The paper proposes a logic-compatible approach using model-based knowledge of environment dynamics and deadline information to directly infer non-stationary policies composed of reusable stationary policies. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics) - The paper proposes a method for synthesizing non-stationary policies for temporal logic planning, which is relevant to robotics applications where robots need to perform tasks that involve temporal constraints. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a method for learning policies that can satisfy time-sensitive goals while respecting time-varying obstacles, which is a problem that can be addressed using machine learning techniques. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a method for synthesizing policies that can satisfy time-sensitive goals while respecting time-varying obstacles, which is relevant to systems and control applications where there are temporal constraints on the behavior of the system. \n5. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper proposes a logic-compatible approach for synthesizing non-stationary policies for temporal logic planning, which is relevant to programming languages research where there is a need to reason about temporal constraints in programs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
