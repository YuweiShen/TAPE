The paper also focuses on robust steganography, which is a key aspect of secure data hiding. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with data hiding in multimedia, specifically in images. The proposed scheme is designed to resist common image transformations, which is a key concern in multimedia data hiding. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of data hiding for semantic search engines, which is a key application of information retrieval. The proposed scheme aims to enrich media with information related to their contents, authors, etc., which can improve search results. \n4. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper deals with data hiding in images, which is a key area of computer vision and pattern recognition. The proposed scheme is designed to resist common image transformations, which is a key concern in this field. \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper proposes a steganographic scheme based on chaotic iterations, which is a technique that has been studied in information theory. The paper also discusses the robustness of the proposed scheme, which is a key aspect of information theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
