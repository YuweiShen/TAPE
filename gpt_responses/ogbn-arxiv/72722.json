This falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also discusses sparsity and autoencoding, which are topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and systems and control (cs.SY). The algorithmic techniques used in the paper involve optimization and linear algebra, which are relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
