The paper analyzes the structure and properties of SPNs, and considers how well they can capture various distributions. This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), neural networks (cs.NE), and systems and control (cs.SY). Given the focus on deep generative models and their capabilities, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories. However, the analysis of the structure and properties of SPNs could also be relevant to cs.DS, while the discussion of the types of computations that can be performed efficiently by SPNs could be relevant to cs.NE and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
