The paper proposes a new graph aligner that uses the global structure of the graphs to reduce the problem size, which is a technique that can be applied to many machine learning and data mining problems (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of vertex and edge attributes to achieve a more accurate alignment, which is a common topic in graph-based machine learning (cs.LG). The paper proposes an iterative algorithm, which is a common technique in optimization and machine learning (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the use of the proposed technique for achieving higher recall, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
