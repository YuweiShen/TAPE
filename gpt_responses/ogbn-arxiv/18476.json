Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits and practical algorithms for reliable communication over noisy channels. The paper also discusses the system-level challenges and trade-offs in implementing backscatter systems, which could fall into cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper proposes a new encoding scheme and hardware design for backscatter tags, which could be relevant to cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) and cs.EM (Embedded Systems)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
