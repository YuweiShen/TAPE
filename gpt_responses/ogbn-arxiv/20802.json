This technique is analyzed in terms of degrees-of-freedom and feedback requirements, and is shown to outperform existing interference management techniques in simulations. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of communication systems. The paper also involves network infrastructure (base stations), which suggests cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as a likely sub-category. The proposed technique involves system-level optimization, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also deals with MIMO systems, which could be categorized under cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper involves communication systems, which could fall under cs.COM (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
