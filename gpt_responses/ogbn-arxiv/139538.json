The paper also involves machine learning techniques for improving the quality of region proposals and feature extraction, which makes it relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper proposes a new method for detecting oriented objects, which is relevant to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves experiments with deep learning models, which makes it relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
