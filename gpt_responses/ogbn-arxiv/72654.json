This involves techniques from computer vision (cs.CV) such as deep neural networks, as well as natural language processing (cs.CL) to understand the semantic relatedness between text and objects in the scene. Information retrieval (cs.IR) may also be relevant for ranking text hypotheses. Machine learning (cs.LG) is likely to be used for training the deep neural network. Multimedia (cs.MM) may also be relevant due to the use of images as input."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
