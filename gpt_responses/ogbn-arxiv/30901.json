The paper focuses on comparing the performance of the original deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm to its natural gradient counterpart (NGDQN) on classic controls environments without target networks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper's focus on control environments suggests that it could also be relevant to the sub-categories cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
