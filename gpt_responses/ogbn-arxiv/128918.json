The proposed solution involves using reinforcement learning (RL) to solve a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) problem, which falls under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the use of RL implies the use of neural networks, which is a subfield of computational neuroscience (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
