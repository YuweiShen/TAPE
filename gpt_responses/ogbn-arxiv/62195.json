This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and software engineering (cs.SE) as the paper proposes a solution to address security vulnerabilities. The paper also touches upon system and control theory (cs.SY) as it discusses the implications of a human driver on the security of the proposed solution. Additionally, the paper involves cryptography and security (cs.CY) as it discusses packet-injection attacks and denial of service attacks. Finally, the paper involves networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) as it discusses the communication protocol used in modern vehicles."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
