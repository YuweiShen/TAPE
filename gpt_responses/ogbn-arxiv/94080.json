This falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also uses discrete Morse theory, which is a tool from discrete mathematics and combinatorial topology, falling under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and graph theory (cs.GT). The paper also discusses homotopy equivalence, which is a concept from algebraic topology, falling under the category of geometric topology (cs.GT) and general topology (cs.GR). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implementation of the results, which falls under the category of scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
