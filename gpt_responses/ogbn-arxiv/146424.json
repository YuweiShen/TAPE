The use of POMDPs and AEB systems also suggests a robotics focus.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of POMDPs and the formulation of a policy suggest an AI focus.\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The problem of pedestrian collision avoidance involves perception of the environment, which is often done through computer vision techniques.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The use of POMDPs and the formulation of a policy suggest a machine learning focus.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The integration of the POMDP policy with an AEB system involves control of the vehicle, which falls under the systems and control category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
