Given that the paper proposes new layer architectures for CNNs on graphs, it is most likely to be categorized under cs.LG, followed by cs.CV and cs.AI. The use of neural networks and graph structures also makes cs.NE a likely sub-category, while the focus on information networks could make cs.SI a relevant category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
