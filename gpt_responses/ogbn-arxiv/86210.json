This falls under the broad category of information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the development of computational and data-efficient algorithms, which could be categorized under cs.SI (signal processing and machine learning) and cs.DS (data structures and algorithms). Finally, the paper's focus on network-coupled dynamical systems suggests a potential fit with the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
