The authors propose a deep learning approach to learn a fixed length feature representation of fingerprints, which involves training a convolutional neural network (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of domain knowledge to improve the performance of the network, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper involves large-scale search and matching of fingerprints, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
