The use of polynomial $\\ell_1$-optimization algorithm suggests numerical analysis (cs.NA) as another possible sub-category. The statistical approach mentioned in the abstract also indicates the possibility of the paper belonging to the sub-categories of statistics (cs.SI) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
