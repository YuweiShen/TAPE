The problem is modeled as matching problems on bipartite graphs, and the paper introduces a new robust model for the assignment problem that can deal with situations in which certain resources, i.e. nodes or edges of the underlying bipartite graph, are vulnerable and may become unavailable after a solution has been chosen. The paper presents algorithms and hardness of approximation results for several variants of the problem. Based on this description, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.RO (Robotics), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
