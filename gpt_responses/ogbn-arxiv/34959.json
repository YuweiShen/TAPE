This falls under the domain of systems and control, making cs.SY the most likely category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of autonomous functions in vehicular control systems, which involves the use of AI techniques. Therefore, cs.AI is a likely category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the development of a control system for an autonomous vehicle, which involves software engineering principles. Hence, cs.SE is a possible category.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the development of a control system for an autonomous vehicle, which falls under the domain of robotics. Therefore, cs.RO is a possible category.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the identification of critical scenarios leading to the violation of safety goals, which involves security concerns. Hence, cs.CR is a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
