The focus on cellular networks suggests that it could also belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The use of optimization techniques and the mention of convexity suggest that it could belong to cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
