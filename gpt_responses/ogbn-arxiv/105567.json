This involves the use of information theory concepts such as channel capacity and error probability analysis. \n2. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The proposed technique is aimed at improving the efficiency of radio-frequency energy harvesting and low-complexity information transmission, which are key aspects of communication and networking systems. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the design and implementation of a new SWIPT technique, which involves the use of multisine waveforms and non-coherent maximum-likelihood detection. These are relevant topics in systems and control. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed technique involves the use of wireless communication and energy harvesting, which are important aspects of networking and internet architecture. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of multisine waveforms for SWIPT, which can be considered as a form of multimedia signal processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
