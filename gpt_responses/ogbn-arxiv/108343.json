The paper also involves the use of neural networks (cs.NE) and computer vision (cs.CV) in its experiments. Additionally, the paper involves the use of adversarial attacks (cs.CR) to test the robustness of the models. Finally, the paper involves the use of noisy data and randomization techniques (cs.AI) to improve the performance of the models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
