The paper proposes new notions of higher order adjacency degrees, multi parameter boundary and coboundary operators, and a multi combinatorial Laplacian, which are all relevant to the field of Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the applications of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to complex networks, which falls under the sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) and Scientific Computing (cs.SD). The paper's focus on computational techniques and algorithms for analyzing simplicial complexes suggests that it may also be relevant to Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) and Computational Geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
