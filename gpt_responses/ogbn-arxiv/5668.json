This involves robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques, as well as machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) methods. The paper also discusses the efficiency and flexibility of the proposed solution, which relates to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
