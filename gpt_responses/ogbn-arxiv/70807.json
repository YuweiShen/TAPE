The use of fixed random values in the first layer is a technique that has been previously explored in Extreme Learning Machines, which falls under the category of neural networks and learning (cs.NE). The focus on convolutional neural networks suggests that the paper may also fall under computer vision (cs.CV). The discussion of generalization capabilities and robust representations suggests that the paper may also fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of deep neural networks for representation learning suggests that the paper may also fall under natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
