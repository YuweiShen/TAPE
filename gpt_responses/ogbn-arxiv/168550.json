This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates the effectiveness of the teaching strategies through human experiments, which could fall under natural language processing (cs.CL) or cognitive science (cs.CC). Finally, the use of neural networks suggests a potential connection to neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
