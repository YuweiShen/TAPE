The paper also mentions the asymptotic properties of these codes, which is related to number theory (cs.NT). The use of scaling laws to predict performance is a topic related to statistical physics (cs.SI). The development of analytic tools for code design is related to distributed systems (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
