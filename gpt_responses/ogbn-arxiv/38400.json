The paper also discusses the use of regularization techniques, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments in the paper involve regression models trained on image datasets, which suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) could also be a relevant sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses statistical measures such as KL divergence and CDFs, which could place it under the sub-category of statistics (cs.STAT). Finally, the paper deals with neural networks, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of computational neuroscience (cs.NEURON)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
