The paper also discusses model compression, which is a topic in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of convolutional neural networks for object localization in Atari games suggests a connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision). The application of these techniques to reinforcement learning agents suggests a connection to cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
