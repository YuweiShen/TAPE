The paper proposes a new normalization technique called central biasing normalization (CBN) to improve the performance of multi-mapping image translation models. This involves injecting latent code, which is a common technique in deep learning and falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves mathematical analysis, which could fall under the category of graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the paper deals with multi-mapping networks, which could fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
