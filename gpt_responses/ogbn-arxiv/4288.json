The paper also discusses training and inference processes, which are relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel quantization scheme, which is related to numerical optimization and could fall under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category.
