The paper also discusses the use of an electronic thesaurus, which is relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG) tasks. The automation of constructing lexical chains is a task that can be approached using artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques such as natural language processing and machine learning. Finally, the paper's focus on the design decisions made in implementing the algorithm suggests that it may also be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
