The paper presents theoretical methods and algorithms for measuring and eliminating redundant influence in order to maximize spreading influence. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SOC (Social and Behavioral Sciences), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity and Privacy)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
