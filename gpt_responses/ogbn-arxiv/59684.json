This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with image forensics and source identification, which is a sub-domain of multimedia.\n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the identification of illicit materials, which is a security concern. Additionally, the proposed solution can be used to claim intellectual property, which is also related to security.\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the identification of the origin of an image, which can be useful in image retrieval systems.\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a CNN-based solution for device identification, which falls under the domain of machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
