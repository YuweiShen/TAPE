The paper also discusses deep learning methods for representation learning, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments conducted involve face recognition and face attribute prediction, which are multimedia-related tasks (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of class re-sampling and cost-sensitive training, which are techniques used in classification (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
