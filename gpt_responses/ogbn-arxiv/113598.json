Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and computational linguistics. The paper also utilizes deep learning techniques, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories. The problem of detecting duplicate questions is related to information retrieval (IR), making cs.IR a possible sub-category. Finally, the use of contextualized word representations and fine-grained similarity layer suggests the involvement of neural networks, which makes cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
