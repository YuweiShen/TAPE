The paper also focuses on learning feature representations using deep neural networks (cs.LG) and proposes a novel cross-modality learning framework (cs.AI). The use of multimodal data (RGB and thermal) also suggests a potential fit for multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
