The investigation of data complexity and the identification of complexity classes suggests a connection to computational complexity theory (cs.CC) and the use of rewritings to first-order logic and its extensions suggests a connection to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
