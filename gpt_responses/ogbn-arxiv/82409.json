It may also belong to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category as it proposes a method to improve the efficiency of these algorithms. Additionally, it may be relevant to the optimization and control (cs.DC) sub-category as it discusses optimization techniques. The paper also mentions the use of a separation oracle, which is commonly used in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and operations research (cs.OH), making these sub-categories likely as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
