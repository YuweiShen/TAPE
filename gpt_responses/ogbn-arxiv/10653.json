This falls under the scope of information theory (cs.IT) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the practical benefits of the proposed code construction, such as repairability and transferability, which are relevant to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SI). Finally, the paper involves the use of graph-based techniques and optimization algorithms, which are common in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
