The proposed method involves computing trajectories that respect input- and state-constraints, which is a typical problem in control systems (cs.SY). The approach also involves checking for collisions and inserting viastates, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper evaluates the computational demands of the proposed method, which is a topic that falls under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
