The use of a rotation matrix and hyperplanes in the new feature space indicates that it could be related to machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the proposed method on public benchmark datasets also suggests that it could be related to data structures (cs.DS) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
