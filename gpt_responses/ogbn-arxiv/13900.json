The paper proposes an iterative primal-dual relaxation approach for solving AGP instances to optimality, which involves cutting planes for eliminating fractional solutions. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of algorithms for solving geometric problems, including problems related to polygons, visibility, and guarding. The Art Gallery Problem is a well-known problem in computational geometry, and the paper proposes a new approach for solving it, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in this sub-field. \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures for solving computational problems.
