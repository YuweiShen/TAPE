The paper also proposes a new technique for pooling convolutional layer activations, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on four visual classification tasks, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
