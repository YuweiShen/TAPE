The proposed approach is based on deep learning (cs.LG) and involves the estimation of multiple scene attributes, which requires a certain level of intelligence (cs.AI). The approach is also applicable to robotics (cs.RO) since it can be used to estimate the lighting conditions of an indoor scene, which is important for robot navigation and manipulation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
