The use of principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of support vector machines (SVM) as a classifier, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of wavelet transforms and higher-frequency content of the signal suggests the paper may also be relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
