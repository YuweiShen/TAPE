This technique can be seen as a data structure optimization. \n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the complexity of ML decoding for LDPC codes and proposes a technique to reduce it. This topic is closely related to computational complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
