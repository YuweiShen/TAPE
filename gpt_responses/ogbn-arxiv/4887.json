This involves processing large amounts of data to extract a low-dimensional temporal signal for each node, which is then used to identify performance anomalies. This work involves aspects of distributed computing (cs.DC), machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.NE), and system monitoring (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
