The attack uses classical tools such as vectorial correlation, weight 4 multiples, and Walsh transform, which are commonly used in information theory (cs.IT) and coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also mentions the filtering function having good autocorrelation, which is a concept in signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the attack involves analyzing the structure of the system, which is a common approach in the field of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
