This makes cs.IT (Information Theory) a likely sub-category, as it deals with the efficient transmission and processing of information. The paper also involves the use of matrices and vectors, which suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as another possible sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes composite cyclotomic Fourier transforms (CCFTs) that are advantageous for hardware implementations, which could fall under cs.SI (Signal Processing) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper involves mathematical optimization and complexity analysis, which could also make cs.LG (Machine Learning) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
