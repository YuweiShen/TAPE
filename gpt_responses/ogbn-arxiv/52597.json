The paper also proposes a novel attention-based semi-supervised learning framework, which suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses multi-modal medical imaging data, which could place it in the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a method to weaken the influence of noisy labels, which could suggest that it belongs to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
