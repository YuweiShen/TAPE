Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.MM (Multimedia), which deals with the processing, analysis, and retrieval of multimedia data. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques for keyphrase extraction, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another likely sub-category. The use of semantic word embeddings for textual representation suggests cs.CL (Computation and Language) as another possible sub-category. The paper also involves OCR techniques for video annotation, which falls under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed approach involves a user study, which suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) as another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
