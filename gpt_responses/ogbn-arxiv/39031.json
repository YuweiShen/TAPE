The applications mentioned in the abstract, such as secret sharing and authentication codes, are also related to cryptography (cs.CR). The use of Weil sums suggests a connection to algebraic geometry and number theory, which are topics in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The study of weight distributions is a common theme in coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the mention of strongly regular graphs suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
