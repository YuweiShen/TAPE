This involves numerical analysis techniques for evaluating operators in a matrix-free way and temporal discretization using low-storage explicit Runge-Kutta schemes and the arbitrary derivative (ADER) method. \n2. cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper proposes optimizations for the ADER method, including a flexible basis change approach and degree reduction for optimized cell evaluation. These optimizations can be implemented in software for numerical simulations of wave propagation. \n3. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper's focus on wave propagation simulations has applications in computational engineering and science, such as modeling seismic waves or ocean waves. \n4. cs.SC (Scientific Computing): The paper's use of numerical methods and simulations for wave propagation falls under the scope of scientific computing. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This category is less likely, but the paper's title could potentially be interpreted as referring to waves in the context of social or information networks. However, the abstract and content of the paper make it clear that the focus is on wave propagation simulations using numerical methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
