The use of first order logic and theorem proving tools suggests that the paper may also belong to the logic in computer science (cs.LO) category. The focus on RBAC and its flexibility suggests that the paper may also belong to the software engineering (cs.SE) category. The use of policies and constraints for restricting access to records suggests that the paper may also belong to the databases (cs.DB) category. Finally, the use of Prover9, a general purpose theorem prover tool, suggests that the paper may also belong to the programming languages (cs.PL) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
