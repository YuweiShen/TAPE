The proposed system uses a monocular-based technique for trail detection and tracking, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.AI) algorithms. The system also incorporates Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), which is a popular technique in robotics and computer vision (cs.LG). Finally, the system is designed to perform missions in challenging environments, which involves control and decision-making (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
