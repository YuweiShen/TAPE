This falls under the scope of numerical analysis. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper introduces a new computational primitive, pMMF, which can be used for compressing matrices. This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): MMF is a method for finding multiscale structure and defining wavelets on graphs/matrices, which can be used for machine learning tasks such as clustering and dimensionality reduction. \n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with matrix factorization, which involves linear algebra and discrete mathematics. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): MMF can be used for analyzing and modeling social and information networks, which falls under the scope of this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
