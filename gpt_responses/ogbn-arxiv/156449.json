The use of recovery techniques for low-dimensional sets and the connection to sparse recovery and compressed sensing suggest that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. The focus on convergence speed and reconstruction accuracy suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) and Signal Processing (cs.SP) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
