The method involves measure-aware feature reuse and measure-aware layer growth mechanisms to handle the challenges of model complexity and optimizing performance measures. This work is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
