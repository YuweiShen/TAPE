The paper focuses on reducing the discontinuities caused by the GFDM transmitter filter and achieving promising sidelobe suppression gain. This involves signal processing techniques and optimization of the basis signals used in the GFDM transmitter waveform. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communications and Networking). The paper also involves theoretical analysis and simulation results, which suggest that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes in terms of signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and bit error rate (BER). This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
