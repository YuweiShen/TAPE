This involves studying the emergence of norms and cooperation in the presence of norms. The paper also mentions the use of matrix-games and policy gradients. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (artificial intelligence), cs.GT (game theory), and cs.SI (social and information networks). Additionally, the paper also involves machine learning techniques, which could fall under cs.LG (machine learning) and the study of social norms, which could fall under cs.SOC (social and information networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
