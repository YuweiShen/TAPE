Additionally, the framework is inspired by programming language semantics, which could also place it in the categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) or Programming Languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses inference in Bayesian networks, which could relate to the categories of Software Engineering (cs.SE) or Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
