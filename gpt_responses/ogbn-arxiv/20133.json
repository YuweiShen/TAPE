It also discusses active learning approaches to minimize the number of labels crowdsourced from annotators. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the problem of training an accurate linear regression model by procuring labels from multiple noisy crowd annotators, and proposes a Bayesian model and active learning approach to address this problem. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the use of the multi-armed bandit framework for annotator selection in active learning, which is a well-studied problem in data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the scenario where annotators are strategic and designs suitable incentives to induce them to put in their best efforts, which is a topic related to social and information networks. \n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the problem of procuring labels from multiple noisy crowd annotators, which is a topic related to human-computer interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
