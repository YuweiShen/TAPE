The paper also discusses the use of nonnegative least squares and the absence of l1-regularization, which are common techniques in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper's motivation for wireless network activity detection suggests a possible connection to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. Finally, the paper's novel result on the robust nullspace property of random 0/1-matrices may also be relevant to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
