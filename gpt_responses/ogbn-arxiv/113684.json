It also involves language-theoretic concepts, such as LTL/LTLf goals, which are related to formal languages and automata theory (cs.LO). The paper also discusses reductions and algorithms for solving planning problems, which are topics in programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). The lower bound proof for goal-complexity involves analyzing the structure of the problem, which is related to data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the behavior of fairness notions in planning, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
