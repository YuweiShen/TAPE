This makes it relevant to several sub-categories of computer science. The most likely category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) since the paper deals with logical systems and their properties. The second likely category is cs.PL (Programming Languages) since the paper discusses different resolution strategies in Horn clause logic. The third likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) since the paper deals with the semantics of Horn formulas and their proof terms. The fourth likely category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) since Horn clause logic is widely used in AI applications. The fifth likely category is cs.SE (Software Engineering) since the paper discusses the productivity of different resolution strategies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
