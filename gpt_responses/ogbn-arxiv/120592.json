The paper also analyzes the impact of quantization on the performance of the system, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI) and networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of multiple antennas in the system, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
