The primary focus is on making visualization accessible to all analysts, which suggests a human-computer interaction (HCI) perspective and thus the most likely category is cs.HC. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques for collecting dataset-visualization pairs from an online platform, which suggests cs.IR as a possible category. Machine learning (ML) is a key component of the approach, which suggests categories such as cs.LG (machine learning) and cs.CL (computational linguistics, which can involve natural language processing techniques used in this paper). Finally, the paper involves working with large datasets, which suggests a possible category of cs.DB (databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
