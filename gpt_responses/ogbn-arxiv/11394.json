It also involves polynomial identity testing, which falls under information theory (cs.IT). The use of hitting sets and the modification of existing constructions suggest a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the relevance to the Geometric Complexity Theory program suggests a connection to scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
