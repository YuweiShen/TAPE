This topic falls under the intersection of several sub-fields of computer science, including natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and signal processing. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers research on NLP and ML. \n\nThe second likely sub-category is cs.SD (Sound), which focuses on research related to audio and speech processing. The third likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which covers research on various ML techniques, including RNNs.
