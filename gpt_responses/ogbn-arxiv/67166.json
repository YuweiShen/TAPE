The paper also discusses the optimization and training of these networks, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of residual networks and their improved performance is related to neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
