It may also belong to the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-category as it discusses strategies for using multiple GPUs to reconstruct large datasets. The paper also presents regularization approaches, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Additionally, the paper discusses the acceleration of reconstruction for time-critical medical applications, which may fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
