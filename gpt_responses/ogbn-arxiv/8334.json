The application of these algorithms to continuous tensor decomposition problems suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV). The use of group actions in the orbit recovery problem suggests a connection to dynamical systems (cs.DS) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the use of tensor networks and spectral methods suggests a connection to systems and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
