The paper also discusses the use of massive MIMO, which is a technique commonly used in information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.MM). The paper proposes a novel twin-timescale perspective for resource allocation, which involves long-term and short-term timescales, making it relevant to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of road-traffic density on the proposed scheme, which is related to computer engineering (cs.CE) and transportation systems (cs.TR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
