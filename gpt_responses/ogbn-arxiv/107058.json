Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes new training objectives for building better sentence encoders, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The evaluation benchmarks and tasks also involve information retrieval and neural networks, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
