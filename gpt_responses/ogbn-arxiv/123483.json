The framework also involves abstractions and test structure, which relates to Software Engineering (cs.SE). The use of distributed infrastructure such as PlanetLab suggests a possible category of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper specifically mentions using the framework to deploy a DHT prototype, which is a common topic in Peer-to-Peer (cs.PL) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
