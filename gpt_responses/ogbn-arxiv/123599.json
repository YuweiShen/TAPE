The paper specifically focuses on regression models, which are commonly used in the subfields of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the effect of incorporating these constraints in decision tree regression, which is a popular inference technique used in many subfields of computer science, including computational engineering (cs.CE) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the computational complexity of the proposed approach, which is relevant to the subfield of computational complexity theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
