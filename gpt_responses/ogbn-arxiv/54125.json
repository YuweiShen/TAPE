Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SI (Signal Processing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control) are likely categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the computational load and storage requirements, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.SP (Speech Processing) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
