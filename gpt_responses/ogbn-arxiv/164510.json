The use of Gaussian mixture models (GMM) is a common technique in machine learning and statistics, which suggests that the paper could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves optimization and signal processing, which could place it in cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.SI (Signal Processing). Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach to hyperspectral unmixing, which could be of interest to researchers in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
