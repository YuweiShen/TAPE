The use of pyramidal processing and warping also suggests that it may be related to image processing and computer graphics (cs.MM). The fact that the model is learnable and uses a cost volume suggests that it may also be related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the application of the model to estimate optical flow in real-world scenarios suggests that it may be related to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
