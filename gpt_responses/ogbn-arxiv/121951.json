The use of reductions from 3-Partition suggests that the paper may also be related to computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The problem of finding a simultaneous embedding of two graphs with restricted crossings is also related to the study of graph theory (cs.DS) and graph drawing algorithms (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
