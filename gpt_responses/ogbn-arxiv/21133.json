The paper discusses incentivizing users to explore different recommendations, which falls under the category of reinforcement learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses optimizing recommendations, which falls under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses maximizing social welfare, which falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI) and game theory (cs.GT).
