This involves computer vision and image processing, which are typically covered under the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also deals with security and threat detection, which are typically covered under the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of CNNs also involves machine learning, which is typically covered under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of novel approaches for dataset augmentation, which is typically covered under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the detection of SMTs in cargo containers, which involves information retrieval and search engines, which are typically covered under the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
