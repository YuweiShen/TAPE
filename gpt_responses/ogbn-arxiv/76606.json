The use of hybrid CPU-GPU machines also suggests that it could belong to the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of multi-level queue structures and tile-based parallelization strategies, which could fall under the sub-categories of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) or modeling and simulation (cs.MS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
