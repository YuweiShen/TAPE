The paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach to construct nested polar codes, which is a novel contribution to the field of information theory. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a neural network architecture consisting of policy and value networks to generate actions based on observed states. This is a machine learning approach to solving the problem of nested polar code construction. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper models the nested polar code construction as a Markov decision process (MDP), which is a common approach in systems and control. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach to solve the problem of nested polar code construction, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes an \"integrated learning\" paradigm that combines reinforcement learning with a genetic algorithm. This is a combination of neural and evolutionary computing approaches."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
