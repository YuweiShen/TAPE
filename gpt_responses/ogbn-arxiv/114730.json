The paper proposes a new uncoordinated frequency shift scheme for detecting such attacks. This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) as it involves channel estimation and signal processing. It also involves security and cryptography (cs.CR) as it deals with detecting malicious attacks. The paper also discusses the impact of the proposed scheme on network infrastructure (cs.NI) and proposes an attack detection algorithm based on source enumeration method (cs.SY). Finally, the paper provides numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, which involves simulations and performance evaluation (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
