The focus on minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes suggests that coding theory (cs.CC) is also relevant. The mention of a key definition inspired by Galois theory suggests that algebraic structures (cs.SI) may be involved. Finally, the use of lower bounds suggests that computational complexity (cs.NA) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
