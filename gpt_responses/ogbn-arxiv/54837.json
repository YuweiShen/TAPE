It also involves the use of a perceptual distance metric, which suggests it could also be categorized under Computer Vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of DCT coefficients, which are commonly used in graphics and image processing, indicating it could also be classified under Graphics (cs.GR). The paper also involves optimization techniques, which could place it under Information Retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper mentions the slow computation of Guetzli, which could suggest it falls under the Measurement (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
