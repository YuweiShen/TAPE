The use of linear spaces and codes suggests a connection to coding theory (cs.DS), while the mention of protocols and complexity hints at theoretical computer science (cs.CC). Finally, the use of polynomials and algebraic techniques may also indicate a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
