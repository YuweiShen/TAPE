The use of maximum distance separable codes (MDS) to store data reliably on unreliable storage nodes suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC) or distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the construction of PIR schemes with low download communication cost may involve coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
