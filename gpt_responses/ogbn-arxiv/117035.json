The paper proposes an ensemble model that combines LSTM and MNB models to identify sentiments in Hindi-English code-mixed data. This work involves deep learning techniques (LSTM) and probabilistic models (MNB) for sentiment analysis, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), information retrieval (cs.IR), and social and information networks (cs.SI). Therefore, these are the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
