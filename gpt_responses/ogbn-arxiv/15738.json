Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which makes cs.DL (Machine Learning) another likely category. The paper also deals with information retrieval (IR) as it aims to extract useful information from document images. The use of mobile devices to capture images makes cs.MM (Multimedia) another possible category. Finally, the paper deals with human-computer interaction (HCI) as it aims to improve the user experience of capturing document images. Therefore, cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) is another possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
