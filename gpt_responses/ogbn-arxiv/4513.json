The algorithm is compared with other widely used optimization algorithms, indicating a focus on optimization and search algorithms. The paper also includes practical engineering design problems, suggesting a potential application in control engineering (cs.SY) and computer-aided design (cs.CE). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
