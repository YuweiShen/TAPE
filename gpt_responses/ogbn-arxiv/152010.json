The use of absent receivers to construct decoding chains with skipped messages suggests a focus on network coding (cs.NI) and graph theory (cs.DS). The paper also considers problems that are not complete-S, which suggests a focus on coding theory (cs.SI) and communication complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
