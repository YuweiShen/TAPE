Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems and their performance, making this category a likely fit. \n2. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper employs greedy user selection for multiuser MIMO transmission, which involves multiple agents (users) interacting with each other. This makes cs.MA a possible category. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with multiuser MIMO transmission, which is a key technology for wireless networks. This makes cs.NI a possible category. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with multiuser MIMO transmission, which involves multiple users interacting with each other. This makes cs.SI a possible category. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with multiuser MIMO transmission, which is a key technology for multimedia applications such as video streaming. This makes cs.MM a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
