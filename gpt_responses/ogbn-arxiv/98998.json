However, the focus on replication and the use of atomic multicast as a central abstraction point towards cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The use of online services and the assessment of performance suggest cs.OS (Operating Systems) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as possible sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
