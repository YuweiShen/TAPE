This problem involves both input and target distributions that are non-stationary, and naive approaches to online adaptation result in catastrophic forgetting, which can lead to controller failures. The paper proposes a novel online learning method that combines the pseudo-rehearsal method with locally weighted projection regression. The paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel online learning method for neural networks, which is a subfield of machine learning. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper deals with the problem of controlling an autonomous vehicle, which falls under the domain of robotics. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the problem of controlling a system (i.e., an autonomous vehicle) using a control law, which falls under the domain of systems and control. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with the problem of adapting a neural network for vehicle dynamics, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper does not explicitly deal with computer vision or pattern recognition, but the problem of controlling an autonomous vehicle may involve processing visual information, which falls"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
