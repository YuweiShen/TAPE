The paper proposes new algorithms and analyzes their guarantees, which is a typical topic in data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the maximization of weakly modular functions, which is a common problem in machine learning, especially in feature selection and subset selection. The paper proposes new algorithms and analyzes their performance, which is a typical topic in machine learning. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses some information-theoretic concepts, such as submodularity and supermodularity ratios, to measure the closeness of weakly modular functions to being modular. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to information theory. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with optimization problems, which is a core topic in artificial intelligence. The paper proposes new algorithms and analyzes their performance, which is a typical topic in artificial intelligence. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the tractability and hardness of weakly modular maximization, which are typical topics in computational complexity theory. The paper shows that weakly modular maximization is fixed-parameter tractable under certain conditions, and that no polynomial-time algorithms can improve the existing approximation guarantees achieved by the"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
