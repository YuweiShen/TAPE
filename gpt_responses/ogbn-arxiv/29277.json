The proposed approach involves defining a new class of patterns called frequent neighborhood patterns, which is a form of graph mining that can be categorized under both data mining (cs.DM) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on real-life datasets, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of social informatics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
