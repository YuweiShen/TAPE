Specifically, the paper proposes a new technique for optimizing loss functions using a parameterization based on Taylor expansions. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also mentions applications in computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY), which are additional sub-categories that could be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
