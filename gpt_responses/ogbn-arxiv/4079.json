The paper discusses the effects of decoding costs on the system and considers various multi-user settings. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of communication systems. Other likely categories include cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), as the paper touches upon various aspects of wireless communication systems, including network architecture, control, multimedia, and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
