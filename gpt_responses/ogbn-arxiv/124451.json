The focus of the paper is on energy harvesting and power splitting techniques, which are often studied in the context of wireless networks and communication systems (cs.NI). The paper also considers optimization problems related to power control and outage probability, which are relevant to control and systems engineering (cs.SY) and mathematical optimization (cs.MA). Finally, the paper mentions the use of relays in the network, which is a common topic in multimedia communication and networking (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
