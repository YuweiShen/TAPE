This involves processing both audio and image data. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SD (Sound), which deals with audio processing. The paper also proposes an architecture for estimating matching score positions directly within entire unprocessed sheet images, which involves computer vision techniques. Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of deep learning methods, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
