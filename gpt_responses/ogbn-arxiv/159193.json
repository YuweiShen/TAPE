The paper also discusses the probability of missed detection for fixed probability of false alarm, which is a common topic in the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) category. The paper also mentions the use of metrics such as relative entropy and variational distance, which are commonly used in the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Signal Processing (cs.SI) categories. Finally, the paper discusses the analysis of probability of existence of a code, which is a topic in the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
