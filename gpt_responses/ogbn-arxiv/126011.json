The paper also discusses hardware implementation of the decoding algorithms, which falls under the category of computer systems and architecture (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of polar codes in communication systems (cs.AR) and control systems (cs.SY), which are both relevant sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the flexibility of the decoding algorithms, which could potentially fall under the category of emerging technologies (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
