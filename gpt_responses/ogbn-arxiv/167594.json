The problem involves submodular functions, which are often studied in the context of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also makes use of optimization techniques and algorithms to find equilibria, which suggests it could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. The problem involves pricing and revenue maximization, which is a common topic in the Economics and Computation (cs.EC) category.
