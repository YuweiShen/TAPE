The paper also discusses the properties of these codes in terms of their distance profiles, which is a topic of interest in the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) and network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents techniques for constructing these codes, which could be relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
