The paper discusses the tradeoff between test power and computation time, which is a common concern in machine learning. The paper also discusses kernel selection for hypothesis testing, which is a topic in machine learning and computer vision. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses the asymptotic normality of the null distribution, which is a topic in statistics, suggesting cs.ST (Statistics) as a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the computational efficiency of the proposed tests, which is a topic in information theory, suggesting cs.IT (Information Theory) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
