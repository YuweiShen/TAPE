This topic is closely related to several sub-categories in computer science, including networked systems (cs.NI), information theory (cs.IT), multimedia (cs.MM), systems and control (cs.SY), and cryptography and security (cs.CR). However, given the focus on wireless communication and self-interference mitigation techniques, cs.NI is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.IT and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
