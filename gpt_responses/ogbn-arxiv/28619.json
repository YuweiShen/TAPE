The use of order statistics is a novel approach to this problem, and is likely to be of interest to researchers in the areas of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
