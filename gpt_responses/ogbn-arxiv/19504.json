Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM), Computational Geometry (cs.CG), Graph Theory (cs.GT), and Symbolic Computation (cs.SC) categories. Additionally, since the paper focuses on the NP-hardness of the problem, it may also belong to the Complexity Theory (cs.CC) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
