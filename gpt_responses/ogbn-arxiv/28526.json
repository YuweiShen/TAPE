The paper proposes a new database and benchmark for facial pose analysis, which involves face frontalization, face rotation, facial pose estimation, and pose-invariant face recognition. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also uses deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could belong to cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper proposes a new parsing guided discriminator, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves face recognition, which could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
