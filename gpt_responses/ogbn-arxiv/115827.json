The focus on reliability and trustworthiness suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer engineering (cs.CE). The discussion of expert knowledge and human-computer interaction suggests a connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The emphasis on validation and robustness analysis suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the discussion of the nature of computer data suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
