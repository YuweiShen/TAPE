The paper specifically focuses on weighted problems and introduces a new function type called linearizable functions. The problems studied in the paper are related to graph partitioning, network design, facility location, scheduling, vehicle routing, and computational social choice, which are all topics that fall under various sub-categories of computer science. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
