The paper also discusses the trade-off between accuracy and speed, which is a common concern in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method is designed for urban street scenes, which suggests that it may be relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
