The paper also discusses the implementation of the type system, which could potentially place it under the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The use of lambda calculus and type theory suggests that it could also fall under the Theoretical Computer Science (cs.TL) sub-category. The paper discusses the use of intersection and union types for encoding language features, which could place it under the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of unrestricted intersections and unions for simulating dynamic typing, which could potentially place it under the Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
