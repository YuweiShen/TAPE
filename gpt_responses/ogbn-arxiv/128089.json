Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The use of word embeddings and machine learning techniques to analyze the data suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the focus on understanding the dynamics of a target word and identifying historical turning points could also place this paper in the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
