The proposed method involves incorporating attention learning as additional objectives in a ReID network, which falls under the category of deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of keypoints to increase robustness to pose variation and partial occlusion, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its performance on five widely used datasets, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
