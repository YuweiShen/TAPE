The proposed solution involves optimization problems and statistical learning models, which are commonly used in database research. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel explanation mechanism for exploratory analytics, which involves statistical learning models and optimization problems. These are common techniques used in AI research. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a statistical learning model to acquire parametric piecewise-linear functions for explaining aggregate queries. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper addresses the issue of limited information conveyed by aggregate query results and proposes a solution for explaining aggregates to aid exploratory analytics. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a solution for efficiently computing explanations for future aggregate queries without accessing the database. This involves designing efficient algorithms and data structures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
