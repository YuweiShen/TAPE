The paper deals with video question answering using recurrent neural networks and explores approaches for finer understanding of video content. This falls under the intersection of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the use of neural networks for learning temporal structures and predicting future events aligns with artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of video data falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
