The concept of labeling schemes with queries involves the use of additional vertices to infer the value of a function, which could be seen as a graph-theoretic problem (cs.CG) or an information theory problem (cs.IT). Finally, the paper proposes a technique to reduce label size, which could be of interest to researchers in the field of space-efficient data structures (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
