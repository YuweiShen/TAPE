It also introduces a new type of functions called biregular irreducible (BRI) functions, which are similar to universal hash functions, and shows their application in achieving semantic security. This involves concepts from cryptography (cs.CR) and coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the construction of BRI functions from families of Ramanujan graphs, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DS) and graph theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
