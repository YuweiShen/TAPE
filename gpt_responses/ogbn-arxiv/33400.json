The use of linguistic cues and joint inference over all phrases in a caption suggests that this paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of automatic weight learning and the combination of multiple cues suggests that this paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories.
