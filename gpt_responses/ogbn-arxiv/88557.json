The paper discusses the application of Information Retrieval (IR) and Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning to text data, which are common topics in the sub-categories of Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), and Machine Learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DL). However, since the paper focuses on the use of big neural networks, which is a common technique in Deep Learning (cs.DL), this sub-category is also likely to be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
