The paper also discusses the use of distance functions and optimization algorithms, which are relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper provides a proof-of-concept with distance measures for permutations, which is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
