Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves the use of random variables and Gaussian noise, which are common in communication systems, making cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) another likely sub-category. The use of decision feedback equalizers (DFE) and single-dimensional integrations suggests a possible fit with cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SI (Signal Processing), respectively. Finally, the paper involves the analysis of lower bounds, which could be related to cs.MM (Mathematical Methods)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
