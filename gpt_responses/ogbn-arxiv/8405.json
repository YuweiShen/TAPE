The paper uses transfer learning to overcome the challenge of a small training dataset. The paper also introduces a novel technique for detecting anomalies in medical images. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) in the development of the classifier."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
