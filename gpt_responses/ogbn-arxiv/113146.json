Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new method for combining features from each side output, which involves designing a more efficient and effective way to pass back global information. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.AI (artificial intelligence) and cs.LG (machine learning). Additionally, the paper involves training on large-scale object images, which could be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.IR (information retrieval) and cs.MM (multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
