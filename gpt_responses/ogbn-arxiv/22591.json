This topic falls under the category of computational social science (cs.CY) as it involves the study of social phenomena using computational methods. The paper also discusses the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in analyzing the performance of non-expert crowds. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of human-computer interaction (cs.HC) in designing interfaces for crowdsourcing. Finally, the paper discusses the use of data science (cs.SD) and machine learning (cs.SI) in analyzing the data collected from crowdsourcing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
