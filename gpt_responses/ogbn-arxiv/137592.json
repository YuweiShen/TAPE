The paper also mentions the challenge of encoding symbolic knowledge into connectionist systems, which falls under the category of natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the current state-of-the-art research, which may fall under software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
