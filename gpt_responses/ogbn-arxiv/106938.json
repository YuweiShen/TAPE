This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper aims to gain a holistic understanding of how human beings interact with vehicle automation technology, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) aspects. The paper also mentions the challenges associated with autonomous vehicle development, which suggests that it may belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Furthermore, the paper mentions the use of deep learning-based internal and external perception systems, which suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper aims to identify how technology and other factors related to automation adoption and use can be improved in ways that save lives, which suggests that it may belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
