The paper also discusses the simulation of probabilistic and quantum automata using affine automata, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) or data structures (cs.DS). The study on the succintness of affine automata could also be related to logic in computer science (cs.LO) or emerging technologies (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
