The mention of the decay of citing rates and the similarity to ultradiffusional processes suggests a connection to social networks, which could fall under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI). The mention of the distribution of papers per author being similar to the distribution of posts per user in social networks could also suggest a connection to the sub-category of social computing (cs.SD). Finally, the mention of the rate of uncited papers growing while some papers go viral in terms of being cited could suggest a connection to the sub-category of cybernetics (cs.CY), which deals with the study of communication and control processes in complex systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
