It addresses the problem from an information theoretic set-up and provides algorithm independent conditions for reliable reconstruction of sparse signals. The paper also considers the effect of correlation and sensing diversity on sensing capacity. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
