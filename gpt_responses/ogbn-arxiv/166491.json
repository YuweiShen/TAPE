It also involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a new method to enhance the semantic representation ability of ZSL models. Additionally, it involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it aims to recognize unseen objects using disjoint seen objects via sharing attributes. It also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it deals with attributes that transfer semantic information. Finally, it involves multimedia (cs.MM) as it uses benchmark datasets and the ImageNet dataset to evaluate the proposed method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
