Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also uses reinforcement learning (RL) to generate the distractors, which falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), making cs.AI a likely sub-category as well. The paper evaluates the effectiveness of the generated distractors on well-trained VQA models, which involves evaluating the performance of these models, making cs.LG a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with generating textual distractors, which involves information retrieval (IR) techniques, making cs.IR a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
