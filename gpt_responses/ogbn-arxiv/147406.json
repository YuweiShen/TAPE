The use of basis analysis and linear transformations also suggests a connection to this field.\n2. cs.SP (Signal Processing): The paper explicitly mentions signal reconstruction and compressive sensing, which are both topics within signal processing. The application of the proposed framework to optical modal analysis of spatial beams also suggests a connection to this field.\n3. cs.Optics (Optics): The paper specifically mentions the application of the proposed framework to optical modal analysis, which is a topic within optics. \n4. cs.SI (Systems and Control): The use of a sensing structure and the analysis of its degrees of freedom suggest a connection to systems and control. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): While not a primary focus of the paper, the use of interferometry and signal reconstruction could potentially have applications in multimedia, such as in image or video processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
