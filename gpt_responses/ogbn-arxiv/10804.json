The proposed approach involves designing an end-to-end network and using saliency-guided localization learning, which are both related to machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also evaluates its approach on a widely-used dataset, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
