The paper evaluates how effectively crowd-sourced and expert-annotated graphs can represent the multimodal structure of diagrams for representation learning using various graph neural networks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, since the paper involves image analysis and computer vision techniques, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also involves AI techniques, so cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another possible sub-category. Finally, since the paper involves information retrieval techniques to classify diagrams and their parts, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
