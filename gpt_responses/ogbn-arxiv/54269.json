Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a self-supervised learning approach, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper uses pre-training tasks and fine-tuning, which are common techniques in deep learning (cs.AI). The paper also deals with large-scale data processing, which could fall under cs.SD (Software Engineering) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
