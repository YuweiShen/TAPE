It also involves deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The paper discusses the use of SoftMax loss, which is commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) tasks, but in the context of image classification. Finally, the experiments involve benchmark fine-grained data sets, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
