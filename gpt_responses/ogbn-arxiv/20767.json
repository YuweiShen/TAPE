The paper also develops a new upper bound on the sum-rate, which is a key concept in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with a multiple access channel, which is a key concept in networking and internet architecture. The paper also discusses the impact of feedback on the capacity of the channel, which is a relevant topic in networking. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper discusses the use of compute and forward and decode and forward techniques, which are commonly used in social and information networks. The paper also discusses the impact of feedback on the capacity of the channel, which is relevant in social and information networks. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses a coding scheme based on compute and forward and decode and forward techniques, which are algorithms commonly used in data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper briefly discusses the case of lossy reconstruction of the modulo-sum, which is a relevant topic in cryptography and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
