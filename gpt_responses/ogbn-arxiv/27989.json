Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.SC (Symbolic Computation). Additionally, the paper uses techniques from information theory (specifically, Koszul Young flattenings), which suggests a possible fit with cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
