The paper proposes a system that integrates deep learning-based detection with prior maps to recognize the relevant traffic lights of predefined routes. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also deals with the problem of autonomous driving, which falls under the category of cs.RO (Robotics). The use of deep learning techniques also suggests the category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper proposes a new technique for traffic light recognition, which can be considered as a contribution to the field of machine learning, and hence, the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also likely. Finally, the paper deals with the problem of security in autonomous driving, which can be considered as a sub-topic of the category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
