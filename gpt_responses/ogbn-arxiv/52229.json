The paper also discusses the use of trusted hardware and software to support regulation compliant behavior, which could fall under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also mentions the use of network function virtualization (NFV), which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the possibility of controlling the duty cycles of node radios to increase energy efficiency, which could fall under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in three relevant scenarios, which could fall under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
