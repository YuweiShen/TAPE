Therefore, cs.AI and cs.RO are the most likely categories. The paper also extends the STRIPS planning language, which falls under the category of planning and scheduling (cs.PL). The paper also discusses cost-sensitive planning, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with declarative specifications and blackbox samplers, which are related to symbolic reasoning and knowledge representation (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
