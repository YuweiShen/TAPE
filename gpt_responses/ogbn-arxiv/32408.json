The use of LSTM and preactivations also suggests a connection to neural networks (cs.NE) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper mentions the interpretability of the resulting structure, which could be relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
