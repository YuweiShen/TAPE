The paper also proposes a novel way to pose connectivity constraints inspired by network flow problems, which is a common topic in robotics (cs.RO). The paper also deals with clustering methods to separate a large exploration problem into smaller problems, which is a common topic in networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes an integer linear program for synthesizing information-consistent plans, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
