The paper also involves the use of photon-counting receivers, which is related to physical-layer communication (cs.PHY). Additionally, the paper discusses optimization problems and mathematical methods for finding the capacity, which falls under the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
