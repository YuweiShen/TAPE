The paper proposes a novel method for combining multiple graphs into a global graph using mask matrices, which is a technique commonly used in graph-based machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
