The problem studied in the paper involves scheduling orders to minimize costs, which is a common problem in the field of algorithms and complexity (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the integrality gap of a linear-program relaxation, which is a topic in the field of information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper uses computer-assisted methods to obtain stronger lower bounds, which is a topic in the field of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper presents approximation algorithms, which is a topic in the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
