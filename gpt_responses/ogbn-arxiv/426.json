Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of data compression and communication. The paper also involves signal processing techniques for feature extraction, which suggests cs.SP (Signal Processing) as another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses hardware design aspects, which could fall under cs.ET (Embedded Systems). Additionally, the paper involves simulations and measurement results, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
