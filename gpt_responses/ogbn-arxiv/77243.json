The paper also talks about the placement and delivery phase, which involves data structures (cs.DS). The use of bipartite graphs is a common tool in network optimization (cs.NI) and the paper discusses the strong edge coloring of bipartite graphs. The paper also mentions the load of networks during peak-traffic times, which is a topic in system and network optimization (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the construction of placement delivery arrays, which involves graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
