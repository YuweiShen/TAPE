The use of maximal rank-distance (MRD) codes is a key component of the constructions, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CR). The paper also involves combinatorial designs and counting codewords, which are topics in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The constructions involve lifting MRD codes in several blocks, which is a topic in algebraic coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the constructed codes in terms of error correction and decoding, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
