The paper also involves the use of techniques from information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG) to adapt the Sieve-Streaming algorithm. Finally, the paper presents a new approximation algorithm, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
