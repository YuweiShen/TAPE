The paper also discusses the empirical performance of the approach, which suggests that it could be relevant to \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI) and \"Computer Vision\" (cs.CV) sub-categories. The paper also presents theoretical results on the capacity of linear hulls and generalization bounds, which could be relevant to \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS) and \"Systems and Control\" (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
