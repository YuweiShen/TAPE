The use of deep learning algorithms also suggests that it could fall under machine learning (cs.MM) and learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The evaluation of human recognition rates and the use of Mechanical Turk suggests that it could also fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the study of algorithm robustness and potential vulnerabilities could also fall under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
