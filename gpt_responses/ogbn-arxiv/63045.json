The paper focuses on safety games with infinitely many vertices, but the framework is also applicable to safety games over finite graphs. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning framework for synthesizing reactive controllers, which suggests that it belongs to the Machine Learning sub-category. \n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper deals with two-player games over (potentially) infinite graphs, which suggests that it belongs to the Game Theory sub-category. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a framework for synthesizing reactive controllers, which suggests that it belongs to the Systems and Control sub-category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a machine learning framework for synthesizing reactive controllers, which suggests that it belongs to the Artificial Intelligence sub-category. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper proposes a decision tree learning algorithm for synthesizing reactive controllers, which suggests that it belongs to the Programming Languages sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
