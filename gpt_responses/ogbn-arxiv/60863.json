The paper focuses on modeling human and robot control policies as separate neural networks and training them via TRPO. The paper also presents a method for modeling human dressing behavior under variations in capability. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is Robotics (cs.RO), followed by Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
