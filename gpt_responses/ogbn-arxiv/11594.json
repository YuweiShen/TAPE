The paper proposes a novel accelerator for training GCNs, which is relevant to this sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): GCNs are a type of neural network and the paper proposes optimizations for training them. This is directly relevant to the sub-category of machine learning.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a hardware pipeline for training GCNs on CPU-FPGA heterogeneous systems, which involves system-level design and optimization. This is relevant to the sub-category of systems and control.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a systolic array based design for efficient parallelization of weight updates in GCN layers. This is relevant to the sub-category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
