The problem of maximum inner product search is commonly studied in information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (LG) communities. The paper also mentions the use of quantization techniques, which are commonly used in computer vision (CV) and data structures (DS) research. Finally, the experiments conducted in the paper involve text and image datasets, which are commonly used in natural language processing (CL) and computer vision (CV) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
