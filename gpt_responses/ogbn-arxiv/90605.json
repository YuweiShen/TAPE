The dataset is specifically designed to capture adverse effects in violent settings, which could also fall under the sub-category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of deep learning models and large-scale datasets suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the mention of low resolution and high blur could also suggest relevance to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
