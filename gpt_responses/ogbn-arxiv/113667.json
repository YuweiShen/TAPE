This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the optimization of signal-to-interference-ratio, which is a common problem in control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of single-antenna communication nodes, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for optimizing network performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
