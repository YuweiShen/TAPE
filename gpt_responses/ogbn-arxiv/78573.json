Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). However, the paper also discusses the physical layer limitations in terms of spectrum resources and radio access channel connectivity, which falls under the category of cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper addresses the need for improved security, which is related to cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses the need for cloud services and edge-cloud, which falls under the category of cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science). Finally, the paper mentions the use of IoTs for smart vehicles, which is related to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
