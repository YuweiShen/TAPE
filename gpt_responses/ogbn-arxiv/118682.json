This approach is based on computer vision and machine learning techniques, which are typically covered in the arXiv sub-categories of computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and multimedia (cs.MM). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
