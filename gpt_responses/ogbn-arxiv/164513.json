This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The study also evaluates the efficacy of different deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the potential clinical applications of the findings, which falls under the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
