This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper mentions the use of metal-oxide sensors, which are commonly used in neural networks and artificial intelligence applications. This suggests a possible connection to neural and evolutionary computing.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the system model for the tabletop molecular communication platform, which involves both propagation and sensor detection. This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n4. cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper discusses a relatively new technology, molecular communication systems, which is still in the emerging stage. This suggests a possible connection to emerging technologies.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper mentions the use of experimental data to estimate coefficients in the derived models. This could involve the use of multimedia techniques for data collection and analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
