The use of reinforcement learning algorithms such as tabular-Q, LA-Q, and DQN suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of cooperative multi-agent learning (CMA-DQN) suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the optimization of radio resource allocation suggests a focus on information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
