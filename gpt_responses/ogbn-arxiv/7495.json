Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves the use of 3D point data, which suggests that it may also fall under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques, which suggests that it may also fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence).
