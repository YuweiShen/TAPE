The paper discusses the $\\sigma$-self-orthogonality of these codes, which involves the use of ring automorphisms. This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also involves algebraic structures and their properties, which could fall under the categories of discrete structures (cs.DS) and symbolic computation (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with specific types of codes, namely constacyclic codes, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
