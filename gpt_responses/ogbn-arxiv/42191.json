The paper also establishes a connection between nested words and the free bisemigroup, and applies the results to obtain characterizations of algebraic formal power series. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL), Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Information Theory (cs.IT), and Symbolic Computation (cs.SC) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
