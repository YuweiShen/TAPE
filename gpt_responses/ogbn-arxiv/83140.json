Therefore, cs.HCI and cs.CL are the most likely categories. The paper also discusses the use of deep learning models, which falls under cs.AI and cs.CV. Finally, the paper focuses on document summarization, which is a task related to information retrieval (IR), making cs.IR a likely category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
