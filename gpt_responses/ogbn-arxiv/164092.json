The addition of duples and their impact on self-assembly systems is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC) and theoretical computer science (cs.TC). The discussion of Turing universal computation and the efficient self-assembly of shapes also falls under these categories. The use of duples in laboratory implementations of DNA-based tiles relates to the field of graph theory (cs.GT) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
