This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves modeling user behavior and purchase patterns, which suggests that it could also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories.
