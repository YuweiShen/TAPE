The focus of the paper is on impossibility proofs for convergence of mobile robots with Byzantine failures. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO), Robotics (cs.RO), Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), and Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
