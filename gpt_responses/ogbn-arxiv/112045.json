The paper focuses on security and privacy concerns, which are typically addressed in the computer security (cs.CR) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the integration of the protocols into an existing open-source distributed applications framework, which falls under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the privacy limitations of the Apple AirDrop protocol, which is a peer-to-peer file sharing mechanism, and proposes a solution to improve its privacy, which falls under the distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and software engineering (cs.SE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
