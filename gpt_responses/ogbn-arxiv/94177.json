It also involves the use of Gaussian distributions, which is a common topic in machine learning and computer vision (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the use of helpers and the optimization of decoding strategies, which are topics in distributed systems (cs.SI and cs.DS). Finally, the paper provides explicit characterizations for the rate-distortion regions, which is a topic in optimization and mathematical modeling (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
