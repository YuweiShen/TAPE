This makes it likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Robotics (cs.RO) categories. The approach also involves the use of lazy clause generation, which is a technique used in constraint programming and satisfiability solving, making the paper relevant to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.PL) category. Additionally, the paper involves experiments and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, indicating a focus on empirical evaluation, which is relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
