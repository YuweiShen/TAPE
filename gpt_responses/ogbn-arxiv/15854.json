The use of deep learning techniques also suggests a possible fit with the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves optimization and probabilistic analysis, which could place it in the sub-categories of cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the use of deep learning for CSI estimation also suggests a possible fit with the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
