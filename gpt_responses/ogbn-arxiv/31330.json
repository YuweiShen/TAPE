The focus on local algorithms and the use of Markov chains suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of stochastic processes and their applications (cs.SI). Finally, the use of graph cuts and conductance suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
