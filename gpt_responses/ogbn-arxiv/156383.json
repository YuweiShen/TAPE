The use of machine learning approaches to model link-scheduling decisions suggests a connection to artificial intelligence. The paper also discusses the characterization of residual interference as a random loss variable, which is related to information theory. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
