The paper also proposes an image-space observer and an adaptive controller, which involve computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY) techniques. The use of adaptive control and observer-based techniques suggests that the paper may also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
