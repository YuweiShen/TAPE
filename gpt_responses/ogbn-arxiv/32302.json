The annotations include demarcations of text spans that describe the Patient population enrolled, the Interventions studied and to what they were Compared, and the Outcomes measured. These spans are further annotated at a more granular level, e.g., individual interventions within them are marked and mapped onto a structured medical vocabulary. This work involves natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as named entity recognition, relation extraction, and text classification, which are commonly studied in the arXiv CS sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the use of diverse workers with varying levels of expertise and cost suggests the involvement of crowdsourcing and human computation, which are studied in the arXiv CS sub-categories of cybernetics (cs.CY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
