The paper focuses on training large scale convolutional neural networks such as VGGNet and ResNet in a distributed manner using web browsers as the client. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning) followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the paper deals with training convolutional neural networks. The paper also mentions the use of GPGPU from WebCL framework, which suggests that it may belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) as well. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of natural language processing, which suggests that it may belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.MM (Multimedia) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
