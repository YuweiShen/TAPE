The paper also focuses on scaling up GNNs to large graphs, which involves computational and data structure challenges that are often studied in the data structures (cs.DS) and social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a new method for accelerating GNNs that is based on node sampling, which is a common technique in the field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
