The focus is on the manipulation task, where the robot adjusts its pose with respect to obstacles and target objects through RGBD data and updates information related to the last steps of the manipulation process using contact sensors. This work involves robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV) as the primary areas of research. Additionally, the use of machine learning and optimization techniques for improving the performance of the system suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the system's evaluation and comparison with baselines suggest the involvement of systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
