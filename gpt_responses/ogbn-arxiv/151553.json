This involves using neural networks as function approximators and enforcing small residual error on pre-defined parts of the state-space. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG), Robotics (cs.RO), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Software Engineering (cs.SD) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
