The paper also proposes a new formulation for learning a robust ZSL model, which involves optimization and machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the vulnerability of ZSL models to adversarial attacks, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on image datasets, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
