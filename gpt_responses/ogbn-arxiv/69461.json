This involves combining both convolutional and prior spatial features for improving segmentation accuracy. The paper also proposes a restricted sample selection strategy to force the network to learn the most difficult parts of the structures. Given these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
