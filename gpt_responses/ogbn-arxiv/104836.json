This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also mentions real-world host signals with memory, such as images, audio, or video, which suggests that it may be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the trade-off between embedding rate and distortion, which is a common problem in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
