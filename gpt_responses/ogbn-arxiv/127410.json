The proposed method involves attention-guided localization learning and an end-to-end discriminative localization network, which are both related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates its approach on two widely used fine-grained image classification datasets, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
