The paper also includes experiments in computing molecular conformations, which suggests a connection to computational chemistry. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), followed by cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DS (Dynamical Systems), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
