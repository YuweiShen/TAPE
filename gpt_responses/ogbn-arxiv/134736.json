This makes computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) the most likely categories. Information retrieval (cs.IR) is also relevant as the paper discusses the challenges of transferring models from multimedia images to hyperspectral data. Artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) are also relevant as the paper focuses on deep learning approaches for classification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
