The proposed solution involves taking into account contextual information of both services and users, which is a characteristic of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). The paper also proposes a hierarchical prediction mechanism, which is a common technique in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Deep Learning (cs.DL). Finally, the paper uses a hybrid filtering method to obtain a set of similar users and services, which is a common technique in Information Retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
