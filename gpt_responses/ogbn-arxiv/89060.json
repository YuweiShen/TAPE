This involves maximizing the number of different states an agent can reliably reach, as measured by the mutual information between the set of options and option termination states. The paper also discusses two policy gradient-based algorithms, one that creates an explicit embedding space of options and one that represents options implicitly. The algorithm scales well with function approximation and is demonstrated on a range of tasks. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
