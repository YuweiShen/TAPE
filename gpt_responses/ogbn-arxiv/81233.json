This involves connecting smaller fundamental models hierarchically while maintaining their programmatic independence. The paper also proposes a method for parameter estimation by communicating minimal parameters between various modules while maintaining their programmatic independence. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a framework for constructing a large-scale cognitive model for robots, which involves connecting smaller models hierarchically and optimizing their parameters. This is a core topic in AI research. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a method for parameter estimation by communicating minimal parameters between various modules while maintaining their programmatic independence. This is a common problem in machine learning, and the proposed method could be of interest to researchers in this field. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper focuses on constructing a large-scale cognitive model for robots to understand their environment through various sensors. This is a core topic in robotics research. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a framework for constructing a large-scale generative model, which involves connecting smaller models hierarchically and optimizing their parameters.
