This topic falls under the sub-category of natural language processing (NLP), which is typically classified under cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves modifying the objective function of neural networks, which is a common technique in machine learning (ML) research. Therefore, it is also likely to be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed methods in both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, which are common in information retrieval (IR) and social media analysis (SI) research. Therefore, it is also possible to be classified under cs.IR and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
