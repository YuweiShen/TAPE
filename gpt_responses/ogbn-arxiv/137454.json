The paper discusses the sharing of information among different tasks in MTDNN and establishes a formal connection between MTDNN and multitask GP. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning) followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
