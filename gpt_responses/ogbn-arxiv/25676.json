The concept of stopping sets is also related to graph theory and combinatorics, which are covered by cs.DS and cs.DM. Finally, the paper presents bounds on stopping redundancy for specific codes and code ensembles, which could be relevant to the design and analysis of error-correcting codes, a topic covered by cs.CC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
