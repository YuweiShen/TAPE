This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The inputs of the agent are plain-text descriptions of states of a game of incomplete information, i.e. real-time large scale online auctions, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR). The agent is based on an asynchronous stochastic variant of DQN (Deep Q Network), which suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with online auctions, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of Game Theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
