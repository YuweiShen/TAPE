The use of advanced methods to improve the quality of NMT systems suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The proposed variant of Byte-Pair Encoding algorithm indicates that it could also be classified under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the focus on a low-resourced language pair and the use of data sparsity reduction techniques suggest that it could also belong to cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
