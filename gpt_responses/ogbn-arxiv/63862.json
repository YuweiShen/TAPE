The use of limited feedback for channel knowledge and quantization techniques suggest a focus on Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) and Systems and Control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of random quantization, which is a common technique in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and the comparison of different feedback schemes, which falls under Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
