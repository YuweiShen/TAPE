The optimization problem of minimizing the delivery rate involves algorithms and optimization techniques (cs.SI). The use of caches and the management of data storage also relate to distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a novel scheme that achieves better performance than existing schemes, which falls under machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
