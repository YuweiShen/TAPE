These applications fall under the sub-categories of Information Theory (cs.IT), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Signal Processing (cs.SI), and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
