The paper studies how the spectrum of equivalences for Labelled Prime Event Structures changes if we consider two simplified notions of event structures: one obtained by removing the causality relation (Coherence Spaces) and the other by removing the conflict relation (Elementary Event Structures). This suggests that the paper could belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category, as it deals with the study of logical systems and their applications in computer science. Additionally, the paper could also belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category, as it deals with the study of programming languages and their semantics. The paper also deals with the study of data structures (cs.DS) and software engineering (cs.SE), which are other likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper could belong to the Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL) sub-category, as it deals with the study of formal languages and their applications in automata theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
