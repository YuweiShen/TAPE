The use of atomic norm relaxation and low-dimensional projections suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.SI (Signal Processing) categories. The focus on optimization and computational complexity also suggests the cs.SP (Signal Processing) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) categories. Finally, the use of theoretical analysis and algorithmic design suggests the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
