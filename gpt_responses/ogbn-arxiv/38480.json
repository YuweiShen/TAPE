The paper also considers temporal correlation and spectral density functions, which are related to signal processing and statistical inference (cs.SI). The study of low-SNR asymptotics is relevant to network information theory (cs.NI) and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
