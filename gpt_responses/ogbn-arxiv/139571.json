The approach proposed in the paper involves incorporating high-level semantics from previously collected datasets, which suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of policy learning also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the ability of the approach to be deployed on real robots, indicating a potential focus on systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
