The paper also discusses a new algorithm for training these detectors, which involves optimizing hyperparameters and heuristics, a topic that falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of complementary advances in the field, which could involve natural language processing (cs.CL) or neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
