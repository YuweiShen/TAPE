The approach involves incorporating human corrections, which could involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV) and machine learning algorithms (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper also mentions joint optimization, which is a common technique in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
