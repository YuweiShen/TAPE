The paper specifically focuses on the problem of mobility-aware optimization of resources, which involves predicting future channel state information (CSI) based on the mobility of users. This suggests that the paper could belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): This sub-category covers research on computer networks, including network protocols, architectures, and applications. The paper's focus on resource allocation in VLC networks fits well within this sub-category. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category covers research on the mathematical foundations of information processing and communication. The paper's use of CSI to dynamically allocate network resources suggests that it could be relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): This sub-category covers research on multimedia systems and applications, including audio, video, and image processing. The paper's focus on VLC, which uses visible light for high-speed wireless communication, suggests that it could be relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category covers research on systems and control theory, including the design and analysis of control systems. The paper's use of a T-step look-ahead policy and handover efficiency to optimize resource allocation suggests that it could be relevant to this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
