This involves the use of contrastive principal component analysis (cPCA) to extract essential features and create a scalable visualization of clusters' feature contributions. The paper's focus on visual analytics and machine learning techniques suggests that it could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories. However, given the emphasis on human-computer interaction and user-centered design, cs.HC is the most likely category. The paper also involves the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, which could place it in cs.AI, cs.LG, or cs.CV. Finally, the paper's use of data analysis and visualization techniques could also place it in cs.IR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
