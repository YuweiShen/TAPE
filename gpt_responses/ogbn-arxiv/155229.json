The use of soft computing techniques for generating task-oriented structures for morphological robots suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.MA) techniques. The focus on self-assembly, self-reconfiguration, self-repair, and self-reproduction of soft robots indicates the involvement of systems and control (cs.SY) techniques. Finally, the assessment of the current state of the art in the field suggests the involvement of neural networks (cs.NE) and other computational techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
