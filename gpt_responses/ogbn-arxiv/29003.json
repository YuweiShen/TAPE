This topic falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and system and control (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the limitations of cryptographic measures due to hardware constraints, which relates to information theory (cs.IT). The proposed method involves analyzing the analog message signal, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses strategies for handling signal changes, which relates to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
