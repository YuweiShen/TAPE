The paper also mentions the use of gradient descent as an initializer, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper proposes a framework to equip swarm-based optimizers with multi-scale search capabilities, which can be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed framework on EEG data, which can be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
