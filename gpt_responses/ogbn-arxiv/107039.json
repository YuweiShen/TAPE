The technique involves syntactic program transformations (cs.PL) and explores fix candidates exhaustively up to a provided bound (cs.AI). The paper also presents a novel mechanism to detect and prune infeasible fix candidates (cs.SY). Finally, the evaluation is performed on a benchmark of faulty Java container classes (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
