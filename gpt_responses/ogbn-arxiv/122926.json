Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses alignment of different KG embedding spaces, which involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The applications mentioned in the abstract, such as question answering and knowledge graph completion, are also relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
