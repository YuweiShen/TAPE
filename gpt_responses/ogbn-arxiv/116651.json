It also addresses issues related to quality of service (QoS) and dynamic control of cloud resources, which are relevant to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) and Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-categories. The paper proposes a modular structure that can be expanded by available computing power, which is related to the Distributed Systems (cs.Distributed) sub-category. Finally, the paper describes the establishment of a pilot cloud for experimentation, which is relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
