Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computational Engineering, Biology and Medicine (cs.CE, cs.BM) sub-categories. The paper also involves the reconstruction of high-resolution three-dimensional geometrical models and the use of imaging techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of numerical methods to obtain accurate estimates of haemodynamics, which suggests that it could belong to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the study of vascular development, which suggests that it could also belong to the Modeling and Simulation (cs.MS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
