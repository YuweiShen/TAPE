The use of laser scanners and dynamic occupancy grid maps (DOGMa) suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. However, the use of deep learning techniques and automatic label generation indicates that it could also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a loss function to counteract the high imbalance between mostly static background and extremely rare dynamic grid cells, which suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the development of an algorithm, which could place it in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the problem of misdetections, which could also place it in the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
