This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of transfer learning and optimization of classification thresholds suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The use of medical images also suggests a potential fit for the medical imaging (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of expert radiologists to label the data suggests a potential fit for the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
