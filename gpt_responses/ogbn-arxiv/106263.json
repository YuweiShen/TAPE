The use of regularization techniques and matrix deviation inequalities also suggests a connection to optimization (cs.OH) and linear algebra (cs.LA). However, since the focus is on sub-Gaussian measurements and structured signals, we can rule out some sub-categories such as cs.CV (computer vision) and cs.CR (cryptography)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
