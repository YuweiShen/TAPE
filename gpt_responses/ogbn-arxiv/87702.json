The paper also discusses the use of feedback mechanisms and an attitude estimator, which could be classified under systems and control (cs.SY). The tuning of the feedback mechanisms involves the use of LQR, which is a common control technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of robot pose representations, which could be related to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the use of model-free and robot-agnostic feedback mechanisms, which could be related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
