Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.LG (Machine Learning), or cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the paper uses proxies to train the few-shot logo recognizer, which could suggest that it belongs to cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
