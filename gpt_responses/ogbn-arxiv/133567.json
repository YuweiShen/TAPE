Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses the adoption of Certificate Transparency (CT) and the tool developed for data collection, visualization, and analysis of the root stores, which falls under the sub-category of cs.SE (Software Engineering). The paper also touches upon the evolving vendor CT policies, which can be categorized under cs.CY (Computers and Society). The analysis of the root stores and their changes can be considered as a sub-topic of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Finally, the survey conducted with the log operators can be classified under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
