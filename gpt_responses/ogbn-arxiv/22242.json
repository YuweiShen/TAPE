The paper specifically focuses on a new formalism called Factored-Observation Games (FOGs), which can be used to model extensive-form games (EFGs) and partially observable stochastic games (POSGs). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.AI, cs.GT, and cs.LG, followed by cs.MA and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
