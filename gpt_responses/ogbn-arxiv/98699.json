The proposed defense method involves preprocessing images using matrix estimation (ME), which is a technique commonly used in signal processing and optimization (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the compatibility of the ME-Net with human perception, which is related to the field of cognitive science (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed method against various types of attacks, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
