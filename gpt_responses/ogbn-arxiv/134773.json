Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves sketching techniques, which are often used in data structures and algorithms, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) another likely sub-category. The paper also mentions triangulation, which is a common technique in discrete mathematics, suggesting cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) as a possible sub-category. The paper also involves graph theory, which is a common topic in cs.GR (Graph Theory). Finally, the paper mentions approximation algorithms, which are often used in control theory and optimization, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
