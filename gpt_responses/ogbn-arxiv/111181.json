The focus is on planar graphs and minor-excluded graphs, which are also relevant to graph theory (cs.GT) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper discusses the space and time complexity of the constructions, which is a common theme in algorithms and complexity theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
