It could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category as it involves developing an algorithm for RL. The paper also deals with continuous control problems, which suggests it could belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) or Systems and Control (cs.SY) categories. Finally, the paper leverages recent optimization results for deep neural networks, which suggests it could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
