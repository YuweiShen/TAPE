The paper also discusses the use of container virtualization, which is a technique used in operating systems (cs.OS). Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the emulator, which could fall under the category of computer performance and reliability (cs.CR). Finally, the paper presents a solution to improve the fidelity of network emulations, which could be considered a system-level approach (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
