The proposed Ontological Multidimensional Data Model (OMD model) uses logic-based ontologies, which are also relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses query answering and navigation through dimension hierarchies, which are topics in information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper proposes a new model for representing multidimensional data, which could be of interest to software engineering (cs.SE) researchers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
