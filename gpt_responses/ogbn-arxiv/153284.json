The paper focuses on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of NAS through a novelty search-based approach. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper involves optimizing neural networks, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, since the paper applies the proposed method to natural language processing tasks, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
