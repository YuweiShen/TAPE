This involves capturing semantic correlations between cross-modal instances and boosting the discriminative abilities of hash codes. The paper focuses on multimedia similarity search applications, which suggests that it may belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) or multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of loss functions and graph regularization suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as it deals with retrieval of relevant multimedia data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
