The proposed method, BSN, uses a neural network architecture to generate proposals with high recall and temporal precision. This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses features and classifiers to evaluate the proposals, which suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
