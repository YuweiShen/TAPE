The paper also mentions the use of a weak-supervision loss, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves the analysis of medical images (cs.MM) and the use of computer-aided detection (CADe) systems, which are commonly used in medical imaging. Finally, the paper discusses the potential for expediting the interpretation process and bringing attention to potential findings that could otherwise have been missed, which could fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
