The paper also focuses on improving modularity and reuse, which are topics often discussed in the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The paper establishes a connection between shallow EDSLs and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which is a topic commonly discussed in the Object-Oriented Programming (cs.OO) sub-category. The paper also includes a case study on refactoring a deep external SQL query processor, which is a topic commonly discussed in the Databases (cs.DB) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses examples and techniques from machine learning, which is a topic commonly discussed in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
