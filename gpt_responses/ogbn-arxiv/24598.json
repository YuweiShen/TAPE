Additionally, it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories as it involves the use of machine learning techniques to optimize power flow in a network. The Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper involves the use of a neural network to solve the optimization problem.
