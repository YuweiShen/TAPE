The use of hazard analysis techniques and the design of safety measures also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the discussion of computer-assisted construction of safety cases suggests a potential application in human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
