The simulations mentioned in the paper also suggest the use of computer vision techniques (cs.CV) to learn compensable sensory changes. Finally, the paper's focus on the neuroscience of perception and the emergence of spatial notions suggests a connection to systems and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
