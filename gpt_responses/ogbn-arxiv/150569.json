The paper also discusses the use of Separation Logic for describing data structures such as trees and lists (cs.PL, cs.DS), and the decidability results are obtained by reduction to Monadic Second Order Logic on graphs with bounded tree width (cs.FL, cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
