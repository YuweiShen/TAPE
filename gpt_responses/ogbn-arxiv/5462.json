However, the main focus of the paper is on the information theory and networking aspects of the problem, which suggests that cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a majorization-minimization approach to solve the nonconvex optimization problem, which involves techniques from optimization and machine learning, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.MM (Machine Learning) likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper presents simulation results and compares its approach to a classical block-diagonalization strategy, which involves performance evaluation and analysis, indicating that cs.LG (Machine Learning) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
