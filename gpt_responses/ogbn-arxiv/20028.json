This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper considers a secondary user equipped with multiple antennas that superimposes its own messages along with the primary transmission, which is a multimedia communication scenario. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper uses optimization tools such as semidefinite programming and second-order cone programming to find the optimal solution for the non-convex design problem, which falls under the domain of computational engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
