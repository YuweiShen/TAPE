The system is implemented using an encoder-decoder architecture and trained using a conditional GAN strategy, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of neglect nodes, which are a type of graph-based algorithm, indicating a possible connection to computer graphics (cs.GR).
