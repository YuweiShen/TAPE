The use of differentiable image-space distance and probabilistic keypoint maps suggests that the paper is likely to be related to computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR). The optimization of network weights for better reconstruction results suggests that the paper may also be related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of multiview images and perceptual study suggests that the paper may also be related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
