The paper proposes a new method that uses a separable component called data calibrator to help the fixed source classifier recover discrimination power in the target domain. This method is evaluated on digits datasets and driving scene semantic segmentation, which are both common tasks in computer vision and fall under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of GANs, which are commonly used in computer vision and machine learning, and therefore the paper could also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper proposes a new method for domain adaptation, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence, and therefore the paper could also fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper uses adversarial attacks, which are commonly used in neural networks, and therefore the paper could also fall under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with semantic segmentation, which is a common task in natural language processing, and therefore the paper could also fall under the computation and language (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
