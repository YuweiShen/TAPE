The paper also introduces a new module that is trained end-to-end with trainable offsets, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques, making cs.LG and cs.AI likely sub-categories as well. The paper also establishes location-aware losses, which could fall under the sub-categories of cs.NE (neural networks) and cs.CL (computational linguistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
