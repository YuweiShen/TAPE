The proposed coding scheme involves quasi-group codes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the achievable rate region, which is a topic in network information theory (cs.NI). The problem of doubly-dirty MAC with modulo-$4$ addition is investigated, which involves signal processing and communication (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents a new computable single-letter characterization, which is a topic in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
