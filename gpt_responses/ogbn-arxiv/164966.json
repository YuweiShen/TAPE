The proposed method involves training a super-network and sampling sub-networks from it, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also introduces a novel method for sampling sub-networks based on a posteriori probability, which involves probabilistic modeling and inference, making it relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
