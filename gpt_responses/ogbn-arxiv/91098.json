The approach uses off-policy reinforcement learning to estimate optimal value functions for multiple action spaces simultaneously. This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with the problem of efficient learning in complex tasks, which is a core problem in artificial intelligence. The use of a curriculum of progressively growing action spaces is a common technique in AI, making cs.AI a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper's approach has potential applications in robotics, where agents need to learn to perform complex tasks efficiently. The use of off-policy reinforcement learning to estimate optimal value functions is a common technique in robotics, making cs.RO a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper's approach is tested on challenging large-scale StarCraft micromanagement tasks with large, multi-agent action spaces. This falls under the domain of multiagent systems, making cs.MA a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper's approach involves setting an internal curriculum by initially restricting the agent's action space. This falls under the domain of systems and control, making cs.SY a"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
