The paper also discusses the use of machine learning methods, which is a common topic in the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The selection criteria used in the framework also involve relevant features such as linguistic complexity and context dependence, which are important topics in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI).
