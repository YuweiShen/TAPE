This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Game Theory (cs.GT) and Mechanism Design (cs.ME) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of decision makers as games, which could fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also discusses the function that yields abstract Nash equilibria, which could fall under the Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
