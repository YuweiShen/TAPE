The paper proposes an extension to existing languages, which involves formal operational calculi (cs.FL) and implementation (cs.SE). Finally, the paper uses the system Toy, which is a tool for exploring the semantics of programming languages, and thus could be classified under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
