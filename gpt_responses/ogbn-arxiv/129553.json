The evaluation of the proposed attack involves the use of deep neural networks (cs.LG) and the reconstruction of visual information from encrypted images (cs.MM). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of privacy preservation in the context of deep learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
