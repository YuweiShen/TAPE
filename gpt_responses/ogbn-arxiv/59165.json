This falls under the scope of computational linguistics (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR) as the authors use NLP techniques to extract information from unstructured text. The use of semantic notions of events, participants, and roles suggests the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The authors also mention the use of graph-based representation, which falls under the scope of deep learning (cs.DL) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
