The use of deep learning algorithms for this purpose suggests that the paper may also belong to the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the procedural generation of synthetic cryptographic binaries, which may fall under the category of software engineering (cs.SE).
