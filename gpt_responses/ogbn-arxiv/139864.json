Additionally, the paper discusses the efficiency of the outcomes of the induced game, which could also place it in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The use of coordination mechanisms and scheduling policies could also suggest that the paper belongs to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-categories.
