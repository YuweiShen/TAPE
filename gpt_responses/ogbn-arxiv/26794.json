The paper also mentions a quantization scheme, which is a common topic in information theory and signal processing (cs.IT, cs.SP). The use of a quadratic cost function and the study of tradeoffs between communication rate and expected cost are also common in optimization and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.MA). Finally, the paper mentions recent results on vector quantization, which is a subfield of information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
