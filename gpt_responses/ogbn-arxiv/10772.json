This involves solving for robot dimensions, masses, and other physical parameters concurrently with traditional motion planning variables. The paper also demonstrates the results on four simulated robots and physically fabricated one of them. Given the focus on robot optimization and motion planning, the most likely sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves optimization techniques, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper involves simulations and physical fabrication, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
