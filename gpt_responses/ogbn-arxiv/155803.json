The paper proposes a rigorous analytical model for 802.11 stations' throughput and airtime in multi-rate settings, which involves optimization and convex optimization techniques (cs.IT). The paper also evaluates the proposed scheme through experiments in a real deployment, which involves multimedia streaming and TCP download times (cs.MM). The paper proposes a practical solution for the problem of performance anomaly, which involves the implementation of the proposed scheme on commodity access points (cs.SY). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of high throughput enhancements in 802.11n/ac, which is a key challenge in the field of network security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
