The domain of simulated RoboCup soccer involves robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV) as the agents must perceive the environment and make decisions based on it. Additionally, the use of deep reinforcement learning involves optimizing a policy over time, which is a control problem that falls under the systems and control subfield (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
