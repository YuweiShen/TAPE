The study also involves testing the method in various environments, including grid world and Atari games, which could fall under robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper proposes a new method to address the negative effects of a large replay buffer, which could also fall under systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
