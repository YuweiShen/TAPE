The paper proposes a new method called probability thresholding bagging (PT-bagging) that combines bagging ensemble with threshold-moving to address this problem. This method is applicable to both binary and multiclass data sets. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper also discusses performance measures and biases in the model, which are relevant to the sub-categories cs.DM (Data Mining) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
