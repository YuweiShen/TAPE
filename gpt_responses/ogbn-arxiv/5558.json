The use of Hamilton-Jacobi reachability and sequential path planning also involves optimization and decision-making, which are areas covered by artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the simulations mentioned in the paper suggest that the authors may have used numerical methods or algorithms, which could fall under the category of mathematical optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
