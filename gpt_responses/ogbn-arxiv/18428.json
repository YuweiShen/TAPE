The proposed method aims to improve the performance of cross-modal retrieval, which is a common task in computer vision.\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper also deals with natural language processing, as it involves aligning visual and textual representations in a shared embedding space. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with multimodal data, specifically visual and textual data, and proposes a method to improve the performance of cross-modal retrieval. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper proposes a method to adjust similarities between entities in a shared embedding space, which is relevant to information retrieval tasks. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel module that continuously deforms the embedding space, which is a machine learning technique."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
