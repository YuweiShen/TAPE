This involves factorizing an agent's skills into a collection of primitives, which can be activated simultaneously via multiplicative composition. This approach involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques to enable the agent to learn and reuse skills. The use of complex high-dimensional morphologies, such as humanoid bodies, suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper mentions tasks such as motion imitation and object transportation, which involve computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY) respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
