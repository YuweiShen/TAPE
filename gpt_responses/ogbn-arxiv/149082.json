The problem involves leveraging the knowledge of side information of all the receivers, which is a common theme in the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The paper also introduces the notion of joint extensions of a finite number of sub-problems, which is related to the topic of Combinatorics (cs.DS).
