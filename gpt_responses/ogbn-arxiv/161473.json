The use of genie signals and time sharing techniques suggest a focus on network information theory (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also mentions closed-form expressions, which could indicate a focus on mathematical modeling (cs.MM) and communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
