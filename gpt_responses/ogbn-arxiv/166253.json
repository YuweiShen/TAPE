The core of the approach is a 3D articulated Gaussian mixture alignment strategy tailored to hand-object tracking that allows fast pose optimization. The paper extensively evaluates the proposed method on several existing datasets and introduces a new annotated hand-object dataset. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The proposed method has potential applications in wearable computing and tangible computing, which are closely related to robotics. \n3. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper deals with tracking hands manipulating and interacting with external objects, which is a common problem in computer graphics. \n4. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper proposes a real-time solution for hand-object tracking, which has potential applications in augmented reality and human-computer interaction. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with tracking hands manipulating and interacting with external objects, which is a common problem in multimedia applications such as virtual reality and gaming."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
