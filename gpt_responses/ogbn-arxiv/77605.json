The use of a trusted agent and the consideration of side information suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-fields of distributed systems (cs.DS) and computer networks (cs.CC). Finally, the combinatorial conjecture mentioned in the abstract may be of interest to researchers in the area of discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
