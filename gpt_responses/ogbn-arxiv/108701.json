It also involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it proposes a new scheme for training object detectors using automatic learning algorithms. Additionally, it involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it uses human verification to improve the learning algorithm. The paper also deals with natural language processing (cs.CL) as it involves text-based annotations. Finally, it involves multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with image and video data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
