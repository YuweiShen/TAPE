The paper also covers object pose estimation, scene reconstruction, and human actions, which are all relevant to computer vision. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as it discusses camera tracking and object tracking, which are important for robotics applications. The paper also mentions machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as relevant areas for RGBD datasets. Finally, the paper touches on graphics (cs.GR) as it suggests future directions may include synthetic data and dense reconstructions of static and dynamic scenes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
