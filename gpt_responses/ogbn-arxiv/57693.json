The use of typed linear algebra and strong type checking is a machine learning technique (cs.LG) that is increasingly being applied to database systems. The implementation of a kernel of LA operators is a data structures and algorithms problem (cs.DS). The evaluation of the approach using TPC-H benchmark queries involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques such as optimization and performance tuning. Finally, the comparison with popular database competitors is a systems and infrastructure problem (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
