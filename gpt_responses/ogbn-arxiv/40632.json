The use of Kolmogorov's complexity theory and Chaitin's algorithmic information also suggests a connection to neural networks (cs.NE) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the mention of perceptual and cognitive processing implies a human-computer interaction aspect, which falls under human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
