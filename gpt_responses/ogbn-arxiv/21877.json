It is also likely to belong to the Communications (cs.COMM) sub-category as it mentions optical communication systems. The paper's focus on throughput and latency suggests it could also belong to the Distributed Systems (cs.DS) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's use of simulations and performance analysis suggests it could also belong to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
