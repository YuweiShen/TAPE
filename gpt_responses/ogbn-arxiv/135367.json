This involves real-time adaptation of the glider's behavior to the time-varying and noisy conditions associated with thermal soaring flight. The paper also emphasizes keeping low computational requirements in order to make on-board execution feasible. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are Robotics (cs.RO), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Systems and Control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper involves machine learning techniques, which could place it in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
