Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of proposals and handling objects in multiple scales, which could relate to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
