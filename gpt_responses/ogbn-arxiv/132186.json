The paper also proposes a novel network architecture, which involves training with a curriculum learning strategy, and a proposal calibration module, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category. The paper also involves the use of multi-label classification, object detection, and instance segmentation, which are all subfields of AI, hence it could belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category. The paper also evaluates its performance on standard benchmarks, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.MM (Multimedia) category. Finally, the paper involves label propagation, which is a common technique in information retrieval, hence it could belong to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
