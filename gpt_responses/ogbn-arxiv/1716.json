Therefore, this sub-category is also a possible match.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the localization of sound sources, which is a topic related to multimedia applications. Therefore, this sub-category is also a possible match.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses sparsity in the terms of voxels in a room that are occupied by a source to localize sound sources, which is a topic related to information theory. Therefore, this sub-category is also a possible match."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
