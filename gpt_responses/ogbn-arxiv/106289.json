Additionally, the use of bag-of-words model suggests that it may also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The use of character-enhanced word vectors suggests that it may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
