The proposed method involves cross-modal matching of text and video representations, which is also relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) research. The use of regression to output action boundary results suggests a machine learning (cs.AI) approach, and the joint modeling of text and video features is a common technique in deep learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
