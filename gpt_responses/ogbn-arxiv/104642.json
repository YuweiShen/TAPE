This is a fundamental topic in computational geometry.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions that computational QC geometry has made significant contributions to computer vision. The development of PCQC maps and PCBCs can potentially be applied to computer vision tasks.\n3. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper mentions that computational QC geometry has made significant contributions to computer graphics. The development of PCQC maps and PCBCs can potentially be applied to graphics tasks.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper mentions that computational QC geometry has made significant contributions to medical imaging. The development of PCQC maps and PCBCs can potentially be applied to medical imaging tasks.\n5. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper discusses the convergence of PCBCs to their continuous counterpart as the density of the point cloud tends to zero.
