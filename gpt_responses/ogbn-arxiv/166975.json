The paper also mentions the need for low latency and massive connectivity, which are important aspects of networked systems (cs.SI). The use of OFDM-like multicarrier schemes and the need for robustness with respect to asynchronism suggest that the paper may also belong to the networked systems sub-category (cs.NI). The paper also presents a new pilot scheme, which involves phase retrieval, a topic that falls under machine learning and optimization (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
