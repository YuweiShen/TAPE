Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also uses machine learning (ML) algorithms to achieve high accuracy in fact annotation, which makes cs.AI and cs.LG likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper involves information retrieval (IR) techniques to localize visual facts in images, which makes cs.IR a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
