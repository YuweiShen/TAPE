The paper also discusses the use of a Markov random field (MRF) model, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper is focused on improving the performance of autonomous driving systems, which is a topic relevant to computer networks and communications (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
