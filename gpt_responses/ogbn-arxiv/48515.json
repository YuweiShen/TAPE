The paper also makes use of erasure codes (cs.DS) and randomness extractors (cs.CC), which are common tools in coding theory and theoretical computer science. Finally, the paper discusses open problems related to non-malleable secret sharing, which could be of interest to researchers in the area of complexity theory (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
