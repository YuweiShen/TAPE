This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) as it involves coding and transmission of information over a communication channel. The use of MIMO systems and dirty-paper coding also suggests that the paper could be related to multimedia (cs.MM) applications. The proposed algorithms involve optimization and machine learning techniques, which are common in signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. Finally, the problem of power constraint is also relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) where energy efficiency is a key concern."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
