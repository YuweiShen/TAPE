Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), which deals with image and video processing, including CNNs. The paper also involves optimization of quantization parameters, which falls under the sub-categories of machine learning and artificial intelligence, i.e., cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with hardware implementation, which could be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
