This falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also discusses algorithms for merging BWTs, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) or distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper uses techniques from succinct data structures, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
