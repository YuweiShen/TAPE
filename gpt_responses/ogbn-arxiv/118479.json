This is a common task in computer vision and graphics, and is typically addressed using deep learning techniques. The paper proposes an extension to an existing real-time style transfer algorithm that allows for direct control of stylization strength at inference time. This involves modifying the weighting factors of content and style losses, which are key components of the algorithm. Given this focus on image manipulation and deep learning, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV), graphics (cs.GR), multimedia (cs.MM), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
