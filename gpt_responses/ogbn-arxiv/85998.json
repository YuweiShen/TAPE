The use of deep learning methods also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The Siamese framework used in the proposed method is also a common technique in deep learning for similarity learning, which could place this paper in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the use of predictive coding theory in the proposed method suggests that it could also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
