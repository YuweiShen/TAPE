The proposed method involves using edge-attention representations to guide the segmentation network, which is a technique commonly used in deep learning (cs.LG). The authors also mention using transfer learning to transfer the edge-attention representations from the early encoding layers to the multi-scale decoding layers, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper focuses on segmentation tasks in retinal images and lung segmentation in chest X-Ray and CT images, which are subfields of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the authors mention using a weighted aggregation module to fuse the edge-attention representations, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
