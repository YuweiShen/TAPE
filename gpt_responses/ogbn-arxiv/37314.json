The specific problems mentioned, such as SparsestCut, BalancedSeparator, MaxCut, Matching, and IndependentSet, are all related to graph theory and combinatorial optimization, suggesting that the paper may also fit into categories such as cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), cs.CG (computational geometry), and cs.LG (machine learning). Finally, the mention of integrality gaps and SDP relaxations suggests a connection to optimization theory and game theory, which could place the paper in the cs.GT (computer science and game theory) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
