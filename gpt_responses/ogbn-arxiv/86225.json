It also discusses applications in information theory, specifically in the context of information transmission systems (cs.IT). The paper introduces a new framework for analyzing these games, which involves high probability guarantees, and provides a counterpart to a classical result in zero-sum repeated games. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), systems and control (cs.SY), and machine learning (cs.LG), which often involve analyzing and optimizing probabilistic guarantees."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
