This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) as it deals with the proprioception of soft robots. The use of an embedded camera and deep learning techniques for shape estimation suggests computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) as likely sub-categories. Finally, the real-time computation aspect of the framework suggests control systems (cs.SY) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
