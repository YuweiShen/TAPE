Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning models for building cross-camera correlation models, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper proposes techniques for reducing compute workload, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper discusses the use of historical traffic patterns, which could also suggest that it belongs to cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
