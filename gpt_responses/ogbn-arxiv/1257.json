The experiments are conducted on image datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet), which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of knowledge distillation, which is a popular technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper proposes a new approach for knowledge distillation, which falls under the category of deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
