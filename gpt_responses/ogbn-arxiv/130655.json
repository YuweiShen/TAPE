The use of distance oracles is a common technique in graph algorithms, and hence the paper is likely to be classified under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The problem of reconstructing graphs is also closely related to computational geometry, and hence cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is another likely category. The paper also involves analyzing the query complexity of the algorithms, which is a topic in cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper involves probabilistic algorithms, which is a topic in cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Finally, the paper involves reconstructing specific types of graphs, such as degree-bounded and outerplanar graphs, which could potentially fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
