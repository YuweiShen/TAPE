It also describes the operations of current state-of-the-art E2E voting systems, which involves algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The challenges to the deployment of E2E voting systems include legal and usability constraints, which are related to cyber law and human-computer interaction (cs.CY, cs.LG). Finally, the paper aims to make the innovations in this domain accessible to a wider audience, which involves software engineering and user experience (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
