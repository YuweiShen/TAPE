This suggests a strong connection to computational linguistics. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper deals with Visual Question Answering (VQA), which is a task that involves both computer vision and natural language processing. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes and tests different continual learning methods to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, which is a common problem in machine learning. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with a task that requires both computer vision and natural language processing, which are two key areas of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses neural multimodal approaches to VQA, which suggests a connection to neural computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
