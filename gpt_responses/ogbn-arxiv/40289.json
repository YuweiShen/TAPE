The paper also introduces a new concept called AD-k, which is a generalization of monotonicity and submodularity, and applies it to the spread of influence. This makes it likely that the paper would also fall under the categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper is focused on theoretical results and proofs, which suggests that it would be classified under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
