The paper specifically focuses on the design of a data-aided secure downlink transmission scheme to combat active eavesdropping, which is a problem that falls under the purview of all these sub-categories. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT, followed by cs.NI, cs.CR, cs.MM, and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
