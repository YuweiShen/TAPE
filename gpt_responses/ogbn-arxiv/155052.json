This involves optimizing the transmission of information, which falls under the purview of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with ad hoc networks, which are a type of wireless network. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a coordinated beamformer in a cooperative scheme, which involves controlling the transmission of signals. This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with wireless transmission of data, which may include multimedia content. This falls under the domain of multimedia.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper involves analytical results to prove the aptitude of the proposed methodology, which involves computational techniques. This falls under the domain of computational engineering, finance, and science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
