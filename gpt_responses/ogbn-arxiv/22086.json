The paper also discusses the use of Gaussian codebooks, which is a common technique in communication networks (cs.NI). The paper presents new outer bounds and achievable rate regions, which are topics in optimization and control theory (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of frequency bands and subspaces, which are topics in signal processing and machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of different types of Gaussian ICs, which is a topic in statistical learning and pattern recognition (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
