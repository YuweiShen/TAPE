The motivation for the problem comes from statistical genetics, which could fall under information theory (cs.IT) or systems and control (cs.SI). The method is based on analyzing conditional distributions, which could also be relevant to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
