The use of feedback in communication systems is also a well-studied problem in control theory and networking (cs.NI), and the paper specifically investigates the impact of feedback on the secrecy capacity. The paper also mentions the use of cooperative jamming, which is a technique commonly used in physical layer security (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with the Gaussian two-way wiretap channel, which is a common model in signal processing and communication theory (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
