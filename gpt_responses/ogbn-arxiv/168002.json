The use of 360$^{\\circ}$ cameras and the need to recognize actions in a wide field-of-view suggest that the paper is likely to be in the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The proposed weakly-supervised method also involves multi-instance multi-label learning, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.MM) and the paper proposes a new dataset for action recognition, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. The use of 3D CNNs for feature extraction and the proposed weakly-supervised method also suggest that the paper may be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
