Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves multiple users and a single server, which falls under the sub-category of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The proposed scheme is based on multiple groupcast index coding, which is related to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper involves coding and optimization, which falls under the sub-category of cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
