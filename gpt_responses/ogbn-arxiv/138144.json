The language of Epistemic Specifications, which is the focus of the paper, is a type of modal logic (cs.LO) and is used to reason about knowledge and belief. The paper also discusses the use of rules, which is a topic in Programming Languages (cs.PL). The practical use of epistemic logic programs for problem solving involves the development of efficient solvers, which is a topic in Computational Logic (cs.CL) and Software Engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
