This involves learning a state representation directly from the images using a deep spatial autoencoder, which suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) sub-categories. The focus on robotic motion skills and closed-loop control suggests that the paper is also likely to be relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
