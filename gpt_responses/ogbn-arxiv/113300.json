The paper presents a new algorithm for this problem that improves upon the previous best-known worst-case bit complexity, which suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
