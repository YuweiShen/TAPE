This approach is designed to be more robust to model imperfections and requires less experience to match the asymptotic performance of model-free methods. Given these characteristics, the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
