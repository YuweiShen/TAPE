It could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as it involves the development of a custom-built 3D fully convolutional network. Additionally, it could belong to the medical imaging (cs.MED) sub-category as it deals with pancreas segmentation in computed tomography imaging. Finally, it could also belong to the neuroscience and physics (cs.NEURON) sub-category as it involves the analysis of medical images."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
