Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves physical scattering models, which could fall under cs.GR (Graphics) or cs.MM (Multimedia). The use of regularization techniques and modeling could also fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
