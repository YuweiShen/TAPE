The proposed solution uses Hadoop, a popular distributed computing framework for big data processing, to efficiently analyze large volumes of network traffic data (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of MapReduce and HDFS, which are key components of Hadoop (cs.DC, cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation and evaluation of a testbed, which involves software engineering and performance evaluation (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
