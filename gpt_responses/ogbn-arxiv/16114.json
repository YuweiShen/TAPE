The paper also proposes new features and combines them with existing ones, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning algorithms (cs.LG). The proposed method is also related to robotics (cs.RO) as it can be used for pedestrian detection in autonomous vehicles. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method in terms of miss rate, which is related to computer security (cs.CR) as it can be used for surveillance and threat detection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
