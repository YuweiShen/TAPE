It could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it discusses the effectiveness of the proposed modification on learning accuracies during training. Additionally, it could be classified under Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) as it proposes a new approach to improve the performance of neural networks. The paper also mentions the use of the modified activation function in real-world datasets, which suggests it could be relevant to Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
