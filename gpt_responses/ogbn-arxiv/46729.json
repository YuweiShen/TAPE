The proposed model is based on a dynamical structure, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the fields of control theory and robotics (cs.SY). The use of alternating minimizations to estimate the latent variables is a common optimization technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM). Overall, the paper's focus on spectral unmixing and dynamical modeling suggests that it is most likely to belong to cs.CV or cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
