The paper also focuses on understanding human behaviors in interactive environments, which can be categorized under human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of inverse RL to model the underlying value structure of players is related to game theory (cs.GT) and social influence (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
