The application of this technique is for predicting pedestrian intentions in naturalistic driving conditions, which involves robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also uses CNN-based methods, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of pedestrian safety, which is relevant to computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
