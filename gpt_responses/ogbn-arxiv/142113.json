It is also likely to belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as it evaluates the robustness of the trackers to occlusion and challenging interactions between a person and the object. The paper also discusses the training methodology and the optimization of parameters, which suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper presents a pipeline for acquiring accurate ground truth poses of real objects, which could make it relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
