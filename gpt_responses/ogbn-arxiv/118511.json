The use of neural nets to implement the drift and diffusion coefficients of the stochastic differential equation (SDE) also suggests the sub-categories of neural networks (cs.NE) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the development of a variational inference framework involves information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
