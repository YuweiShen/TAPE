This involves real-time collision-free motion planning for a system of robots, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also involves the use of a decentralized model-predictive controller, which falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The algorithm is scalable in the number of robots, which involves system-level considerations and falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The paper also involves the use of computation to identify collision-free configurations and compute 3-D payload configurations, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
