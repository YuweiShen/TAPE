It also involves developing an algorithm for training a classifier, which is a common task in machine learning. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the use of crowdsourcing and noisy labels is a common problem in AI research. \n\nThe paper also involves human-computer interaction (HCI) as it deals with crowdsourcing and the interaction between workers and the algorithm. Therefore, it could belong to cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). \n\nThe use of bandits and exploration is a common technique in reinforcement learning, which falls under the sub-category of cs.SI (Systems and Control). \n\nFinally, the paper involves analyzing and proving guarantees on the number of tasks labeled by workers, which is a common problem in data management.
