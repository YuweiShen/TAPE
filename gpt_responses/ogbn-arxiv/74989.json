The attacks involve constructing adversarial examples, which suggests the use of machine learning (cs.AI) and specifically adversarial machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves visual content analysis (cs.CV) and explores the design space of perceptual ad-blockers, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the potential vulnerabilities introduced by perceptual ad-blocking, which could fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
