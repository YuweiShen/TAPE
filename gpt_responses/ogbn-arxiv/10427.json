This methodology is illustrated with application to two topics: complex networks (CN) and photonic crystals (PC). The paper is focused on the analysis of scientific literature and the use of computational tools to extract information from large-scale datasets. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DL (Digital Libraries), which deals with the development of systems and tools for managing and accessing large-scale digital collections. Other likely sub-categories include cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which deals with the development of algorithms and systems for searching and retrieving information from large-scale datasets, cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), which deals with the analysis of social and information networks, cs.SD (Software Development), which deals with the development of software tools and systems, and cs.CY (Computers and Society), which deals with the social and ethical implications of computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
