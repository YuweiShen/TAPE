The system presented, explAIner, is a visual analytics tool that instantiates the suggested pipeline within the TensorBoard environment. The paper focuses on the user experience and includes a user study to evaluate the workflow. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.HCI. However, the paper also deals with machine learning models, XAI methods, and data management, which are relevant to several other categories such as cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.IR, and cs.DB."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
