The use of quadratic polynomials and the search for elements with specific properties suggest that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Computational Complexity (cs.CC) categories. The study of the properties of the polynomials and the demonstration of their APN status may also fall under the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) category. The use of algebraic structures and the search for specific elements may also suggest the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category. Finally, the application of the results to the design of cryptographic functions may also fall under the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
