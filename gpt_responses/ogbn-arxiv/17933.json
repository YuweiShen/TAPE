The proposed method involves modeling the potential outcomes as a three-dimensional tensor of low rank, and setting up a weighted tensor completion problem as the estimation procedure. This involves solving an optimization problem, which can be done using projected gradient descent. All of these techniques are commonly used in machine learning, making cs.LG the most likely sub-category. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new method for causal inference, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence. The proposed method involves modeling the potential outcomes as a three-dimensional tensor of low rank, and setting up a weighted tensor completion problem as the estimation procedure.
