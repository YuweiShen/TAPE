The paper proposes a novel tracking framework that utilizes deep learning techniques and correlation filters. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves online learning and adaptive fusion, which are related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, so cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions motion estimation and object occlusion, which are related to multimedia and robotics, so cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.RO (Robotics) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
