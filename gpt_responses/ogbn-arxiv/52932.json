The use of regularization strategies and ensemble learning also suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of label smoothing, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL) but can also be applied to image classification tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
