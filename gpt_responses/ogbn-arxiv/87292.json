The paper proposes a new structure for hierarchical policy learning that uses a temporal gate to adaptively control the high-level policy decision frequency. This approach is tested in a range of environments including 2-D rooms, Mujoco tasks, and Atari games. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
