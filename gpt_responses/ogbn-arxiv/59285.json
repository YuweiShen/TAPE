The focus on scientific communication and evolving literatures suggests a connection to information retrieval (cs.IR) and digital libraries (cs.DL). The discussion of networks and trajectories may also be relevant to social informatics (cs.SI) and computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the concept of discursive knowledge could be related to software engineering (cs.SE) or systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
