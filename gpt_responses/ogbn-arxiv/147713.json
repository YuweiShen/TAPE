The paper also addresses the issue of incomplete and noisy observations, which is a common problem in robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of a generative model for belief updating is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and the use of a surrogate loss function is a technique commonly used in optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
