The paper also mentions the use of propositional relaxed planning graphs (RPGs), which are a popular tool in planning research (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the use of mathematical programs for numeric reasoning, which is a topic that falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and optimization (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the integration of different components to produce a unified heuristic, which is a topic that falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
