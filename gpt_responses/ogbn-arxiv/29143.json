This falls under the scope of information retrieval, making cs.IR the most likely category.\n\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - The paper proposes a semi-automatic text mining technique to extract useful text patterns from ideas posted on crowdsourcing applications. This involves natural language processing techniques, which falls under the scope of cs.CL.\n\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with crowdsourcing applications, which are social networks where people collaborate to generate ideas. This falls under the scope of social and information networks.\n\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses the challenges of identifying potential ideas from crowdsourcing applications, which has implications for the societal impact of technology. This falls under the scope of computers and society.\n\n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - The paper discusses the online opinions of people who gave comments and votes on the ideas, which involves the interaction between humans and computers. This falls under the scope of human-computer interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
