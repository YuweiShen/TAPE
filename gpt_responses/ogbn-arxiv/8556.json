The approach involves deriving keyword search candidates, designing an XML keyword search diversification model, and proposing efficient algorithms to evaluate the generated query candidates. This work involves techniques from database systems (cs.DB) for searching XML data, information retrieval (cs.IR) for keyword search, data structures (cs.DS) for efficient algorithms, artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for feature selection, and computational linguistics (cs.CL) for dealing with ambiguity in keyword queries."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
