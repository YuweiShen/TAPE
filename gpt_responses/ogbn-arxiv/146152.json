Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper also involves feature extraction and machine learning techniques, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The proposed method also involves rejecting non-text regions, which can be seen as a classification problem, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper involves evaluation of the proposed method on benchmark datasets, which is commonly done in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
