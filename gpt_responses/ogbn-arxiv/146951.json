The paper proposes a scheduling algorithm that takes into account the Markov time-varying channel states and the bandwidth constraint. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.MA (Multiagent Systems), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
