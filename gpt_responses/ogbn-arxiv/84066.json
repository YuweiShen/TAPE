This involves learning non-linear transformations to a shared subspace that maximizes the ratio of between- and within-modality covariance of the observations. This work is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
