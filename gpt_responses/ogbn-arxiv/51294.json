The use of fractional frequency reuse (FFR) and traffic classification also involves information theory (cs.IT) and communication systems (cs.COMM). The coexistence of small cells and macrocells and the need to ensure quality of service (QoS) level also relates to system and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions performance analysis, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) if it involves analyzing video or audio quality."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
