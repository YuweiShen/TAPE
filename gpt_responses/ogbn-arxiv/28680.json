The proposed method involves using a LiDAR and a single color camera, which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as another likely category. The paper also mentions the use of deep learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.AI) for reducing false positives and validating detections. Finally, the system involves control and decision-making for collision avoidance, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
