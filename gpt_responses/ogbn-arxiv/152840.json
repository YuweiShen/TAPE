This methodology involves training a global LSTM network that exploits the nonlinear demand relationships available in an E-commerce product assortment hierarchy. The paper also proposes a systematic pre-processing framework to overcome the challenges in an E-commerce setting and introduces several product grouping strategies to supplement the LSTM learning schemes. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
