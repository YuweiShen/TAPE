The paper also considers distributed computation over a network, which is related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper proposes coding schemes that can tolerate adversarial noise, which is related to cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper deals with the efficiency of the proposed schemes, which is related to complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
