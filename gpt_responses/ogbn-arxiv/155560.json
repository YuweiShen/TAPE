Computer vision techniques may be used for processing the data. \n3. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The proposed deep learning architecture is a neural network. \n4. cs.BIO (Computational Biology and Bioinformatics): The paper discusses the importance of continuous monitoring of cardiac health and proposes a method for monitoring individuals in free living conditions. \n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The proposed method can allow for seamless monitoring of individuals using household objects like chairs, beds, and car seats, which may have implications for human-computer interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
