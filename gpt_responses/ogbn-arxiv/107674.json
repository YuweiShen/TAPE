The paper also focuses on multi-class classification, which falls under the category of data mining (cs.DM). The use of oblique decision surfaces and random vector functional link network suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper proposes an ensemble classifier, which is a common topic in the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
