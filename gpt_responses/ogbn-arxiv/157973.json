The algorithm is based on an accelerated variant of orthogonal least-squares, which is a technique from numerical analysis. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers papers on algorithms and models for machine learning, which is the main focus of the paper.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category covers papers on computer vision, which is the application area of sparse subspace clustering.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category covers papers on mathematical foundations of information processing, which is relevant to the optimization techniques used in the paper.\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): This sub-category covers papers on numerical methods for solving mathematical problems, which is relevant to the orthogonal least-squares algorithm used in the paper.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category covers papers on algorithms and data structures, which is relevant to the design and analysis of the proposed algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
