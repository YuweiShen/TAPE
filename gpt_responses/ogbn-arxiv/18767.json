This approach involves requirements analysis in the personalization lifecycle, and the use of scenarios to identify and analyze personalization requirements. The paper also discusses the use of explanation-based generalization (EBG) and partial evaluation to realize high-level goals and needs identified in scenarios. Based on this, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction), as the paper discusses techniques for modeling and personalizing user interaction with information systems. The paper also discusses information retrieval (cs.IR) and software engineering (cs.SE) aspects of personalization, which are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the underlying equivalence of EBG and partial evaluation, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
