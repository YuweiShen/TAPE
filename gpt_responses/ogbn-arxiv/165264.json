This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Systems and Control (cs.SY). However, given the focus on deep learning models and their inference, cs.CV and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.LG and cs.DC, and cs.SY as the least likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
