The proposed approach involves coordination among base stations and distributed interference suppression, which relates to system and control (cs.SY). The paper also evaluates the performance of different schemes for sub-6 GHz deployments, which involves measurements and modeling (cs.MM) and augmented reality (cs.AR) for visualization of the results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
