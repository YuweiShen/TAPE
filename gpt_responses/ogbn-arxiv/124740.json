However, the focus on camera exposure control and the practical applications mentioned in the abstract suggest that cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The use of off-the-shelf machine-vision cameras and the mention of visual odometry and stereo matching also suggest that cs.RO (Robotics) is a likely sub-category. The mention of panoramic imaging and surround-view imaging suggests that cs.MM (Multimedia) could also be a relevant sub-category. The use of a control algorithm suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) could be another relevant sub-category. Finally, the mention of pedestrian detection suggests that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
