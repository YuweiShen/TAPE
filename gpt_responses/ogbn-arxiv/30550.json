The paper proposes a new framework for learning hash functions using affinity-based loss functions, which involves optimization techniques (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of supervised and unsupervised datasets, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper mentions the design of optimization algorithms for arbitrary types of loss and hash functions, which is related to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
