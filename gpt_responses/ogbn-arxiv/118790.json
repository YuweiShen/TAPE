The method involves differential privacy, which is a topic in \"cs.CR\" (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses optimization techniques, which are relevant to \"cs.DS\" (Data Structures and Algorithms) and \"cs.IT\" (Information Theory). Finally, the paper applies the proposed method to train deep neural nets, which is a subfield of \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
