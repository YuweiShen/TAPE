Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses practical aspects of the process, such as volume of training data and intrinsic evaluation metrics, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) respectively. Additionally, the paper uses a single GPU for training, which could be relevant to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.SD (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
