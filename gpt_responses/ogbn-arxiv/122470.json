The paper proposes a linear SLAM technique that is applicable to feature-based SLAM, pose graph SLAM, and D-SLAM, which are all related to robotics and computer vision. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves solving linear least squares problems, which is related to machine learning and optimization, and thus cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with the integration of submaps, which is related to control systems, and thus cs.SY (Systems and Control) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
