This suggests a strong connection to information theory.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses techniques from machine learning and deep learning to train a maximum-likelihood detector. This suggests a connection to neural computing.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents a new experimental platform that can be expanded to simulate different environments, including complex networks of pipes in industrial complexes and city infrastructures. This suggests a connection to systems and control.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper presents a communication system where different chemicals are used to represent bits, and information is carried via pH signals. This suggests a connection to multimedia.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper presents an experimental platform that can be used to simulate different environments, including the cardiovascular system. This suggests a connection to computational engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
