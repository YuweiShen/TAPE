This falls under computational geometry (cs.CG) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses approximation algorithms, which are often studied in the context of algorithms and complexity (cs.DM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper includes experimental results, which could be relevant to graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
