The use of approximation algorithms suggests that the paper may belong to the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The study of algorithms for constraint satisfaction problems also suggests that the paper may belong to the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The use of surjective mappings and the investigation of their relation with Max-CSPs suggests that the paper may belong to the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The focus on maximizing the number of satisfied constraints suggests that the paper may belong to the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of complexity dichotomy suggests that the paper may belong to the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
