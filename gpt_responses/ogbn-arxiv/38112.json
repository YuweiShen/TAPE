This is a core topic in constraint satisfaction and optimization.\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the implementation of the proposed propagator using a decomposition that extends the bounds consistency enforcing decomposition proposed for the AllDifferent constraint. This involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms.\n3. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with combinatorial problems such as instruction scheduling and symmetry breaking, which are typically studied in discrete mathematics.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new global constraint that can be used in various AI applications such as scheduling and symmetry breaking.\n5. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses the complexity of enforcing domain consistency on the proposed global constraint, which is a topic in logic and complexity theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
