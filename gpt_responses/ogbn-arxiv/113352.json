Additionally, the paper focuses on computer vision tasks, specifically image classification, which suggests that it could also belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also involves optimizing the CNN structure and connectivity, which could fall under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. As the proposed method involves automated design, it could also be categorized under Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of highly functional modules and optimization for validation accuracy could suggest that the paper could also belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
