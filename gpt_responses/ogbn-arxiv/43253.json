The paper also discusses the issue of inter-annotator agreement, which is relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed procedures for improving inter-annotator agreement involve conditioning the ground truths, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.AI). Finally, the use of the ISIC Archive, which is a database of skin lesion images, suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
