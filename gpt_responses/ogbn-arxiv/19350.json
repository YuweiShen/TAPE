Therefore, cs.CL is the most likely category for this paper.\n\n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper focuses on online abusive behavior, which is a social phenomenon that occurs on information networks. Therefore, cs.SI is also a likely category for this paper.\n\n3. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the impact of online abuse on victims and the need for a just and comprehensive strategy to address this issue. Therefore, cs.CY is another likely category for this paper.\n\n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the development of proactive technologies to counter or inhibit online abuse, which may involve security and cryptography techniques. Therefore, cs.CR is a possible category for this paper.\n\n5. cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the need for a comprehensive strategy to address online abuse, which may involve software engineering techniques. Therefore, cs.SD is another possible category for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
