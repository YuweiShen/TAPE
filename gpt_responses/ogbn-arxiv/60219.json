The use of transfer learning techniques and the development of different models adapted to the binary problem of identifying if an image was or not computer generated suggest that the paper also falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The application of these techniques to the detection of fake images in the context of the current \"Fake News/Post-Truth\" era may also make the paper relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
