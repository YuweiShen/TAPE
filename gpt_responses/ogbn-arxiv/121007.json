The paper proposes a new algorithm called COSINE that reduces the memory footprint and accelerates the training process by sharing parameters among similar nodes. This algorithm can be applied to any embedding lookup method and learn high-quality embeddings with limited memory and shorter training time. Based on this description, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DB (Databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
