The use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of recurrent neural networks (RNN) for micro-expression detection suggests a focus on neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
