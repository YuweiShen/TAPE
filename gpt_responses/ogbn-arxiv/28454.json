This involves selecting competent base detectors in a local region around a test instance using consensus of its nearest neighbors in randomly selected feature subspaces. This framework involves machine learning techniques such as clustering, feature selection, and model combination, which are commonly studied in the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data mining (cs.DM), computer vision (cs.CV), and cryptography and security (cs.CR). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
