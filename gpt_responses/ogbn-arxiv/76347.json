It also presents a sequent calculus for object-oriented actors with futures that integrates a pointer analysis and bridges the gap between behavioral types and deductive verification. These topics are closely related to programming languages (cs.PL), logic (cs.LO), software engineering (cs.SE), formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
