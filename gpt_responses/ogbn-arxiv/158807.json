This is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research, as well as in neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) more broadly. Additionally, the paper addresses the problem of inter-group communication, which is relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) and other areas where communication between different parts of a network is important."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
