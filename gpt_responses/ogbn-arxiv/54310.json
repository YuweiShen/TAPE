The paper specifically addresses the challenges of overestimation and lack of convergence guarantees in deep Q-networks. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also uses convolutional and dense layers for Q-function approximation, which suggests a possible fit with cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper deals with control and optimization problems, which could make it relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
