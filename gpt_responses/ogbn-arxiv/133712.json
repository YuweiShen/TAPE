This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.IR: The paper deals with improving a recommender system, which is a subfield of information retrieval. The authors also mention using past user interactions to infer interests, which is a common technique in information retrieval.\n- cs.LG: The paper proposes a method to dynamically adapt the system to the user's interests, which involves using machine learning techniques to update the user profile. This falls under the scope of machine learning.\n- cs.SI: The paper deals with social spatio temporal concepts, which are related to social informatics. The authors also mention using social group information to infer situations, which is a common technique in social informatics.\n- cs.HC: The paper deals with improving a recommender system, which is a subfield of human-computer interaction.
