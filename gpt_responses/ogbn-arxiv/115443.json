Therefore, cs.CV and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of deep learning algorithms (AI) and statistical analysis of image patches (MM), which are relevant to these sub-categories. Finally, the paper also discusses the use of uncontrolled settings with large pose and illumination variations, which could fall under the graphics (GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
