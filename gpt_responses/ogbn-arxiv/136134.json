The focus is on improving the accuracy of high-level vision tasks with image adaptation and boosting the perceptual quality and structural similarity of degraded images with image semantic guidance. This aligns with the scope of the Computer Vision category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed approach involves leveraging semantic information from degraded images to refine segmentation and synthesizing restored or enhanced images from semantic label maps given specific degraded exemplars. This involves the use of AI techniques and aligns with the scope of the Artificial Intelligence category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed approach involves building connections between low-level image processing and high-level computer vision tasks to achieve image restoration via segmentation refinement. This involves the use of machine learning techniques and aligns with the scope of the Machine Learning category.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with image restoration and semantic segmentation, which are important tasks in multimedia processing. This aligns with the scope of the Multimedia category.\n5. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper deals with image restoration and semantic segmentation, which are important tasks in computer graphics. This aligns with the scope of the Graphics category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
