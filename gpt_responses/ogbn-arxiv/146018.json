This is a fundamental problem in information theory, and polar codes are a popular coding technique in this field. \n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the Heegard-Berger problem, which involves source coding with side information. This is a relevant problem in social and information networks, where there is often additional information available about the data being transmitted. \n3. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper proposes a nested polar code construction to achieve the rate-distortion function for the doubly-symmetric binary sources. This involves designing efficient coding schemes, which is a relevant topic in computational complexity. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses lossy source coding, which is a relevant topic in multimedia applications where data compression is often necessary. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a nested polar lattice construction for the joint Gaussian source and side information case. This involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms for encoding and decoding, which is a relevant topic in this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
