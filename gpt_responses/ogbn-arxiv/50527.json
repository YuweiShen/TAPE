This falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS). The paper also uses entropy compression, which is a technique used in information theory (cs.IT). The paper proposes a solution that requires a small amount of space, which is related to the field of computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the size of the data structure in terms of the gap stream, which is related to cryptography (cs.CR) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
