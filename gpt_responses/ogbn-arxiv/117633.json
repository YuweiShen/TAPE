The paper proposes a novel algorithm that combines trajectory optimization and function approximation to generate trajectories online. This algorithm is designed to be easy to implement and practical, making it applicable to any robotics system. The paper also demonstrates the performance of the algorithm on the self-balanced exoskeleton Atalante. Given these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.RO (Robotics). \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques, specifically function approximation, to generate trajectories online. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nThe paper deals with a physical system, the self-balanced exoskeleton Atalante, and proposes a practical algorithm that can be implemented on real hardware. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to the sub-category cs.SY (Systems and Control). \n\nThe paper involves optimization techniques to generate trajectories offline, which is a common problem in robotics.
