This is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The method involves decomposition of binary tensors, which is related to numerical optimization (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) subfields. Finally, the experiments involve image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, which are all related to data structures (cs.DS) and computer vision (cs.CV) subfields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
