The paper focuses on the efficiency of the network in terms of computation, memory, and power. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also introduces a new convolutional module, which may fall under neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) or multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
