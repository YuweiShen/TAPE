The paper also uses techniques from computational complexity (cs.CC) to prove the NP-hardness of finding a normal coloring in certain cases. The paper also involves graph theory (cs.GT) and combinatorial geometry (cs.CG) in its proofs. Finally, the paper uses results from topology (cs.DS) to prove one of its theorems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
