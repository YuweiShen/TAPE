The use of partial evaluation and assembly is a technique that involves optimizing the execution of queries, which is also relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper proposes an algorithm for merging partial results, which is a common problem in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper deals with distributed computing, which is a subfield of computer science that focuses on the design and implementation of distributed systems (cs.Distributed). Finally, the paper proposes an optimization that involves communicating variables' candidates among sites, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
