The empirical analysis of stake shift in major cryptocurrencies involves statistical and computational methods, which are relevant to the computer science and game theory (cs.GT) sub-category. The study also involves analyzing the behavior of real-world actors, such as exchanges, which falls under the cybernetics (cs.CY) sub-category. Finally, the paper quantifies the sublinear growth of stake shift with the length of the considered lag interval, which is a topic of interest in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
