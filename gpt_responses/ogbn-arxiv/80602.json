This involves using a Mask R-CNN backbone to extract mask proposals per frame and formulating the matching between object templates and proposals as a linear assignment problem. The paper also introduces a differentiable matching layer and a refinement head to improve the quality of the matched mask. Given these details, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), multimedia (cs.MM), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
