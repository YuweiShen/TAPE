The use of expected value of a symmetric submodular value function of a set of independent random variables with given prior distributions suggests a connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The focus on team selection and online labor platforms suggests a connection to social computing (cs.SI). The use of test score algorithms suggests a connection to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the consideration of function sketching suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
