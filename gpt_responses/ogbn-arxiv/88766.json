The algorithm also involves heuristics and optimization techniques, which are common in the field of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the concept of correlation-immunity, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
