The paper provides an axiomatic characterization of multiwinner committee scoring rules, which are widely used in this context. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.GT (Computational Social Choice), which is dedicated to the study of voting and social choice mechanisms. \n\nThe paper also introduces new notions and techniques related to decision scoring rules, which are a generalization of the majority relation. This suggests that the paper could also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), which deal with decision-making and learning algorithms. \n\nFinally, the paper uses mathematical tools and concepts such as axioms, continuity, and dominance, which are typical of sub-categories such as cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Therefore, these sub-categories are also likely to be relevant to the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
