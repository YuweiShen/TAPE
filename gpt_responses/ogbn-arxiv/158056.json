This involves incorporating external knowledge into deep neural models with pseudo-relevance feedback and QA correspondence knowledge distillation. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Additionally, the paper also involves the use of deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper deals with conversation systems, which could also place it in the cs.CY (Computers and Society) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
