Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the joint embedding of visual and semantic features, which falls under the sub-category of cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper proposes models optimized for minimal complexity and state-of-the-art VQA performance, which suggests the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of VQA models, which falls under the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
