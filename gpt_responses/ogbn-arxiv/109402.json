The paper discusses the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm and demonstrates its efficiency through experiments on large-scale datasets. Based on this, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
