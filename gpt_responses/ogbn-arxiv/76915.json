The use of factor graphs and machine learning techniques to capture the interplay among different types of connotative relations suggests that this paper could also be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the proposed model against strong baselines and existing sentiment lexicons indicates that this paper could also be relevant to the sub-categories of information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
