The paper discusses the impact of noisy labels on the test accuracy of DNNs and proposes a new strategy for training DNNs robustly against noisy labels. Given the focus on deep learning and machine learning, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) applications, which are closely related to machine learning. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential security implications of noisy labels, which could fall under the sub-category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a new training strategy for DNNs, which could also fall under the sub-category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
