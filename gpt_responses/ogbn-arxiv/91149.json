This involves treating training labels as random variables and exploring their statistics. The paper extensively tests their approach on three large scale datasets, CelebA, Animals with Attributes 2, and Caltech-UCSD Birds 200, which are all related to computer vision and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper involves analyzing label assignments and their statistics, which could fall under the sub-categories of cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
