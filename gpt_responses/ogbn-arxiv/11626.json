The paper proposes a distributed algorithm for solving the MARL problem and verifies its convergence through numerical simulations. The paper also discusses case studies in practical multi-agent IoT systems. Given these aspects, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.MA (Multiagent Systems), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
