The use of pre-processing methods to enhance images also involves machine learning techniques (cs.AI) and optimization of algorithms (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper may be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories, as face detection is often used in these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
