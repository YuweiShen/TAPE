This makes the paper relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes two methods to train DeepShift models, which makes it relevant to neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. The paper also discusses the implementation of convolutional shifts and fully-connected shift GPU kernels, which makes it relevant to computer architecture (cs.AR) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new family of neural network architectures, which makes it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
