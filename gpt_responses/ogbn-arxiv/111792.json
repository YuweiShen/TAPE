The focus is on learning spatiotemporal features from raw images and pre-calculated optical flows. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it aims to develop a self-driving car system. Finally, the use of multitask learning and inductive transfer suggests that the paper may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
