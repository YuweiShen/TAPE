The paper also uses statistical mechanics and random matrix theory, which are topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The title of the paper specifically mentions MMSE (minimum mean-square error), which is a common metric in signal processing and estimation theory, suggesting that cs.MM (mathematical methods) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
