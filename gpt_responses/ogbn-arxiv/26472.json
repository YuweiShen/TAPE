The paper also discusses the use of linear function approximation, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The algorithm's stability and convergence properties are also discussed, which are important topics in control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of state-dependent discounting and bootstrapping, which are common techniques in neural networks (cs.NE) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
