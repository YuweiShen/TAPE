The paper focuses on the theoretical justification of limiting the network size within finite bounds for optimization, which is a common problem in machine learning and neural networks. Therefore, cs.LG and cs.NE are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.AI, cs.CV, and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
