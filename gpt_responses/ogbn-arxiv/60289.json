The paper also mentions the use of deep neural networks, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of visual descriptors, which is a common topic in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper mentions the use of synthetic image transformations, which is a common technique in robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
