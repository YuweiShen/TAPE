This involves optimizing the spatial symbol detector and deriving closed form expressions for the detection threshold at different SNR regions, which are typical topics in information theory. \n2. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper deals with a massive MIMO single user transmission system operating in the millimeter wave outdoor narrowband channel environment. This involves communication and networking aspects such as channel modeling, modulation, and transmission techniques. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a system architecture that reduces power consumption while maintaining performance, which involves system design and control aspects. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with a transmission system that aims to maintain high spectral efficiency and low bit error rate, which are important for multimedia applications. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a transmission system that operates in the millimeter wave outdoor narrowband channel environment, which is relevant to networking and internet architecture aspects such as wireless communication and network protocols."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
