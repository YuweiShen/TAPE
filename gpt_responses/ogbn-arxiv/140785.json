The paper specifically addresses pool-based sequential active learning for regression, which falls under the category of supervised learning. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the selection of informative, representative, and diverse samples, which are important considerations in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also conducts experiments on various datasets, which suggests a focus on data science (cs.DS) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
