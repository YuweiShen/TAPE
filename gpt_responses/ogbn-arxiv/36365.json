The paper focuses on the application of this framework to two specific dynamical systems, namely, heat convection-diffusion system and fluid dynamical system. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.SY (Systems and Control), which deals with the analysis, design, and control of dynamical systems. \n\nThe paper also extensively uses deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional LSTM, to predict the time-varying evolution of external forces/perturbations. Therefore, the paper could also be classified under cs.LG (Machine Learning), which deals with the development and application of machine learning algorithms. \n\nThe paper also uses a neuro-inspired algorithm, Cellular Neural Network, to model dynamical systems defined by coupled partial differential equations. This could classify the paper under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), which deals with the development and application of neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. \n\nThe paper also uses convolutional operations extensively, which could classify the paper under cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), which deals with the development and application of computer vision algorithms. \n\nFinally, the paper deals with the prediction of spatiotemporal evolution of dynamical systems, which could classify the paper under cs"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
