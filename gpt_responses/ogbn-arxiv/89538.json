This involves learning an embedding of the polynomials and guiding the choice of inference rules using deep reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as the paper deals with developing a learning-based algorithm for a computational task. The paper also involves mathematical optimization and symbolic computation, which are covered by sub-categories cs.SC (Symbolic Computation) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
