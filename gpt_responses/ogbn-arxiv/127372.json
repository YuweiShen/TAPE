This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under Machine Learning. \n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the use of the Path Integral optimal control algorithm for planning in continuous control tasks. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under Robotics. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper introduces a recurrent network representation of the Path Integral optimal control algorithm, which includes both system dynamics and cost models. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under Systems and Control. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of imitation and reinforcement learning for learning schemes. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under Artificial Intelligence. \n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper introduces a recurrent network representation of the Path Integral optimal control algorithm, which is fully differentiable and learns both dynamics and cost models end-to-end.
