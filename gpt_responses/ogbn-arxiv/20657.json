The proposed method involves discretizing bounding boxes, which is a technique that can be applied to various object detection tasks (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of deep learning frameworks such as Mask R-CNN, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The experiments involve benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
