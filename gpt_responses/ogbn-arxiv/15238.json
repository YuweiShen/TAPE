Therefore, cs.CV and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a neural network-based model and formulates a training objective, which are related to machine learning (LG) and multimedia (MM). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a graph-based search procedure, which is a common technique in neural networks (NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
