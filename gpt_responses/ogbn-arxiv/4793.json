The paper also proposes an optimization method using stochastic gradient descent, which is a common technique in machine learning (ML) and optimization (LG). The paper uses image retrieval benchmarks, which is a common application in multimedia (MM). Finally, the paper addresses the challenge of binary codes for indexed data, which is a common problem in data structures (DS).
