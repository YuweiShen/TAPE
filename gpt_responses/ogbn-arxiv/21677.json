Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes an online optimization framework, which involves designing algorithms and models to optimize the tracking process. This makes cs.RO (Robotics) a likely sub-category as well. Additionally, the paper involves designing a novel pose flow non maximum suppression (NMS) algorithm, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also involves designing an efficient and robust pose tracker, which involves machine learning and optimization techniques, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper involves extensive experiments and evaluation of the proposed method, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
