The use of small-bias spaces to derandomize the mild pseudorandom restrictions is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). The construction of pseudorandom generators for combinatorial rectangles and read-once CNFs involves combinatorial structures (cs.DS). Finally, the use of pseudorandom restrictions to prove circuit lower bounds is a topic in computational geometry and topology (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
