The use of deep neural networks also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The proposed method involves detecting cracks on pavement surfaces, which could fall under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper also deals with the issue of road safety, which could make it relevant to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
