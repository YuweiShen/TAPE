The most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) since the paper proposes an algorithm for summarizing large graphs. The paper also discusses how to efficiently retrieve similar graphs from a database, which suggests that it could be categorized under cs.DB (Databases). The use of the Regularity Lemma, a well-known result in graph theory, could place the paper under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the evaluation of the noise robustness of the approach could also make it relevant to cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
