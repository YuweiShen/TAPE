The paper also deals with the security of a public key cryptosystem (cs.CR) and involves algorithms and heuristics (cs.DM) for solving equations in the group. The use of a length function in the algorithms suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT), and the application of the method to a specific group suggests a connection to systems and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
