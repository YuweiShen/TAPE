The paper also involves the use of multiplication and modulo operations, which are common in information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the sampling function using C-code, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
