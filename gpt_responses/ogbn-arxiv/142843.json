This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the use of a UAV as a mobile relay to assist communication between two ground users without a direct link. This is a networking problem that falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper proposes a novel protocol for UAV-enabled relaying that involves optimizing the UAV trajectory. This falls under the domain of robotics.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the optimization of a UAV-enabled communication system, which involves controlling the UAV trajectory and transmit power.
