The authors propose a Deep Q-Network (DQN) approach based on reinforcement learning to address the challenges of unknown system dynamics and large state space. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) categories. Additionally, the paper formulates the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and proposes an adaptive DQN approach, which indicates that it may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Information Theory (cs.IT) categories. Finally, the paper uses simulations and real-data trace to compare the performance of DQN with other policies, which suggests that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
