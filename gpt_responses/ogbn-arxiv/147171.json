The use of dynamic programming and approximation algorithms suggests a connection to algorithms and complexity (cs.DM) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper presents results for several families of point sequences, which could also place it in the machine learning (cs.LG) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
