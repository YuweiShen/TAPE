The paper also discusses the relationship between CGS-SPC and other types of games, such as iterated boolean games and influence games. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the verification problem for specifications in Alternating-time Temporal Logic on CGS-SPC, which is a common topic in AI research. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper introduces a new type of game structure and discusses its relationship with Linear Temporal Logic. The paper also discusses the verification problem for specifications in Alternating-time Temporal Logic. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the computational complexity of the verification problem for specifications in Alternating-time Temporal Logic on CGS-SPC, which is a common topic in algorithmic game theory. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the reduction of CGS-SPC to concurrent game structures with exclusive control, which is a common topic in programming language semantics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
