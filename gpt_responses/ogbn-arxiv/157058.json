The construction is based on a hierarchical net-tree, which is a data structure commonly used in computational geometry and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the persistence diagram, which is a tool in topological data analysis (cs.DM). The construction of the filtration is done in a computationally efficient manner, which falls under the category of algorithms and complexity (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of the filtration for large data sets, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
