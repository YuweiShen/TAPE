The paper proposes a new method called Stein variational policy gradient (SVPG) which combines existing policy gradient methods and a repulsive functional to generate a set of diverse but well-behaved policies. This work is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision) as these sub-categories are closely related to the topic of reinforcement learning and policy optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
