The paper also discusses concentration inequalities, which are often studied in the sub-category of cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper deals with smooth H\\\"older class of densities, which is a topic of interest in the sub-category of cs.ST (Statistics). The paper also presents a numerical experiment, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
