The paper also proposes two fusion approaches that leverage the VoxelNet architecture, which involves deep learning techniques and could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method using the KITTI dataset, which involves natural language processing techniques for annotation and could be categorized under computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
