The use of message-decay arguments and spatial mixing also suggests a connection to information theory and statistical physics, which are also relevant sub-fields of CS. The specific focus on anti-ferromagnetic spin systems and bounded degree graphs may suggest a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) or computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of approximation schemes may also suggest a connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG), while the use of spatial mixing may suggest a connection to social networks and network analysis (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
