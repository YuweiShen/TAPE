This problem is related to string matching and information theory, which suggests that cs.DS and cs.IT are likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of compressed data structures, which is a topic in cs.DM. The authors mention the use of techniques such as hashing and bit-parallelism, which are common in computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper involves optimization of space and time complexity, which is a topic in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
