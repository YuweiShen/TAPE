Information theory is concerned with the transmission, processing, and utilization of information, and the paper deals with the detection of information in an SM system. \n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): SM is a MIMO technique used in wireless communication systems, and the paper proposes a low-complexity detection scheme for SM systems. Therefore, cs.COMM is a likely sub-category for this paper. \n3. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper proposes a novel hard-limiting enabled sphere decoding detector for SM systems, which involves signal processing techniques. Therefore, cs.SI is a likely sub-category for this paper. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a MIMO technique used in wireless communication systems, which is a networking and internet architecture-related topic. Therefore, cs.NI is a possible sub-category for this paper. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a low-complexity detection scheme for SM systems, which involves the use of Sphere Decoding (SD) algorithms. Therefore, cs.DS is a possible sub-category for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
