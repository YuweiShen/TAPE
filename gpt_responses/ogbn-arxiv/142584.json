Specifically, the paper focuses on quantum and classical ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs), which are used to represent Boolean functions. Therefore, cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are both likely sub-categories. Additionally, since the paper deals with quantum OBDDs and presents a new method for constructing them, cs.QL (Quantum Physics) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of reordering to construct new functions, which could fall under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Finally, the paper mentions the use of probabilistic OBDDs, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
