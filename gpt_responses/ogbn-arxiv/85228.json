The algorithm uses a monocular camera and a 6-axis IMU, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The paper also discusses the observability mismatch issue, which is related to control systems (cs.SY), and proposes a solution that does not require additional sensors, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
