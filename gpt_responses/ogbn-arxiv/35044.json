It also discusses the use of these specifications in verified compilers and sound program analysis, which could be classified under software engineering (cs.SE) and formal methods (cs.FL). The paper introduces a new approach to developing concrete and abstract semantics, which involves defining a general notion of interpretation, which could be classified under logic in computer science (cs.LO). Finally, the paper discusses consistency results between interpretations, which could be classified under cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
