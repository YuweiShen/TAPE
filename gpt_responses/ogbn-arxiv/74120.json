The method involves generating local explanations and counterfactuals, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning interpretability (cs.LG). The paper also introduces a definition of fidelity for local explanation models, which is a concept relevant to computer engineering (cs.CE). The evaluation of the proposed method involves comparing it to a popular existing method, which is a common approach in computer science research (cs.CR). Finally, the paper's case studies involve image classification, which is a common application of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
