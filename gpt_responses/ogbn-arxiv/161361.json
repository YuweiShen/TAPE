The paper also discusses the use of privileged information and attention mechanisms, which are common topics in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper addresses the challenges of physical constraints and safety, which are relevant to the field of robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
