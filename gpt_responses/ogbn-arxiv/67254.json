It also involves transfer learning, which is a common technique in computer vision. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it proposes an algorithm that learns the difference between classification and detection tasks and transfers this knowledge to classifiers. \n\nArtificial intelligence (cs.AI) is another likely sub-category as the paper deals with developing algorithms that can enable detection for categories that lack bounding box annotations. \n\nNatural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM) are less likely sub-categories, but they cannot be completely ruled out as the paper involves processing large quantities of image-level labels and evaluating the efficacy of the proposed algorithm on the ImageNet LSVRC-2013 detection challenge."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
