The paper focuses on the computational efficiency of the method and presents simulation results to demonstrate its speed and accuracy. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM). The method also involves solving least-squares problems and using the QR decomposition, which are common techniques in information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
