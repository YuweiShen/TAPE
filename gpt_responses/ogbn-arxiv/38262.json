Additionally, the paper discusses benchmark tasks and learning-based methods, which are relevant to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The use of hardware-safety metrics and the mention of training hours registered on the robots suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. Finally, the mention of task videos suggests that the paper may have some relevance to the cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
