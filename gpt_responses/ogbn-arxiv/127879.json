The use of submodular functions and stochastic optimization suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The introduction of a new optimization problem and its reduction from another problem suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
