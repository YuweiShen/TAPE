This involves object detection and classification, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the security implications of the system, which could fall under the computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of deep learning models for automated detection also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the potential impact on airport security and the role of Transportation Security Officers suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
