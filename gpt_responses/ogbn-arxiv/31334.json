The use of variational methods is also a common technique in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the autoregressive moving average noise spectrum, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI). The iterative refinement of the receiver's knowledge is a common technique in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.MM).
