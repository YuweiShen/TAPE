The paper proposes a few-shot NLG approach that utilizes a pre-trained language model and content selection/copying from input data. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related areas. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, such as few-shot learning and language modeling, which are covered by cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with information retrieval and summarization, which are related to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing, Semantic Web)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
