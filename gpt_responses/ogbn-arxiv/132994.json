This involves optimizing the direct current (DC)-bias value at each access-point (AP) and the users' powers. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses a cooperative VLC network where multiple APs serve both energy-harvesting users (EHUs) and IUs. The paper proposes an algorithm to jointly balance the achievable sum-rate at the IUs and the energy harvested by the EHUs, subject to individual EHU harvested-energy constraint and AP power constraints. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an iterative approach to solve a non-convex optimization problem, which involves inner convex approximations and outer-loop updates. This approach is used to jointly determine the DC-bias value at each AP and the users' powers. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with VLC networks, which are used for high data rate communication. The paper proposes an algorithm to jointly balance the achievable sum-rate at the IUs and the energy harvested by the EHUs, subject to individual EHU harvested-energy constraint and AP power constraints. \n5. cs.PE (Performance): The"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
