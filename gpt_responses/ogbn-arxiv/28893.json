This falls under the domain of computer architecture.\n- cs.PF (Performance): The paper focuses on developing analytical performance models for NoCs with multiple priority traffic classes to accurately estimate end-to-end latency. This falls under the domain of performance analysis.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a systematic approach to decompose the given NoC into individual queues with modified service time to enable accurate and scalable latency computations. This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper focuses on NoCs, which are used in distributed and parallel computing systems. The proposed approach aims to improve the performance of evaluation frameworks, which are used to explore the design space of such systems.\n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): NoCs are an emerging technology that has become the standard for interconnect solutions in industrial designs ranging from client CPUs to many-core chip-multiprocessors. The proposed approach aims to improve the performance and power consumption of such systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
