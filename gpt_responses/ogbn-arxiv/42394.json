It also involves the adaptation of hyperparameters throughout evolution, which is a common technique in machine learning. Additionally, the paper may also fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) due to the use of evolutionary computation methods. The sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE) may also be relevant as the paper discusses the development of a pipeline for AutoML. Finally, the sub-category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) may be relevant as the paper may involve the use of parallel computing to speed up the evolutionary process."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
