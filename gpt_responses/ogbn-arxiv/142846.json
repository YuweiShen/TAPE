The paper proposes a new regularization technique that can be integrated into an arbitrary network, which suggests that it could be relevant to a wide range of subfields in computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
