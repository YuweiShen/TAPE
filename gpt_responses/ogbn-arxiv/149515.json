Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), followed by cs.DB (Databases), as the paper deals with data management and privacy concerns. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.CY (Computers and Society).
