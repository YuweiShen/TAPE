The proposed method involves using reward-based training to refine the translation quality, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The model also involves deliberation and learning policies, which are techniques commonly used in reinforcement learning (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the model using discourse metrics, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
