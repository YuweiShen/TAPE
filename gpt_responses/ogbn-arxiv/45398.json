The paper proposes a one-pass learning approach that can handle incremental and decremental features without storing the whole data. This problem is closely related to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), data structures (cs.DS), and information retrieval (cs.IR). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
