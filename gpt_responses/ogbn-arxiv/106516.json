Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a multi-style abstractive summarization model, which involves learning multi-style answers within a model, indicating a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also evaluates its model's performance on the Q&A task and the Q&A + NLG task of MS MARCO 2.1, which are information retrieval (cs.IR) tasks. Finally, the paper discusses the transfer of the style-independent NLG capability to the target style, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
