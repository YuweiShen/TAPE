The use of a softmax layer and temperature values suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL), where these techniques are commonly used. The paper's focus on learning embeddings for samples also suggests relevance to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the mention of achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
