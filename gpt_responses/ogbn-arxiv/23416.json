The paper proposes a two-stage generation framework that involves training networks to learn residual motion between current and future frames, which is a machine learning approach (cs.LG). The paper also leverages temporal knowledge from the training data, which involves using artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI). The experiments conducted involve facial expression retargeting and human pose forecasting, which are both tasks related to multimedia (cs.MM) and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
