The paper also discusses the use of entropy and geometric considerations in the construction of these distances, which are relevant to the sub-categories of cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper applies these distances to tasks such as density estimation, generative modeling, and mixture simplification, which are commonly found in the sub-categories of cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.ST (Statistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
