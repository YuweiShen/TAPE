The paper also deals with various types of power constraints and channel state information conditions, which are relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and systems and control (cs.SY). The optimization techniques used in the paper involve linear algebra and optimization theory, which are relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
