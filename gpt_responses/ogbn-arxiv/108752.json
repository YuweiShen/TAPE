The paper also discusses the need to preserve functional requirements while accommodating variations in non-functional requirements (NFRs), which is a common concern in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper proposes a formal method for analysing conformance to NFRs, which involves partial satisfaction of requirements, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
