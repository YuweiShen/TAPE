It also uses the theoretical notion of Kolmogorov complexity, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper discusses the extension of information distance from pairs to multiples, which involves studying maximal overlap, metricity, universality, minimal overlap, additivity, and normalized information distance. These concepts are relevant to data structures (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and cryptography (cs.CR). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT, followed by cs.DS, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
