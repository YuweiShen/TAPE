The paper focuses on the development of a customized FCN with residual connections to address the challenges of WMH segmentation, such as inhomogeneous MRI intensities, random location and size distributions, and MRI noise. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
