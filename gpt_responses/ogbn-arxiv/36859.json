The paper also discusses the use of sparse graph representations in the design of the hash table, which is a topic that falls under the category of data structures and algorithms. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of hash tables in big data applications, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of cs.DB (Databases). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of GPUs in the implementation of the hash table, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). \n\nThe paper also discusses the performance of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art hash table implementations, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Finally, the paper discusses the use of a new probing algorithm for value lookups, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-category of cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
