The paper specifically focuses on the stability of these algorithms with nonlinear function approximation, which falls under the category of machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
