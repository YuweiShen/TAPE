The proposed approach involves efficient implementations and extensive experiments, which are typical of machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR) research. The problem of matching consecutive subpatterns is also relevant to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
