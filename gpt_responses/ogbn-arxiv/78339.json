The paper proposes a new approach to coreference resolution, which combines the strengths of two existing models and improves them via two extensions. This suggests that the paper belongs to the sub-category of NLP and machine learning. Specifically, the paper involves techniques such as ranking, clustering, and lexicalization, which are commonly used in NLP and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves information retrieval (IR) techniques such as ranking, which suggests that cs.IR (Information Retrieval) could also be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper involves neural networks (NE) as a key component of the proposed approach, which suggests that cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
