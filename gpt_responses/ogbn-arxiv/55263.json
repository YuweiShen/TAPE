This involves optimizing an objective function that directly minimizes catastrophic interference. The paper also discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method in the context of neural network function approximators, which are commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
