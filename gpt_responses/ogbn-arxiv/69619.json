The approach involves the use of a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) for segmenting the images into the classes \"inflorescence\" and \"non-inflorescence\" and extracting individual flowers from the \"inflorescence\"-areas using Circular Hough Transform. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper deals with the development of an automated image-based workflow for quantifying inflorescences and single flowers in unprepared field images of grapevines, which involves the use of a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) for image segmentation. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper may be relevant to the field of information retrieval as it deals with the development of a non-invasive, inexpensive and objective phenotyping approach for predicting yield potential in grapevines, which could be useful for monitoring and evaluating breeding material, genetic repositories or commercial vineyards. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves the use of a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) for image segmentation, which is a type of deep learning model used for pixel-wise classification tasks.
