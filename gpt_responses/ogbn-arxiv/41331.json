The use of multiple antennas at each terminal also suggests the possibility of exploring signal processing (cs.SI) and communication theory (cs.COMM). Finally, the large-system analysis method used in the paper is a technique commonly used in machine learning and optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
