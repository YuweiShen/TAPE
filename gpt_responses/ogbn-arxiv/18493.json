The use of wavelet trees suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the areas of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and computational complexity (cs.CC), which often involve the study of combinatorial structures and their properties. Finally, the paper mentions applications to document listing and coloured range reporting, which are tasks commonly encountered in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
