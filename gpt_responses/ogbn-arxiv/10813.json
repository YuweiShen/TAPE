This is a key area of research in social and information networks. \n2. cs.SOC (Social and Economic Networks) - The paper's focus on interference in networks and its impact on A/B testing is also relevant to the study of social and economic networks. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper uses statistical methods and central limit theorems to analyze the power of A/B testing under interference. This is a key area of research in data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper's focus on quantifying the power of A/B testing as a function of the number of exposed individuals is related to information theory. \n5. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) - The paper's focus on interference and its impact on A/B testing is relevant to the study of multiagent systems, where agents may interact and interfere with each other's actions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
