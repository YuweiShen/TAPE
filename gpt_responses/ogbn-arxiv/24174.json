The use of posted pricing also suggests a connection to mechanism design (cs.DS). The sequential arrival of buyers and the Bayesian setting suggest a connection to auctions and mechanism design (cs.MA). The focus on approximation factors and buyer valuations suggests a connection to algorithmic game theory (cs.EC). Finally, the use of convex production costs and the extension to settings where the seller is oblivious to buyer valuations suggest a connection to optimization and decision making (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
