The approach proposed in the paper involves training specialized object boundary detectors for different situations, which is a form of context-awareness. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of machine learning techniques to train the specialized detectors also suggests that the paper may be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The experiments conducted on large datasets such as ImageNet and Microsoft COCO suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of global image appearance to model context suggests that the paper may be relevant to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
