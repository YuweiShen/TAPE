The paper discusses several sub-classes of mean-payoff games and their properties, including undecidability and determinacy under a more general notion of winning strategy. These topics are closely related to game theory (cs.GT), logic (cs.LO), and algorithms (cs.DS, cs.AI, cs.CC). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.GT, cs.LO, cs.DS, cs.AI, and cs.CC, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
