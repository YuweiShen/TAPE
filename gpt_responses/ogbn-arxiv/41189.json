The use of and-or trees and circuits suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the problem of deciding the existence of succinct models can be seen as a combinatorial optimization problem, which is often studied in the discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
