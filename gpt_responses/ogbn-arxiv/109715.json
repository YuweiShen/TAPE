This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of wireless sensor networks to monitor noise levels in smart-city environments. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n- cs.SD (Sound): The paper focuses on the acquisition of audio data in smart-city environments and the reduction of noise pollution. This falls under the scope of sound.\n- cs.ET (Embedded Systems): The paper presents a design for a low-power smart microphone system that uses a microcontroller and an ADC to dynamically switch between high and low power modes. This falls under the scope of embedded systems.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of audio data in smart-city environments and the potential benefits of reducing noise pollution. This falls under the scope of multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
