The paper also discusses the problem of vanishing gradients, which is a common issue in neural networks and falls under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper presents empirical results and discusses the learning capacity of the proposed technique, which is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
