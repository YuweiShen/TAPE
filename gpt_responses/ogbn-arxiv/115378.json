Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves algebraic structures and polynomials, which suggests cs.GT (Discrete Mathematics) as another likely sub-category. The paper also involves lower bounds and optimization, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper's applications in consumer electronics and communication systems suggest cs.SI (Signal and Image Processing) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
