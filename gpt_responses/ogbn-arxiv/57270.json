The use of mixed-integer linear constraints to define non-transferable utility games is a mathematical optimization problem, which suggests the paper could be categorized under cs.GT (Game Theory). The paper also discusses solution concepts for these games, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). The analysis of computational complexity could also place the paper under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
