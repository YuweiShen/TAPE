The abstract mentions that the paper considers the problem of search by robots, and proposes a coordination strategy based on cellular decomposition. \n2. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper deals with the problem of coordination among multiple self-interested robots without a priori knowledge about each other. The abstract mentions that the robots have restricted communication capacity, and proposes a coordination strategy to mitigate interference. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a coordination strategy for multiple robots to search an environment without a priori information. The abstract mentions that the proposed strategy is based on the concept of soft obstacles, which suggests the use of AI techniques to reason about the environment. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the problem of coordinating multiple robots to search an environment, which can be seen as a control problem. The abstract mentions that the proposed strategy is based on cellular decomposition, which is a technique commonly used in control theory. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a coordination strategy for multiple robots to search an environment, which involves reasoning about the structure of the environment. The abstract mentions that the proposed strategy is based on cellular decomposition, which"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
