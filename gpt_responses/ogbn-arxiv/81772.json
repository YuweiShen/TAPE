The method involves backpropagating activation differences, which is a technique used in neural network training (cs.NE). The authors apply their method to models trained on image data (MNIST) and simulated genomic data, which suggests that the paper could also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and computational biology (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
