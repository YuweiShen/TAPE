Computer Vision (cs.CV) is also a likely sub-category as the system uses vision and LiDAR data for localization. Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) are also possible sub-categories as the system uses semantic data and key-point based visual localization approach. Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) is less likely as there is no mention of language processing in the abstract."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
