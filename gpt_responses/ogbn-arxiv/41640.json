The use of classifications and the study of two well-studied notions of optimality (popularity and rank-maximality) suggest that the paper belongs to the sub-categories of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
