This involves addressing challenges related to data security, verification, and management, which are relevant to several computer science sub-categories. Specifically, the paper discusses the use of smart contracts and open provenance model (OPM) to record immutable data trails, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.DB (Databases), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of blockchain as a platform for building distributed reliable applications, which is relevant to sub-categories such as cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.DL (Digital Libraries)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
