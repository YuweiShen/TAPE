The use of space-filling curves is a well-known technique in computational geometry (cs.CG) and the paper specifically mentions the Gray-Hilbert curve, which is a popular choice in this field. The paper also discusses the handling of higher dimensional data, which is relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
