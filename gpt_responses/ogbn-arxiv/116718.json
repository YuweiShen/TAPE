The paper also discusses the use of specialized layers in the CNN for facial alignment, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper evaluates its model on face verification benchmarks, which is a common task in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the robustness of the CNN model, which is a common topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
