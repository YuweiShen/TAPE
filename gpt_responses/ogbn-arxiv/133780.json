The proposed method also involves similarity-based clustering, which is a common technique in machine learning and data mining (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper uses experimental results to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, which suggests that it could also be relevant to the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
