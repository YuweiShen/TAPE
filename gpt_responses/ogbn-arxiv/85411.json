The paper presents new techniques for solving various distance problems, including all-pairs shortest paths, multi-source shortest paths, and diameter approximation. These problems are fundamental in computer science and are studied in various subfields such as algorithms, data structures, computational geometry, network algorithms, and distributed computing. Therefore, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.NE (Networks and Internet Architecture), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
