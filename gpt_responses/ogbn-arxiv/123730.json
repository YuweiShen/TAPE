The paper proposes a novel estimator that uses polynomial approximation to trade-off bias and variance, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the fundamental trade-offs involved in the accuracy of estimated privacy guarantees and the number of samples required, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). The paper uses mathematical analysis to prove the minimax optimality of the proposed estimator, which is a common technique in theoretical computer science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the effective sample size amplification phenomenon, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
