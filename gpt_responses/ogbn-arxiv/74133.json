Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the joint training of feature extractor and tracking process, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of CNNs for tracking also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments are performed on tracking datasets, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the real-time performance of the proposed method, which is related to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
