The use of Grassmannian manifolds and set-metrics also suggests a connection to topics in geometric deep learning and information theory (cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.IT). Additionally, the application of the proposed metrics to EEG signals for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) suggests a connection to signal processing and numerical analysis (cs.NA, cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
