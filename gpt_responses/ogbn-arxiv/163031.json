The paper also discusses MIMO antenna selection and capacity decomposition, which are topics related to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper provides results on network simplification, which can be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
