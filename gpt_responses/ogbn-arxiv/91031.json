The tool also involves a user evaluation, which falls under the category of human-computer interaction (cs.HC) or software engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the use of OWL axioms suggests a connection to databases (cs.DB) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
