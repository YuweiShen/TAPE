The paper also mentions the infamous case of Google Photos' racist image recognition algorithm, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper proposes a mixed-integer programming framework for classification, which involves optimization and decision-making, indicating the relevance to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions the extension of the framework to cost-sensitive settings, which involves security and privacy (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
