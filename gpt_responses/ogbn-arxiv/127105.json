The use of graph fractional covers to decompose the dependency graph is a technique from information theory (cs.IT) and graph theory (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the application of the bounds to ranking statistics (cs.AI) and stationary mixing processes (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
