The proposed obfuscation mechanism involves optimization models and building blocks, which are commonly used in the fields of machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper evaluates the obfuscation on real energy and transportation networks, which suggests that it may also fall under the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
