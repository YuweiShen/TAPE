This indicates a strong connection to robotics. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The quadrotor position controller is a control system, and the paper discusses the efficiency and lightweight nature of the trained policy, which is relevant to systems and control. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although not a major focus of the paper, the quadrotor experiments involve tracking along a specific trajectory, which could potentially involve computer vision techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
