The proposed solution involves using Quality of Information (QoI) as the decision factor for broadcasting, which is a concept related to system optimization and control. The paper also discusses congestion control mechanisms, which are related to computer networks and security. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
