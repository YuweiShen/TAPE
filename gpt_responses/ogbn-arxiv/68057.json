The paper discusses the signal model, receiver and transmitter of the PSMA method, and evaluates its performance in a heterogeneous cellular network. The paper also compares PSMA with other multiple access techniques from the performance and computational complexity perspective. Given the focus on wireless communication and network optimization, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
