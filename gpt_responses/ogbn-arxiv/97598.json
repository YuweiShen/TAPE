It proposes a new interpretation of the stochastic gradient of vanilla SGD as a matrix-vector product of the matrix of gradients and a random noise vector, which leads to the development of Multiplicative SGD (M-SGD). The paper also discusses the convergence of M-SGD to a continuous stochastic differential equation and its potential applications in solving practical deep learning problems. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
