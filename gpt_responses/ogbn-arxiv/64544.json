This involves using Gaussian mixture prior models (GMM) for the source signal and treating the NMF decomposition weight matrices as a distorted image by a distortion operator, which is learned directly from the observed signals. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including:\n\n- cs.SD (Sound): The paper focuses on source separation, which is a common problem in audio processing. The use of GMM priors and log-normal distribution for the distortion also suggests a focus on sound-related applications.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a regularized NMF algorithm with MMSE estimates, which involves optimization and learning. This suggests a focus on machine learning techniques.\n- cs.SI (Signal and Image Processing): The paper treats the NMF decomposition weight matrices as a distorted image, which suggests a focus on signal and image processing techniques.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The use of MMSE estimates and GMM priors suggests a focus on information theory and statistical signal processing.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): While the paper does not explicitly mention neural networks or evolutionary computing, the use of regularization and learning suggests a potential overlap with this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
