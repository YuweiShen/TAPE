This suggests that cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also describes algorithms and complexity analysis, indicating that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The use of Voronoi cells and distance duality suggests a connection to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) as well. Finally, the paper mentions the simplex method and first-order methods, which are commonly used in optimization problems, indicating a possible connection to cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
