It also involves the use of simulation tools such as SUMO, which falls under the categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics and Control). Additionally, the paper deals with network optimization and traffic flow, which could be classified under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
