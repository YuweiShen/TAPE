This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking) - The paper proposes a new code construction method for MC-CDMA system to support a large number of users with low PMEPR. This is relevant to the field of communication and networking.\n3. cs.SI (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with the design and optimization of a system (MC-CDMA) using complementary codes. This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper proposes a new code construction method for MC-CDMA system, which is relevant to the field of networking and internet architecture.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a direct construction method for generating ZCCS for MC-CDMA system, which involves the use of Boolean functions. This falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
