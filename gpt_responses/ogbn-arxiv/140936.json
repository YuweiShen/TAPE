This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the partitioning of D2D users into multiple groups, which can be seen as a clustering problem (cs.SI). The proposed framework involves careful selection of transmitters within each multicasting group, which can be viewed as an optimization problem (cs.DC). Finally, the paper presents a new design framework for D2D caching schemes, which can be seen as a contribution to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
