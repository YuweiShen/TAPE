Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also introduces a new recurrent physical cell (PhyCell) for performing PDE-constrained prediction, which could fall under neural networks (cs.NE) or systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
