This involves the integration of distributed energy resources, which is a complex and dynamic system. The paper proposes a taxonomy of control strategies and formal design criteria to assist in the design and evaluation of such systems. This work involves the application of control theory, artificial intelligence, software engineering, and cybernetics, which are all relevant to the sub-categories of cs.SY, cs.AI, cs.SE, cs.ET, and cs.CY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
