This makes it likely to belong to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) category, which deals with computer security and privacy. Additionally, the paper discusses the technical aspects of machine learning, such as perturbation and model stealing, which suggests it could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) categories. The paper also touches on the societal implications of adversarial machine learning, which could place it in the cs.CY (Computers and Society) category. Finally, the paper discusses the need for ML systems to be designed with forensics in mind, which could place it in the cs.SE (Software Engineering) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
