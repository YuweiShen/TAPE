The paper also proposes a method for representing multi-modal densities using Gaussian mixture models, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of this method in computer vision applications (cs.CV) and the performance is evaluated on benchmarks commonly used in neural network research (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
