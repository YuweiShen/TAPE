It also involves learning to combine multi-level feature maps, which is a common technique in computer vision. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories as it involves training a neural network to predict saliency maps. The Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper involves training a neural network. Finally, the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper deals with image analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
