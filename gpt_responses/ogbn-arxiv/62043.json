The use of Wong sequences suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The focus on matrix rank and determinant also suggests connections to data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), and scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
