The paper also mentions the use of algorithms for merging states and removing transitions, which are common techniques in logic and set theory (cs.LO). The implementation of the algorithm on a library for tree automata (libvata) suggests a focus on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), while the exploration of how the algorithm can improve hard operations like complementation suggests a focus on programming languages and compilers (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
