The authors propose the use of deep learning models, specifically recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to classify JavaScript and VBScript files as either malicious or benign. This involves processing the byte sequences of these scripts, which is a task that can benefit from the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The models are trained in an end-to-end fashion, which involves optimizing the parameters of the RNNs using backpropagation, a technique that is commonly used in software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the authors evaluate their models on large datasets of JavaScript and VBScript files, which involves measuring their performance in terms of true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR), a task that can benefit from the use of statistical methods (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
