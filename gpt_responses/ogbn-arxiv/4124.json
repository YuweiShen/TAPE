It may also belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) as it presents a new algorithm for efficiently processing big sound archives using distributed computing technologies. Additionally, the use of machine learning algorithms suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.DB (Databases). Finally, the project summary results suggest that it could belong to cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) as it is being used for exploring marine mammal acoustics for big data applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
