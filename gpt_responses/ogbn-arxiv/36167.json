The paper also discusses the computational model of the feedforward path of the primate visual cortex, which could be categorized under neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The analysis of the networks' performance and the effect of different factors on crowding could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
