The use of fully convolutional networks and recurrent networks for feature representation and temporal modeling suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of deep learning techniques also suggests that the paper could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The focus on urban change detection suggests that the paper could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the evaluation of the developed models suggests that the paper could belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
