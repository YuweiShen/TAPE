This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. Additionally, the paper deals with vehicle localization, which falls under the robotics (cs.RO) category. The use of ensemble learning and knowledge distillation also suggests the paper could be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper uses experimental results to validate the proposed approach, which could also fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
