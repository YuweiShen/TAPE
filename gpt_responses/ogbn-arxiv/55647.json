This is a core topic in game theory. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the complexity of finding equilibria in these games and identifies classes of graphs for which equilibria can be found in polynomial time. This involves algorithmic analysis and complexity theory. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper studies games on network topologies that are commonly used in communication networks, such as token ring local area networks and Ethernet ring protection switching. This is relevant to the study of social and information networks. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses network topologies and their relevance to the coordination games studied. This is relevant to the study of networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses equilibria in strategic games, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
