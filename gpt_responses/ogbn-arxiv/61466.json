The visual features used in the paper are based on HOG, SIFT, and CNN, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also uses BoAW representation of LLDs for audio features, which falls under the domain of speech and audio processing (cs.SD). The paper also involves training fully connected neural network regression models, which falls under the domain of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with emotion recognition, which can be considered a sub-domain of affective computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
