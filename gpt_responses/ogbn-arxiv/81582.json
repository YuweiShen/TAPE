The use of deep learning models for classification also suggests that the paper could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper investigates the importance of stain normalization, which is a common preprocessing step in image analysis (cs.IR). Finally, the paper reports the performance of the proposed system on an independent dataset, which could suggest that the paper also belongs to the computer science sub-category of data analysis and statistics (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
