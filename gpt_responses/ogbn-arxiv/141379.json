Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper involves software engineering concepts such as dynamic taint analysis and program analysis, which makes cs.SE (Software Engineering) another likely sub-category. The paper also introduces a novel approach for approximating gradients over discontinuous operations, which falls under the category of programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). The use of neural networks and mathematical rigor in the proposed approach also suggests the possibility of the paper being categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
