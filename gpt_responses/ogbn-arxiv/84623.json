This involves monocular 3D face reconstruction, recurrent networks, and video rendering networks. Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also involves machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) techniques. Additionally, it involves speech processing (cs.CL) as it maps the movement of the mouth regions to the source audio. Finally, it involves signal processing (cs.SD) as it translates source audio into expression parameters."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
