The paper also discusses the use of Batch Normalization, which is a technique commonly used in neural network optimization (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The study of the loss surface and optimization of Residual Networks can also fall under the category of statistical learning theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
