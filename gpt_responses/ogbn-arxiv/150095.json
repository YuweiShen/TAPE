This involves processing and analyzing visual data, which falls under the domain of computer vision. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a system that fuses a human-annotated map with an automatically inferred map, which involves machine learning techniques for map inference and fusion. \n3. cs.DB (Databases): The paper discusses the use of human-annotated maps and their integration with automatically inferred maps, which involves database management and integration. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of machine learning techniques for map inference and fusion, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper discusses the visual representation of road networks and the challenges in creating accurate and visually appealing maps, which falls under the domain of computer graphics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
