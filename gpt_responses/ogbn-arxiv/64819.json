It uses a population-based divergent-search approach to learn a set of diverse policies directly from high-dimensional observations. The algorithm also trains an autoencoder on the high-dimensional observation of the final state of the system to build a low-dimensional outcome space. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper presents a new algorithm for reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of machine learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an unsupervised learning and exploration algorithm for reinforcement learning, which falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper's focus on reinforcement learning and exploration of outcome space is relevant to robotics, which often involves learning from sparse rewards. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper's approach to learning a diverse set of policies and building a low-dimensional outcome space is relevant to systems and control. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although the paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, the use of autoencoders to build a low-dimensional outcome space is a common technique in computer vision and pattern recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
