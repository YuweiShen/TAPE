This involves the use of Correspondence Analysis and geometric data analysis, which are techniques commonly used in computational linguistics (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses segmentation and mapping of the storyline, which could fall under data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the wider application of the methodology, which could be relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
