The use of lidar also suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as a possible sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel formulation for the state estimator, which involves iterative error-state Kalman filtering, indicating machine learning (cs.LG) as another possible sub-category. The use of sensors and estimation techniques also suggests control systems (cs.SY) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, indicating artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
