Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also explores the impact of model capacity on language learning, which is a topic in machine learning and deep learning, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely category. The paper also discusses learning biases and evaluation metrics, which are topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper explores the systematic generalization of the learned language, which is a topic in software engineering and programming languages, making cs.SD (Software Engineering) a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
