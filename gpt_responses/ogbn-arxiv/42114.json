The paper also proposes a novel feature space deep residual learning algorithm, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Additionally, the paper uses numerical studies to evaluate the proposed algorithm, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
