The proposed method involves collecting various attributes of a document while the user is reading it, such as number of pages, images, math formulas, reading time, frequency, and printing experiences. These attributes are then used to filter out the target document when the user wants to re-find it later. This method involves human-computer interaction (HCI) and information retrieval (IR) techniques, which are relevant to the sub-categories of Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Cybersecurity (cs.CY), and Digital Libraries (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
