The paper proposes an improved fixed-point optimization algorithm that estimates the quantization step size dynamically during retraining. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. The experiments are conducted for feed-forward deep neural networks (FFDNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which suggests that the paper is also likely to belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
