The paper focuses on the rank selection of low-rank decomposition, which is a technique commonly used to accelerate CNNs. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a methodology to minimize network complexity while maintaining the desired accuracy, which involves combinatorial optimization and linearly-approximated accuracy function. These techniques are related to machine learning and optimization, which are covered by cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of truncated-SVD, which is a linear algebra technique, and the optimization of cost reduction, which is related to optimization and algorithms, covered by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
