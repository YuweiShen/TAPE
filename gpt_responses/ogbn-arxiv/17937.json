The paper proposes a new method for query-oriented extractive summarization using hypergraph transversals. This involves the use of topic modeling and hypergraphs, which are commonly used in NLP and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves ranking algorithms and optimization techniques, which are relevant to information retrieval (IR) and machine learning. Hence, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is also a likely sub-category. The paper proposes a new method for summarization, which involves the use of submodular functions, which are commonly used in machine learning and optimization. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves the use of algorithms and computational complexity analysis, which are relevant to computer science theory. Hence, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
