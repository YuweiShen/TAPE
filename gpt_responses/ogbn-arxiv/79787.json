This falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also discusses the use of compression and caching, which are techniques commonly used in deep learning (cs.DL) and database systems (cs.DB). Finally, the paper discusses practical tradeoffs, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
