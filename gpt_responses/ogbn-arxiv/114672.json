This involves numerical evaluation of formal series solutions at singular points, which suggests a focus on numerical analysis (cs.NA) and scientific computing (cs.SC). The use of analytic functions and combinations of formal series also suggests a connection to systems and control theory (cs.SY) and dynamical systems (cs.DS). Finally, the algorithmic nature of the approach and the focus on finding solutions to equations suggests a connection to logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
