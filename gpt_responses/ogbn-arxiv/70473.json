The use of the l1 minimization approach and the ONE-L1 algorithm suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the mathematical modeling (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the observation and evaluation of the phase transition in complex valued CS may be of interest to the statistical theory (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
