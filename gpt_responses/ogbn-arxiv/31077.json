This topic is related to software engineering (cs.SE) as it aims to improve the development process. The paper also discusses the challenges and requirements for this integration, which is related to programming languages (cs.PL). The use of live examples to provide more immediate feedback on program behavior is also related to human-computer interaction (cs.HCI). The paper presents a prototype to support the proposed approach, which is related to software design (cs.SD). Finally, the paper evaluates the system response time of the prototype, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves measuring and analyzing data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
