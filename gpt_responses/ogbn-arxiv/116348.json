Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper proposes a novel loss function to improve the intra-class cross-modality similarity, which is related to metric learning (MM) and deep learning (LG) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a new network architecture, which is related to artificial intelligence (AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed methods on benchmark datasets, which is related to cryptography and security (CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
