The focus is on atypical events that can be highly disruptive to network operators. The paper proposes a hybrid approach based on ray launching simulation and point process theory to study such events. The paper also uses large deviations theory to analyze the signal-to-interference ratio. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). \n\nThe paper also involves statistical analysis and modeling, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). \n\nThe use of ray launching simulation and point process theory for modeling and analysis suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). \n\nFinally, the paper deals with wireless communication and network performance, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
