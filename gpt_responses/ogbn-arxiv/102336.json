The experiments conducted in the paper involve visual perception and processing, which suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV). The study also involves the analysis of the learning behavior of the agents, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper emphasizes the importance of improving the links between deep reinforcement learning and cognitive science, which suggests a connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
