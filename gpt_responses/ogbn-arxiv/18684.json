The proposed method specifically addresses camera shake, which is a common cause of blur in images. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe method also involves edge detection and approximation, which falls under the category of graphics (cs.GR). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of sparse approximation, which is a common technique in machine learning and signal processing (cs.MM and cs.IT). \n\nFinally, the paper proposes a new method that is faster and easier to generalize than existing methods, which suggests a focus on optimization and efficiency (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
