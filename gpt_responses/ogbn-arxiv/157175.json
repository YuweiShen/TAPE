The use of BoVW as a feature for image recognition and retrieval also suggests that the paper could belong to the information retrieval sub-category (cs.IR). The proposed evaluation function and method for obtaining related parameters involve machine learning techniques, which could place the paper in the machine learning sub-category (cs.LG). The generation of novel images via BoVW also suggests that the paper could belong to the multimedia sub-category (cs.MM). Finally, the analysis of object classifiers could place the paper in the artificial intelligence sub-category (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
