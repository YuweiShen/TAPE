This suggests that it could fall under the Multimedia (cs.MM) or Computer Vision (cs.CV) categories. Additionally, the paper mentions using a crowd-sourcing platform to collect subjective quality scores, which could involve Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) or Information Retrieval (cs.IR) techniques.
