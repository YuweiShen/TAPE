CS is a subfield of Information Theory, and the paper derives theoretical recovery guarantees for the proposed method. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper deals with the acquisition and reconstruction of hyperspectral data in Fluorescence Spectroscopy (FS), which is a common technique in biomedical imaging. Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition techniques are often used in the analysis of such data. \n3. cs.OE (Optics and Photonics): FTI is an interferometric technique that relies on the principles of optics and photonics. The paper discusses the use of coded illumination in FTI for the acquisition of hyperspectral data in FS. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): Hyperspectral data is a type of multimedia data that captures information across a wide range of wavelengths. The paper discusses the reconstruction of such data using CS theory and coded illumination in FTI. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Machine learning techniques are often used in the analysis of hyperspectral data. While the paper does not explicitly discuss the use of machine learning, the proposed method could potentially be used as a preprocessing step for machine learning algorithms applied to hyperspectral data"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
