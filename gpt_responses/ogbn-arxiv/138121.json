The use of Autoencoder and decision forest models also suggests a language processing approach. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper focuses on detecting fake reviews, which is a common problem in information retrieval systems. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed model is a machine learning model that combines Autoencoder and decision forest. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The problem of fake reviews can also be seen as a security issue, as it can mislead users and harm businesses. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of machine learning models to detect fake reviews falls under the scope of artificial intelligence research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
