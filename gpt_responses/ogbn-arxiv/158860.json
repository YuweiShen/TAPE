The use of trees in data languages also suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS). The comparison of different models and their suitability as regular models may involve some logical reasoning (cs.LO). Additionally, the use of data values from an infinite alphabet may involve some aspects of database theory (cs.DB) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
