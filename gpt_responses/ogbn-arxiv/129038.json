This topic is related to several sub-categories in computer science, including Signal Processing (cs.SD), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Sound (cs.SI). The paper proposes an unsupervised approach for estimating spatial information using multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization (MNMF) and investigates the performances of various types of spatial filters. Therefore, cs.SD and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.LG and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
