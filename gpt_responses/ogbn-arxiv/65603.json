The paper focuses on the limitations of three formal definitions of fairness and proposes an alternative strategy based on statistically accurate estimates of risk. This topic is most closely related to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses issues related to cybersecurity (cs.CR) and societal impacts (cs.SI) of machine learning algorithms. Finally, the paper proposes a new approach to fair machine learning that involves careful measurement and analysis of data, which could be categorized under the sub-category of Cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
