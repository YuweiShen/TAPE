The focus is on improving the generalization performance of Adam, a popular optimization algorithm for deep neural networks, which is often used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) tasks. The paper also proposes a new algorithm, ND-Adam, which involves controlling the update direction and step size, which is a common technique in optimization algorithms for neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
