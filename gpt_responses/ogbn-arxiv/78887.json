This suggests a potential connection to AI, as AI algorithms can be used to play these games.\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper discusses the complexity of 2D platform games, which are a type of game. Additionally, Xiangqi and Janggi are both strategic board games, which are often studied in game theory.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper introduces new gadgets and constructs them in Xiangqi and Janggi, which involves designing and analyzing algorithms and data structures.\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper discusses 2D platform games, which involve geometric objects and their interactions. Additionally, the construction of gadgets in Xiangqi and Janggi may involve geometric considerations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
