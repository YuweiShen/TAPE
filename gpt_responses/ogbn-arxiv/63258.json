The paper also discusses the use of large annotated datasets and affordable computation power, which are key components of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are a popular machine learning technique used in multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Finally, the paper discusses the evaluation of the proposed face detector on challenging datasets, which is related to computer security and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
