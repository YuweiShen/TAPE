This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of attention maps and the identification of important features suggest the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also has implications for healthcare (cs.MED) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) as it discusses the potential use of mobile phones and inexpensive attachments for obtaining retinal fundus photos in regions where autorefractors may not be readily available."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
