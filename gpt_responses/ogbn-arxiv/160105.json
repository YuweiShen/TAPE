The paper focuses on continuous control tasks and proposes a method that allows decomposition of the hierarchical layers into independent subtasks, yet allows for joint training of all layers in an end-to-end manner. The method combines a control policy on a lower level with an image-based planning policy on a higher level. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel HRL architecture that enhances the capabilities of RL agents via operation on different levels of temporal abstraction. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for solving long-horizon sequential decision making tasks in environments with sparse rewards, which is a longstanding problem in RL research. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper focuses on continuous control tasks, which are relevant to robotics applications. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper proposes an image-based planning policy on a higher level, which is relevant to computer vision applications. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method for solving sequential decision making tasks, which is relevant to systems and control applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
