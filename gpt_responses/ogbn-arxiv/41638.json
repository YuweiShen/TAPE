This involves techniques such as training convolutional neural networks, reducing descriptor length, and modifying hierarchical graph matching strategy. These techniques are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV), information retrieval (cs.IR), cryptography and security (cs.CR), multimedia (cs.MM), and machine learning (cs.LG) research areas. Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
