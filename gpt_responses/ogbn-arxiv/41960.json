The approach involves estimating the support of the expert policy, which is related to control and robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also includes experiments on both discrete and continuous domains, which are common in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
