The most relevant sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). However, the paper also discusses the applications of these extensions in formal specifications, which could place it in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper presents a decidable logic with a finitary axiomatization, which could be of interest to researchers in cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
