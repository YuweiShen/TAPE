The paper also discusses the application of these methods in the context of database management systems (cs.DB) and includes numerical experiments (cs.NA). Finally, the paper presents new closed-form expressions for the proximity operator of two-variable functions, which may be of interest to researchers in the field of discrete mathematics and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
