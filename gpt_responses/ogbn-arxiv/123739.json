This involves addressing the challenge of allowing MEC applications to move with their users without being anchored to the core network. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of programmable switches to implement MEGW, which involves the use of software-defined networking (SDN) techniques. This could place the paper in the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of LTE control plane and location-dependent traffic steering for edge connections, which could place it in the Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality (cs.AR) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories, respectively. Finally, the paper discusses the simulation of the MEGW algorithm, which could place it in the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
