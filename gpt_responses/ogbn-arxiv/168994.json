These are topics that are typically covered in the sub-categories of cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also proposes a generic denoiser that does not depend on prior distribution, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of extrinsic information and optimization of parametric extrinsic denoisers are also topics that are relevant to the sub-category of cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper presents numerical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of cs.SI (Signal Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
