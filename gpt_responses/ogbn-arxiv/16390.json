The use of gated recurrent units (GRU) is a common technique in deep learning (cs.LG) and the paper also mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN), which is a popular technique in computer vision. The paper also involves learning the inter-modal relations between image and sentence, which is a task related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
