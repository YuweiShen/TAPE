The paper proposes two new algorithms for constructing reachability oracles, which are designed to be simple, fast, and scalable. These algorithms are evaluated on large real-world graphs and are shown to outperform existing approaches in terms of construction time, index size, and query performance. Given the focus on graph algorithms and data structures, as well as the use of terms like \"scalable\" and \"real-world graphs,\" it is likely that this paper belongs to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. However, the paper also deals with database and artificial intelligence applications of reachability oracles, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.DB (Databases) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper makes use of geometric concepts like \"transitive closure compression\" and \"online search,\" which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.CG (Computational Geometry) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the practical implications of its results, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
