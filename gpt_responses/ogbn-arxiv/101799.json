This suggests that the paper could belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel realizability semantics and a natural deduction calculus, which are both related to programming languages and could place the paper in the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The paper also discusses the computational meaning of strategies and winning conditions, which could be relevant to the Game Theory (cs.GT) sub-category. Furthermore, the paper mentions the extraction of computational artifacts from game proofs, which could be related to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
