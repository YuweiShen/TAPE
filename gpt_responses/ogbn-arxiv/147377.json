This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): Multicopters are a type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and are commonly used in robotics applications. The paper discusses the design of a failsafe mechanism for multicopters, which is relevant to the field of robotics.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves designing a failsafe mechanism for multicopters, which requires taking into account real-time information from guidance, attitude control, diagnosis, and other low-level subsystems. This involves the use of AI techniques such as decision-making and control.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the design and implementation of a failsafe mechanism for multicopters, which involves modeling the user requirements, multicopter modes and events, and control specifications. This falls under the scope of software engineering.\n- cs.EM (Emerging Technologies): Multicopters are a relatively new and emerging technology, and the paper discusses the design of a failsafe mechanism for them. This falls under the scope of emerging technologies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
