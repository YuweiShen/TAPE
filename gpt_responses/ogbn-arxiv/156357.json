The method involves segmenting the analog signal and using parallel branches of mixers and integrators (BMIs) with specific random sampling waveforms to collect subsamples on different segments. The subsamples are then reused to collect a larger number of samples than the number of BMIs. This technique is shown to be equivalent to extending the measurement matrix, which consists of the BMI sampling waveforms, by adding new rows without actually increasing the number of BMIs. The paper discusses the restricted isometry property of the extended measurement matrix and its impact on signal recovery performance. Based on this analysis, the paper belongs to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the performance of the proposed method in terms of the restricted isometry property and signal recovery. This is a key topic in information theory, which deals with the fundamental limits of communication and data processing. \n- cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper proposes a new method for analog-to-information conversion and analyzes its performance in terms of signal recovery. This is a core topic in signal processing, which deals with the analysis, synthesis, and manipulation of signals. \n- cs.SP (Speech Processing): Although the paper does not focus on speech signals specifically, the proposed method can be applied to any analog"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
