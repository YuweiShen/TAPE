The paper also mentions the use of geometric inductive biases, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper uses graph properties as metrics, which is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and social networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with optimization techniques for graph embeddings, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
