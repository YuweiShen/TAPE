The paper proposes a computational model and an epistemic temporal logic used to reason about knowledge acquired by observing program outputs, which falls under programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper discusses information flow properties, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
