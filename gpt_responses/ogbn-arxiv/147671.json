This involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) to model the state transitions. The paper also presents novel compilations of the learned factored planning problem using Weighted Partial Maximum Boolean Satisfiability (cs.PL) and Binary Linear Programming (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper discusses a finite-time incremental constraint generation algorithm based on generalized landmark constraints, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
