This involves developing a predictive framework and identifying key functional entities and their interaction. The paper also provides a case study on stored video streaming and presents a distributed heuristic to reduce resource consumption. Given the focus on wireless networks and mobility prediction, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The use of predictive models and machine learning techniques suggests a potential fit with cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The emphasis on energy efficiency and optimization aligns with cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
