The methodology proposed in the paper also involves formal specification and analysis, which are common in software engineering (cs.SE) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). The tracer is used to generate information for graphical views of executions, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Lastly, the paper discusses the efficiency of the tracer, which is relevant to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
