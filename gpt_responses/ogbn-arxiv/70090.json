The paper also discusses the training of these networks and their ability to learn generic feature extractors, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of convolutional networks for different tasks also touches on the topic of transfer learning (cs.CL). Finally, the paper mentions the time needed to train deep networks, which is a common concern in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
