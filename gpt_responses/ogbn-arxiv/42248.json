Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the communication system in a single cell, which falls under the category of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also deals with the allocation of sum capacity, which is related to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also discusses the use of multiple antennas, which falls under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the communication system with many users, which is related to cs.COM (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
