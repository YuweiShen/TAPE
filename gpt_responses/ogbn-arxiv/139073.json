The use of Vizing's theorem and the study of subgraphs suggest that the paper may belong to the Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) or Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. The study of graphs and their properties also suggests that the paper may belong to the Computational Geometry (cs.CG) or Graph Theory (cs.GT) sub-categories.
