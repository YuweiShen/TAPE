This involves jointly optimizing data augmentation and network training by designing an augmentation network that competes against a target network. This approach is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
