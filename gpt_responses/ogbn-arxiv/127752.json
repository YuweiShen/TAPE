The paper also introduces novel tensor composition functions and uses web data for semantic augmentation, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV and cs.CL, followed by cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
