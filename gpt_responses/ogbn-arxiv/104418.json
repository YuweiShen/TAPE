The use of Gaussian processes (GPs) for modeling the response surface and Bayesian optimization for efficient search is a popular approach in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) communities. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of iterative optimization techniques, which is a common theme in numerical analysis and optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
