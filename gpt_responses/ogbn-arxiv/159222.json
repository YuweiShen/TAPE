This is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV), information retrieval (cs.IR), and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also mentions audio-sheet-music retrieval, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a neural network layer that learns better embedding spaces, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
