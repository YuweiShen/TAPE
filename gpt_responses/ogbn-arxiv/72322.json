Therefore, the most likely category is cs.MA (Multiagent Systems). The paper also deals with problems related to consensus, clustering, gathering, and aggregation, which are topics studied in the subfields of distributed computing (cs.DC), distributed systems (cs.DS), control systems (cs.SY), and robotics (cs.RO).
