Additionally, the paper also introduces an active learning strategy to reduce labeling costs, which falls under the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of deep neural networks and ensembles also suggests a potential fit for the sub-categories of cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the focus on evolving data streams indicates a possible fit for the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
