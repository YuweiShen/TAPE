This involves repeated sampling of the simulation over the uncertain input data, which is a common problem in numerical analysis. \n\n2. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper describes a software technique for implementing embedded ensemble propagation based on the use of C++ templates and its integration with various scientific computing libraries within Trilinos. This involves software engineering principles and practices. \n\n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses how the embedded ensemble propagation approach takes advantage of properties of modern computer architectures to improve performance by enabling reuse between samples, reducing memory bandwidth requirements, improving memory access patterns, improving opportunities for fine-grained parallelization, and reducing communication costs. This involves distributed, parallel, and cluster computing. \n\n4. cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper describes a new method for propagating uncertainties in simulation input data to output quantities of interest. This involves the development of mathematical software. \n\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper applies the embedded ensemble propagation approach to the simulation of partial differential equations on a variety of CPU, GPU, and accelerator architectures, including up to 131,072 cores on a Cray XK7 (Titan)."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
