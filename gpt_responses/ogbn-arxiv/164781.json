Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves statistical models and optimization problems, which could place it in the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also mentions mesh decoders, which could potentially place it in the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
