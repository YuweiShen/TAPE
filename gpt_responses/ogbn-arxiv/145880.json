The paper proposes a new method for processing such queries based on relevance models between entity sets and concepts. This method involves using a conceptual taxonomy, which is a hierarchical structure that organizes entities into concepts based on their isA relationships. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Databases (cs.DB), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
