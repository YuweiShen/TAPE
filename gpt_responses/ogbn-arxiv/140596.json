The paper also mentions subject domains such as STM (science, technology, and medicine) disciplines, which could fall under the category of cybernetics (CY) or cryptography (CR). Additionally, the paper focuses on two specific collections of scientific literature, Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus, which are both databases and could further support the likelihood of this paper belonging to the cs.DB sub-category. Finally, the use of author identifiers such as Researcher ID and ORCID could also relate to the sub-category of digital libraries (DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
