The paper also presents a practical approach to tackle the problem, which involves machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of AI. Additionally, the paper discusses the optimization of expected discounted-sum payoff, which is a topic that falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with decision-making under uncertainty, which is a topic that falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents a practical approach to tackle the problem, which involves computational techniques such as dynamic programming, which is a topic that falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
