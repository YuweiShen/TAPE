This work involves aspects of electronics engineering, information theory, computer vision, networking, and data structures. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.ET (Emerging Technologies), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
