The use of linear precoding and message-passing backhaul network architecture suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper proposes a topologically robust scheme, which involves designing algorithms and protocols that can handle uncertain or changing network topologies, making computer science theory (cs.DS) another likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
