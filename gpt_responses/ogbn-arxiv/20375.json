The use of hypergraph categories and Frobenius structures is also relevant to the study of computational complexity (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper mentions applications in natural language processing (cs.CL) and quantum processes (cs.QO), which could also suggest the possibility of it being classified under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or quantum computing (cs.QO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
