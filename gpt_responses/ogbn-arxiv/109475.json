The paper presents a new algorithm for maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a matroid independence constraint, which establishes a tradeoff between the number of value oracle queries and the number of matroid independence queries performed by the algorithm. This result is of interest to researchers in several subfields of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
