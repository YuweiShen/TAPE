The method presented in the paper involves training a network to capture a new speaker from a short untranscribed audio sample, which involves techniques from speech processing and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and speech processing. \n\nThe paper also involves training a network using consistency losses, which is a technique used in deep learning and falls under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nThe paper also involves embedding the speaker in the embedding space, which is a technique used in unsupervised learning and falls under the sub-category of cs.SD (Sound). \n\nFinally, the paper deals with fitting new voices, which involves techniques from transfer learning and falls under the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
