The paper also uses algebraic considerations to characterize the set of strings with the same substring compositions, which falls under computational complexity (cs.CC). The problem can be viewed as a simplification of the turnpike problem, which is a well-known problem in computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete mathematics. Finally, the paper provides an algorithm for reconstructing random strings in near-quadratic time, which falls under data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
