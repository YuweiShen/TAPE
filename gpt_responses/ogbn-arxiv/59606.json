The use of multi-armed bandits (MABs) is a popular approach to solving this problem, which is also studied in game theory (cs.GT). The fact that users cannot communicate with each other suggests a networked systems perspective (cs.NI), while the need to account for user-dependent rewards implies a machine learning or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) component. Finally, the paper presents a policy that achieves a certain level of performance, which can be seen as a control or optimization problem, falling under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
