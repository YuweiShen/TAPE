The use of correlation measures and the focus on identifying groups of informative features suggest that the paper may belong to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper's emphasis on improving prediction performance and discovering underlying group structures may also align with sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The use of real-world datasets and empirical studies may suggest a focus on data analysis and statistics, which could place the paper in sub-categories such as cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.ST (Statistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
