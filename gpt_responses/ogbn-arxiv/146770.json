The goal is to alert a clinician when a patient's risk of deterioration rises, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and potentially complex events (cs.SI). Finally, the paper also discusses experimental evaluation of different explanation methods, which falls under computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
