The use of joint sparse regression and hierarchical mixed norm also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the use of depth and skeleton-based features could also place it in the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper's focus on modeling actions as a combination of features suggests that it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of structured sparsity and group feature selection could also suggest that it belongs to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
