The examples given in the paper also involve the analysis of high-throughput data (cs.SI) and dynamical systems (cs.DS), which are relevant sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes numerical criteria for comparing linear and non-linear mappings, which could fall under the sub-category of computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
