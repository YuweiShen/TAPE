This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and specifically multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The paper also discusses the use of communication and signal processing techniques to achieve this, which falls under the categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper uses fusion techniques to estimate the relative positions of the MAVs, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
