The proposed method involves a learning algorithm that optimizes multi-layer parameters, which suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) approach. The use of an And-Or graph model for handling intra-class variance and background clutters indicates a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The validation of the proposed method on several databases suggests a multimedia (cs.MM) application. Finally, the use of discriminative learning for object detection suggests an information retrieval (cs.IR) aspect."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
