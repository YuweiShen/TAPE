The paper specifically focuses on using a differentiable maximum satisfiability (MAXSAT) solver to learn the logical structure of challenging problems in a minimally supervised fashion. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper deals with integrating logical reasoning into deep learning systems. Additionally, the paper also discusses using the MAXSAT solver in combination with a traditional convolutional architecture to solve a \"visual Sudoku\" problem, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the paper's use of a fast coordinate descent approach to solving the semidefinite program (SDP) associated with the MAXSAT problem suggests that it may also fall under the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
