The paper also proposes a solution using secure computation, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The use of secure computation also involves machine learning techniques to prevent over-fitting, which could fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the computational challenges of verifying the quality of goods, which could be relevant to the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
