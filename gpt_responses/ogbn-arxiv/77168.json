The paper proposes a randomized algorithm for exact recovery of the underlying sparse sets and the corresponding coefficients, which is a problem of interest in the field of machine learning. The paper also provides sample complexity bounds and analyzes the effect of noise on the algorithm. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.ST (Statistics), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
