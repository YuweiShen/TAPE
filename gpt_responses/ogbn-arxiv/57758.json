Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses the use of neural networks for planning, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) as well. The paper deals with planning in the context of robotics and systems, which could place it in cs.RO (Robotics and Control) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper discusses the use of RDDL, which is a language for modeling decision-making problems, suggesting that it could belong to cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
