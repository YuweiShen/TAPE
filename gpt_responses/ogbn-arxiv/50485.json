The use of a computer search suggests that it may also be relevant to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Computational Geometry (cs.CG) categories. Finally, the problem of finding infeasible and universal instances involves algorithmic and data structure considerations, which could make it relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
