The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) as it discusses the effective network throughput and interference. Additionally, the paper focuses on the use of directional communications with narrow beams, which falls under the subfield of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also involves system engineering (cs.SY) as it proposes algorithms to solve the optimization problem. Finally, the paper discusses interference, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
