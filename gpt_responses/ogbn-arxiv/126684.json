This falls under the purview of distributed computing, making cs.DC the most likely category.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): Edge Computing involves utilizing computational capabilities in edge nodes such as base stations, routers, and switches. This requires a strong understanding of networking and internet architecture, making cs.NI a likely category.\n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering): Edge Computing involves developing software that can run on edge nodes efficiently. This requires a strong understanding of software engineering principles, making cs.SE a likely category.\n4. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): Edge Computing involves utilizing computational capabilities in edge nodes such as base stations, routers, and switches. This requires a strong understanding of hardware architecture, making cs.AR a possible category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): Edge Computing involves developing systems that can distribute computational load towards the edge of the network.
