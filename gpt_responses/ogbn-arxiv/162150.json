The paper specifically mentions the use of neural networks for image and text domains, which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) as likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the development of custom neural network architectures, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
