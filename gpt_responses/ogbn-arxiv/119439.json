This involves designing a new coding scheme that can offer significant coding gains over conventional precoding systems. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The proposed model is designed for mmwave radio-over-fiber systems, which are a type of wireless communication network. The paper discusses how the photonic hybrid precoding strategy can mitigate inter-user interference, which is a common problem in wireless networks. \n3. cs.OH (Optimization and Control): The paper proposes a new photonic hybrid precoding model that uses silicon photonic integrated circuits (Si-PICs) to overcome hardware constraints on radio frequency precoding. This involves optimizing the design of the Si-PICs to achieve the desired precoding performance. \n4. cs.PH (Physics): The paper discusses the use of photonic hybrid precoding for mmwave radio-over-fiber systems, which involves the use of silicon photonic integrated circuits (Si-PICs). This requires an understanding of the physics of how light interacts with silicon to design the Si-PICs. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The proposed model is designed for mmwave radio-over-fiber systems, which are commonly used for high-speed"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
