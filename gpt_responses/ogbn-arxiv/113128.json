This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of deep learning models for prediction also suggests the possibility of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) being a relevant sub-category. The dataset used in the paper was crawled from the web, which could also suggest multimedia (cs.MM) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with image-based prediction, which could also fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
