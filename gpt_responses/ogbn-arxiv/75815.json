The use of real-world measurements and ray-tracing studies suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the mention of an urban-macro environment suggests that the paper may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) or Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the use of modeling techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.MA) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
