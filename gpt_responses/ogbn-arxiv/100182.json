The method involves re-ranking response candidates generated from conversational models using event causality relations between events in a dialogue history and response candidates. This paper is likely to belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) as it deals with dialogue context and response generation. It also involves the use of machine learning techniques such as distributed event representation and Role Factored Tensor Model, which are commonly used in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also involves the use of information retrieval techniques to match event causality relations, which is a common topic in Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Semantic Web (cs.SI) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
