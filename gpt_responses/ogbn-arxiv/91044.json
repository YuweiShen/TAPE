The paper discusses the use of hybrid analog/digital precoding to reduce the cost of hardware in these systems. The paper also discusses the use of feedback schemes to optimize the analog beamformer and digital precoder. These topics are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), signal processing (cs.SI), multimedia (cs.MM), and computer communication (cs.COM). Among these, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely sub-categories, as the paper deals with information theory and networking aspects of millimeter wave systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
