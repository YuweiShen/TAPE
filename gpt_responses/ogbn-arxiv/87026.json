The paper mentions applications in control theory, robotics, and computer algebra systems. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), which deals with algorithms and systems for symbolic manipulation of mathematical expressions. The paper also deals with dynamical systems (cs.DS) and numerical analysis (cs.NA) aspects of the problem. Additionally, the paper mentions experimental results (cs.LO) and provides a discussion on the practical aspects of the algorithm. Finally, the paper deals with algebraic geometry (cs.AG) concepts such as varieties and solutions of polynomial systems, which could also be a relevant sub-category. However, since the paper focuses more on algorithmic aspects than on geometric concepts, we consider cs.AG to be less likely than the other sub-categories mentioned."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
