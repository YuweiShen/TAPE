The paper also discusses the complexity of computing corresponding \"almost\" equilibrium notions, which involves algorithms and computational complexity (cs.AI). The paper uses FIXP_a-completeness and PPAD-completeness, which are concepts from computational complexity theory (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the size of normal form games (NFGs) and their encoding as EFGPRs, which involves data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the extension of complexity results to the more general setting of EFGPRs, which involves machine learning and statistical analysis (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
