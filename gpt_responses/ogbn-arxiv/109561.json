Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also proposes heuristic algorithms to solve the problem, which involves optimization and decision-making, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory). The use of directional mmWave links and the need for coordination of BH interface movements could also place it in cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper deals with the impact of reconfiguration on existing traffic, which could be relevant to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
