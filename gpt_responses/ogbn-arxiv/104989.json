Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves communication theory and signal processing, which are covered by cs.COMM (Communication) and cs.SI (Signal and Image Processing). The paper also deals with wireless communication, which falls under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Finally, the paper involves optimization and complexity reduction, which are covered by cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
