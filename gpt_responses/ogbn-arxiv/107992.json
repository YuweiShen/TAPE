Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also introduces a related model called ST-configuration structures, which extends configuration structures, indicating a possible connection to cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.LT (Automata and Formal Languages). The paper also discusses the expressive power of the modal logics, which could be relevant to cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
