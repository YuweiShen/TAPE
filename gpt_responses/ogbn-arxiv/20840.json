The use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The focus on brain extraction and neuroimage analysis could also place it in the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the mention of fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggests that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
