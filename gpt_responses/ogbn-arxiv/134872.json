This involves predicting per-user application usage to minimize wasted precomputation. The paper focuses on the use of machine learning models, particularly RNNs, to improve prediction accuracy and reduce computational costs. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
