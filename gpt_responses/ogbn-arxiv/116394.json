The paper proposes a new formulation of max-return optimization that allows the problem to be re-expressed by an expectation over an arbitrary behavior-agnostic and off-policy data distribution. This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). However, given the focus on RL algorithms, we believe that cs.LG is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.AI and cs.RO. The other two sub-categories are less likely but still possible given the theoretical and algorithmic contributions of the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
