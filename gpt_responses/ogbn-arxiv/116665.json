This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT), as the channel capacity is analyzed and maximized. Additionally, the use of proteins for communication involves biological and neural networks (cs.NE) and systems and control (cs.SY). The energy consumption aspect of the system falls under the category of energy and power (cs.ET), while the use of vesicles for communication is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
