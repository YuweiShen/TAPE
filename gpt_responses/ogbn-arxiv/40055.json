The use of local conditions to preserve graph classes suggests a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), while the focus on finding the maximum number of edges in a planar graph suggests a connection to graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the mention of \"side effects\" and \"non-deterministic\" and \"non-confluent\" reductions suggests a connection to software engineering and programming languages (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
