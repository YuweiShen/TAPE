This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) as the agent is required to plan a sequence of actions to achieve its goal. The paper also involves computer vision (cs.CV) as it uses visual perception to construct a spatial memory of the environment. Additionally, the paper involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as the agent is required to learn from various modalities and plan a sequence of actions based on observations. Finally, the paper involves signal processing (cs.SD) as it deals with inferring the relative location of the sound source from the agent."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
