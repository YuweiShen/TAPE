The use of graphs and their properties, such as expanders and bi-regular extractors, suggests categories such as cs.DS (data structures and algorithms) and cs.CG (computational geometry). Finally, the mention of l1 and l2 guarantees on induced distributions from large subsets suggests a connection to game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
