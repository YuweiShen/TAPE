It may also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) as it deals with natural language sequences. Additionally, it could be relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as sequential data is often encountered in image and video analysis. It may also be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as sequential data is a common input for many AI applications. Finally, it could be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as the paper discusses efficient computation of the proposed kernels."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
