The focus of the paper is on improving detection performance in scenes with heavy occlusions, which requires advanced algorithms for feature extraction and decision-making. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to subcategories such as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm, which is a common technique in robotics and control (cs.RO) for filtering redundant information. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on two datasets commonly used for object detection in autonomous driving (KITTI) and pedestrian detection in urban scenes (CityPersons), which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision for robotics (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
