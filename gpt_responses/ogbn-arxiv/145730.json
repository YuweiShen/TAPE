The proposed method is based on deep neural network (cs.LG) and aims to produce good codes that preserve similarity, balance, and independence. The method is also extended to supervised hashing by leveraging label information (cs.AI). Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods, which is a common evaluation metric in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
