The paper also discusses the use of pretraining and voting techniques, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper mentions the use of Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) algorithm, which is a deep learning technique (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
