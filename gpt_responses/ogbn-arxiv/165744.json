The approach is based on modifying the input image and training a network, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions using a network designed for object localization, which could potentially involve neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
