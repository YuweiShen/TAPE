It also involves robotics (cs.RO) as one of the applications of the proposed method. The use of deep neural networks suggests that it could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed method on existing datasets suggests that it could also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
