It could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it proposes a novel approach that uses neural models to automatically evaluate the output of machine translation systems. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as it involves the detection of discourse relations in the source text, and cs.CY (Computers and Society) as it addresses the need for better evaluation metrics for online machine translation systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
