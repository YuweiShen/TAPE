This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses approaches for latent representation of entities and relations via KBs, which are relevant to the Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of deep neural architectures also suggests relevance to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of KBs for semantic translation, which is relevant to the Databases (cs.DB) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
