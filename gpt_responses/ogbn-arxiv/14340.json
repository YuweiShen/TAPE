The paper also introduces a mixed-pooling strategy and an effective fusion method, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the proposed method can be applied to various NLP tasks, such as text classification and named entity recognition, which are also related to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
