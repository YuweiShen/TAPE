This falls under the domain of information theory, which deals with the transmission, processing, and utilization of information. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper focuses on improving the QoS for a large number of users in multi-cell wireless networks using massive MIMO and beamforming techniques. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture, which deals with the design, implementation, and management of computer networks and communication systems. \n\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new time-fraction-wise beamforming technique to unblock the bottleneck of serving small numbers of users by a large number of transmit antennas. This falls under the domain of systems and control, which deals with the analysis, design, and optimization of complex systems. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of massive MIMO and beamforming techniques to improve the quality-of-experience (QoE) of wireless communication systems, which is relevant to multimedia applications such as video streaming and online gaming. \n\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new beamforming technique that focuses signal transmission in fractions of a time slot, which could"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
