The paper proposes new bi-criteria approximation algorithms for this problem, which are based on linear programming and local search. These algorithms have polynomial dependence on the dimension of the input data, and are applicable in high-dimensional settings. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes new algorithms for the k-means clustering problem, which is a fundamental problem in data analysis and machine learning. The algorithms are based on linear programming and local search, and have polynomial dependence on the dimension of the input data. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to the cs.DS sub-category. \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The k-means clustering problem is a fundamental problem in machine learning, and the paper proposes new algorithms for this problem. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to the cs.LG sub-category. \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The k-means clustering problem is a fundamental problem in data analysis and machine learning, which are both sub-fields of artificial intelligence. The paper proposes new algorithms for this problem, which are based on linear programming and local search. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to the cs.AI sub-category"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
