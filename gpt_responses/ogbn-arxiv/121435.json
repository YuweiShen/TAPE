This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms, making cs.DS the most likely category.\n2. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The All-k-Nearest-Neighbor problem is a common problem in computational geometry, and the paper proposes a new algorithm to solve it. Therefore, cs.CG is also a likely category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The All-k-Nearest-Neighbor problem is a common problem in machine learning, and the paper proposes a new algorithm to solve it. Therefore, cs.LG is also a likely category.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The All-k-Nearest-Neighbor problem is a common problem in artificial intelligence, and the paper proposes a new algorithm to solve it.
