This involves several computer vision techniques such as edge detection, image segmentation, and lens calibration. \n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with the analysis of high-resolution electroluminescence images of photovoltaic modules to visually and non-destructively inspect the quality of solar cells. This involves the retrieval of relevant information from the images using computer vision techniques. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed method involves the use of machine learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification of solar cells in electroluminescence images. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the analysis of multimedia data in the form of high-resolution electroluminescence images of photovoltaic modules. This involves the use of computer vision techniques to extract relevant information from the images. \n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The proposed method has potential applications in the field of robotics for automated inspection of photovoltaic modules. This involves the use of computer vision techniques to extract relevant information from the images and control the movement of robots for inspection purposes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
