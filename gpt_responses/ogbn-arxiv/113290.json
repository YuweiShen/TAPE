The paper also proposes a novel abstraction of the Internet topology, which could be considered as a theoretical computer science topic (cs.IT). The paper discusses the potential of this topology for provisioning guaranteed end-to-end services, which could be categorized under security and privacy (cs.CR) and systems and control (cs.SI). Finally, the paper introduces an algorithmic framework for path stitching, which could be categorized under distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
