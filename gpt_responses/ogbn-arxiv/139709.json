Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the complexity of constructing and decoding these codes, which falls under the scope of cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The use of large kernels in polar codes is a novel approach, which could potentially fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper discusses the optimality of the scaling exponent, which could be considered a topic in cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
