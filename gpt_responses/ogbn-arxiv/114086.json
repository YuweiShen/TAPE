The paper proposes an oracle-based algorithm that is computationally efficient and achieves a regret of order $O((KT)^{\\frac{2}{3}}(\\log N)^{\\frac{1}{3}})$. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
