However, the focus of the paper is on the use of random matrix theory to design an enhanced algorithm for constructing FDI attack vectors in the face of limited measurements. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), which deals with the analysis, design, and control of complex systems such as power grids. Other likely sub-categories include cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), which are all relevant to the problem of constructing FDI attacks against power grids."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
