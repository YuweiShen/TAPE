The proposed approach of using channel decoders for probabilistic inference also falls under the scope of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper's focus on algorithms and hardware implementation suggests that it could also be relevant to the data structures and algorithms sub-category (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
