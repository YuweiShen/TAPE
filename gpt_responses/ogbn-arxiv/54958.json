This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper proposes a technique to strengthen the secrecy in the case of distributed encryption where the encryption keys are correlated to each other. This falls under the domain of cryptography and security.\n3. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper does not explicitly deal with computational complexity, but the use of affine encoders and linear encoders may involve some computational complexity.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper does not explicitly deal with social and information networks, but the problem of distributed encryption and secure communication is relevant in the context of social and information networks.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper does not explicitly deal with multimedia, but the problem of distributed encryption and secure communication is relevant in the context of multimedia applications such as video conferencing and streaming."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
