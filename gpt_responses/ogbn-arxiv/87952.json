Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related topics. The paper also discusses the use of neural networks, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with active learning, which is a subfield of machine learning and falls under cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper discusses the practical aspects of using a domain expert's time, which could be relevant to researchers in cs.DL (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) who are interested in optimizing resource allocation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
