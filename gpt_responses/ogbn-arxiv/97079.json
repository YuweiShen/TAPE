The paper proposes an end-to-end trainable fast scene text detector, which involves deep learning techniques, making it likely to belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category as well. The paper also focuses on achieving high accuracy and efficiency, which are key concerns in machine learning, making it likely to belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category. The paper involves text recognition, which is a natural language processing task, making it likely to belong to the cs.CL (Computation and Language) category. Finally, the paper involves evaluation on public datasets, which is a common practice in information retrieval, making it likely to belong to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
