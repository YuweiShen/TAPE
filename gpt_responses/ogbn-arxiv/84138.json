This topic falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG), which are the most likely categories. The paper also discusses the use of adaptive and difficulty-aware learning, which could be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as end-to-end trainable frameworks, which could relate to computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
