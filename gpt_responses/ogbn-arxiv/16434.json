The paper also discusses computation procedures and algorithms, which are relevant to computer graphics (cs.CG) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel symbolic solution, which falls under the category of symbolic computation (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
