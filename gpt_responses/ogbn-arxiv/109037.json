The use of A3C, a popular deep reinforcement learning algorithm, suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The exploration of randomly-generated labyrinths and the need for memory and planning suggest that the paper may also fall under the categories of game theory (cs.GT) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the use of reinforcement learning in a task involving navigation and exploration suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
