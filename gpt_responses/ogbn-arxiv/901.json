The use of algorithms and optimization also suggests that it could belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The study of network topology and visibility could also place it in the cs.SOC (Social and Economic Networks) sub-category. The consideration of network coverage problems and the ability to interact strategically with the network could suggest the cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) sub-category.
