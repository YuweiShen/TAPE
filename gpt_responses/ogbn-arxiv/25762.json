Specifically, the method involves using two complementary networks to address the problem of catastrophic forgetting, which is a common issue in neural network training. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the method involves classification tasks, which suggests that cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) could also be relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
