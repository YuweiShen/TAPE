This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The joint user scheduling and beam selection problem is formulated using the Lyapunov-drift optimization framework, which is a control theory technique used in systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also proposes algorithms for solving the optimization problem, which involves coordination and optimization of blocks, and incremental greedy scheduling, which are techniques used in machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
