The use of single-peaked preferences and the focus on constructive control suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of preference modeling and representation (cs.DS). The algorithms and complexity results presented in the paper involve techniques from parameterized complexity (cs.CC) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), as well as some graph theory (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG) concepts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
