It proposes a novel mechanism that combines a deep-learning based price forecasting model as well as an algorithm parameterized by a user-specific urgency value to recommend gas prices. This involves analyzing historic block data and using predictive modeling techniques. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
