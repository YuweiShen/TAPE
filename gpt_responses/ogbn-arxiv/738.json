Additionally, the use of CNN-based pipeline suggests that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. The attention mechanism used in the proposed method suggests that it may also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category. Finally, the use of the term \"fusion module\" suggests that it may also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
