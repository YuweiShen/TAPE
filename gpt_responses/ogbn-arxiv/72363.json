The paper also discusses a mesoscopic approach to configuring the network, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The use of conductance-based synapses and switched-capacitor technology suggests a focus on electronic circuits (cs.ET). Finally, the biohybrid aspect of the system suggests a potential overlap with the field of synthetic biology (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
