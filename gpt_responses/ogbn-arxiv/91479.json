The paper also discusses the impact of non-ideal hardware, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM). The use of interference alignment and coordinated multi-point techniques also involves system-level optimization and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the techniques using a real-world wireless testbed, which could fall under the category of computer architecture and robotics (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
