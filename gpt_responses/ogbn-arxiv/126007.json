The use of features based on sample mean and sample variance also suggests an information theory perspective.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper compares the performance of different supervised machine learning techniques for modulation recognition. This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to the machine learning category.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): One of the supervised machine learning techniques used in the paper is neural networks. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing category.\n- cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper deals with signals having root-raised-cosine shaped pulses and uses features based on the product of two consecutive complex signal values. These are typical signal processing concepts.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of machine learning techniques for modulation recognition is a clear indication that the paper could also belong to the artificial intelligence category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
