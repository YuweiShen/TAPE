It also involves modeling patient trust of family doctors using a large-scale dataset of consultation histories, which could fall under Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) categories. Additionally, the paper may also be relevant to Cybernetics (cs.CY) and Sound (cs.SD) categories as it involves developing a hybrid recommender system and accounting for the temporal dynamics of patient-doctor relationships."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
