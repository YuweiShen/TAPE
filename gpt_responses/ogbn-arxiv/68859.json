The paper proposes a new algebraic technique to evaluate any variadic expression between polyhedral d-solids (d = 2, 3) with regularized operators of union, intersection, and difference, i.e., any CSG tree. This suggests that the paper could belong to cs.CG (Computational Geometry) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also mentions the use of sparse arrays in Julia, which could indicate that it belongs to cs.SC (Symbolic Computation) or cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Finally, the paper deals with logical formulas and Boolean terms, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
