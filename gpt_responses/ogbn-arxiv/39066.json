The algorithms involve regret minimization, which is a common technique in game theory (cs.GT). The paper also introduces novel variants of the algorithms, which could be considered a form of machine learning (cs.LG). The algorithms involve iterative updates, which could be analyzed using techniques from optimization and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses compatibility with pruning and sampling techniques, which could be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
