The paper is likely to be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it deals with the concept of explainable AI. It also discusses user-driven explanations, which falls under the category of Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). The paper also mentions mathematical analysis of algorithmic mechanisms, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper talks about comprehensible systems that emit symbols, which is related to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
