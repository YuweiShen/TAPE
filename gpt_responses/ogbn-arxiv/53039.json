The proposed algorithm involves statistical tests and model selection, which are also relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the algorithm on public datasets, which is a common practice in graphics (cs.GR) and computer vision (cs.CV) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
