It also involves convex programming and value function approximation, which are common techniques in machine learning. Additionally, the paper may also be relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Robotics (cs.RO) categories as it deals with decision-making under uncertainty, which is a common problem in these fields. The paper may also be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category as it involves designing controllers that can handle risk. Finally, the paper may be relevant to the Game Theory (cs.GT) category as it deals with optimizing policies in the presence of risk, which is a common problem in game theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
