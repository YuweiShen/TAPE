This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the privacy implications of the underlying optimization problems. This falls under the domain of computers and society.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a concept of ECO-driving and discusses distributed algorithms to realize it. This involves optimization and control, which are often addressed using machine learning techniques.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses a concept of ECO-driving and proposes distributed algorithms to realize it. This involves optimization and control, which are often addressed using artificial intelligence techniques.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes distributed algorithms to realize the ECO-driving concept.
