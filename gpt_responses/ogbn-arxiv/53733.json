Additionally, the paper also involves the use of neural networks, which falls under the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves testing and measuring the performance of the models, which falls under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The use of auxiliary languages and the study on paraphrase generation also suggests that the paper may belong to the category of Neural Networks (cs.NE) and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
