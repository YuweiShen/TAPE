The paper presents new results for Dyck reachability problems with applications to alias analysis and data-dependence analysis. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.PL (Programming Languages), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with optimization and complexity analysis, which makes cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity) likely sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
