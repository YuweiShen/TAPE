This falls under the scope of information theory. \n2. cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with communication systems and proposes a modulation scheme for a specific type of system. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses a system with a single transmitter and a large number of antennas at the receiver, and proposes a modulation scheme for this system. This falls under the scope of systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the performance of different modulation schemes in terms of symbol error rate, which is a key metric in multimedia applications. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses a communication system and proposes a modulation scheme for it, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
