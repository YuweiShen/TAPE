The primary focus is on computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) as the paper deals with image processing and analysis. The use of deep learning methods also suggests that machine learning (cs.LG) is a likely sub-category. The paper also deals with security and cryptography (cs.CR) as it involves ID documents and face verification. Finally, information retrieval (cs.IR) is also a possible sub-category as the paper deals with data standardization techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
