This involves analyzing video motion and camera movement to authenticate the video. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are Multimedia (cs.MM) and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV). The paper also discusses attacks on liveness verification solutions, which falls under the sub-category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper mentions the integration of the solution into mobile video capture applications, which relates to Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper involves the annotation of video motion categories, which is related to Information Retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
