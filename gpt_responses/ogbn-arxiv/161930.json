This is a problem that is commonly studied in the fields of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG), as well as in control theory (cs.SY), mathematical optimization (cs.MA), and robotics (cs.RO). The paper's focus on the discounted cost criterion further suggests that it may be more relevant to the optimization and control subfields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
