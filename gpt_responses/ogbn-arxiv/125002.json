The framework also involves spatiotemporal modeling (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) to generate realistic multi-agent trajectories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of weak supervision (cs.SD) to train the models. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.LG and cs.AI, followed by cs.CV, cs.GR, and cs.SD."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
