The paper also proposes a new strategy for anchor-based single-stage face detection, which involves machine learning techniques, so it could also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper presents experimental results on various datasets, which could make it relevant to the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of existing face detectors, which could make it relevant to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category, as face detection is often used in security applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
