The use of social-psychological theory to ground the development of these agents suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of social and information sciences (cs.SI). The paper also discusses decision theoretic reasoning and exploration strategies in reinforcement learning, which are topics commonly found in the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and cyber security (cs.CYBER). Finally, the paper explores the role of affective alignment in human social interactions, which falls under the sub-category of social computing (cs.SOC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
