The focus is on reducing subpacketization, which is a key challenge in coded caching, making cs.SI (signal processing) and cs.NI (networking and internet architecture) also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a technique for constructing new schemes from known ones, which falls under cs.CC (computational complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
