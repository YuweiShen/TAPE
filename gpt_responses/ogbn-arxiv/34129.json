The proposed method involves the use of a Face Recovery Network (FRN) and a Discriminative Network (DN) to incorporate facial attribute vectors and enforce the generation of authentic face images with corresponding attributes. This task falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category, and the use of deep learning models for image generation and attribute manipulation suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the preservation of identities and the use of convolutional and fully-connected layers suggest the involvement of graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
