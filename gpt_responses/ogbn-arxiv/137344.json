The use of convolutional neural networks to learn search heuristics from environment images suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the real-time constraints of the problem may also indicate a connection to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
