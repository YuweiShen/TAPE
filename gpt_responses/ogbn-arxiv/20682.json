The use of Hadamard and Fourier transforms suggests a connection to signal processing (cs.SP), while the focus on computational efficiency suggests a connection to numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the use of orthonormal matrices and sparsity suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
