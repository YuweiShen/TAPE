The paper establishes performance guarantees for total variation minimization in recovering one-dimensional signals with sparse gradient support, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SP) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also extends the results to multidimensional signals, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV) or numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the stability of recovering signals using total variation minimization, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
