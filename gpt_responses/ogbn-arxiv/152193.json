Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes to use machine learning techniques, such as multiple kernel learning, to solve the problem, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely category. Additionally, the paper suggests using responses of a recently proposed filterbank of object detectors, which is a semantic high-level feature, indicating that the paper may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of machine learning and object detection also suggests that the paper may belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
