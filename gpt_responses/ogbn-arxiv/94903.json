The paper also emphasizes the need for testing in realistic detail under a broad range of circumstances, which suggests a focus on human factors and human-robot interaction (cs.HC). The use of Coverage-Driven Verification (CDV) is proposed, which is a technique commonly used in software engineering (cs.SE) and system design (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the potential benefits of transferring this approach to the field of artificial intelligence, which suggests a focus on machine learning and decision-making algorithms (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
