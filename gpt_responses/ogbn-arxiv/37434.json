The topic of distributed transactions is typically studied in the Distributed Computing (cs.DC) and Database (cs.DB) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the performance of the protocol under different workloads, which falls under the category of Performance (cs.CR) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes a new protocol for highly-available systems, which falls under the category of Software Engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
