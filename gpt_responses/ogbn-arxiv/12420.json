The method involves constructing an And-Or graph (AOG) to represent the mined patterns, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning and computer vision (cs.LG). The paper also mentions using active human-computer communications to mine patterns, which involves natural language processing and potentially human-computer interaction (cs.CL). Finally, the paper involves training the CNN to improve its performance, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
