This involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) for inference in MRFs. The algorithm also involves message-passing implementation (cs.IT) and self-avoiding walk of graph (cs.CG). The paper also discusses computational complexity and bounds (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
