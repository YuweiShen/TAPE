The method is based on maximizing mutual information between local patches and the global representation of the entire graph. This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and specifically deals with network analysis (cs.SI) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of attention mechanisms (cs.AI) and regularization frameworks (cs.SD) in the proposed method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
