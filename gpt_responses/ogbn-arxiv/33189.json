Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related topics. The paper also mentions various deep learning architectures, indicating a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Information retrieval (cs.IR) is also relevant as the paper discusses creating and releasing a QA corpus. Finally, neural networks (cs.NE) are mentioned as a technology used in the experiments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
