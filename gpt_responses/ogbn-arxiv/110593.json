This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, which is a fundamental problem in reinforcement learning and falls under the category of decision making (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the concurrent setting, which falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
