This involves designing features that reflect the factors influencing the human reward function and learning the corresponding weights. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): IRL is a machine learning technique that falls under the AI umbrella. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves learning a reward function from data, which is a common task in machine learning. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper aims to understand real human decision making under risk, which is a topic of interest in HCI. \n- cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity): The paper mentions the importance of interpreting the human psychological process in risk decision-making, which could have implications for cybersecurity. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper involves modeling human decision-making behavior, which is a topic that could be relevant to social and information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
