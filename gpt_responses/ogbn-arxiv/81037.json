The paper also extensively uses deep learning techniques, which makes it likely to be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as well. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of end-to-end joint training strategy, which is a common technique in neural networks and could lead to categorization under neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions the speed of the proposed method, which could lead to categorization under multimedia (cs.MM) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
