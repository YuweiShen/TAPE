The paper uses neural networks and weak supervision to identify salient opinions and form extractive summaries. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques for identifying relevant opinions, which makes cs.IR a likely sub-category as well. The use of neural networks and machine learning also suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves human evaluation of the generated summaries, which suggests cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
