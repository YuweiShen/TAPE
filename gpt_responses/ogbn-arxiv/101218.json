The presence of adversarial agents in the network also brings in the aspect of control and system dynamics (cs.SY). The paper proposes a distributed algorithm, which involves communication and coordination among agents, making it relevant to multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
