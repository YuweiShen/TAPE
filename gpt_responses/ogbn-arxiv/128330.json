This falls under the domain of Human-Computer Interaction. \n3. cs.RO (Robotics): The system can be used to control robotic devices for assisting the elder and sick people. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The system uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for gesture recognition. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): ANNs are a type of machine learning algorithm, and the paper mentions the use of ANNs for gesture recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
