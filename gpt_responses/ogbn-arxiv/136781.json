This falls under the domain of social sensing, which is a subfield of social computing. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Other likely categories include cs.SD (Software Engineering), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.CY (Computers and Society), and cs.MM (Multimedia). These categories are relevant because the paper involves the development of a lightweight methodology for group detection, which requires the use of network science, unsupervised learning, and signal processing techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
