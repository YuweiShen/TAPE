The approach proposed in the paper involves the use of spatial stream segregation to produce probabilistic time-frequency masks for individual sources attributable to separate locations, enabling segregated sound event detection operating on these streams. This work involves the integration of multiple areas of computer science, including signal processing, robotics, and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.SD (Sound), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
