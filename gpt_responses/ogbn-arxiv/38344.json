This involves encryption, secret sharing, and blockchain technology, which are all related to cryptography and security. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The proposed solution involves a distributed hash table network and blockchain network, which are related to distributed computing. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes the use of Shamir's secret sharing scheme to split the secret keys of each file, which is related to data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.DB (Databases): The paper proposes a solution to manage a shared data pool on base of P2P technology with unrestricted access to files but where access to a file has to be recorded due to legal or billing reasons, which is related to database management. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The proposed solution involves the development of a software system that combines different technologies (distributed hash table network, Shamir's secret sharing scheme, and blockchain network) to address a specific problem, which is related to software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
