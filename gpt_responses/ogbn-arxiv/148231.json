This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The use of deep metric functions and regularization techniques also suggests the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of label noise, which could also place it in the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
