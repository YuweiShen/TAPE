The paper also uses simulation studies on real-world network datasets, which involves data analysis and statistics (cs.SD). The paper also discusses the independent cascade model, which is a common model used in social network analysis (cs.SOC). The paper also uses various values of seeding budgets, which involves optimization and decision-making (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the adaptability advantage of more phases, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
