The paper also mentions the Lasserre hierarchy, which is a common tool in computational complexity and optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT), computational geometry (cs.CG), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM), which are all relevant to the topic."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
