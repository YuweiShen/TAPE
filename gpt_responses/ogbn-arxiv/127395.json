This problem is a key concern in the field of multi-agent systems, which falls under the category of cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). The paper also proposes a novel off-policy RL algorithm to learn the solutions of the game algebraic Riccati equations arising from solving the H-infinity control problem, which is a key problem in the field of control theory, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also proposes a distributed control framework that uses RL to learn optimal control protocols for both homogeneous and heterogeneous multi-agent systems, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also proposes a distributed observer to estimate the leader state using only local information, which falls under the category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper proposes a distributed H-infinity control protocol to attenuate the effect of adversarial inputs on the compromised agent, which falls under the category of cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
