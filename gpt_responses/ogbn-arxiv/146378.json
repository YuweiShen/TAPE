Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes a novel beam search algorithm and strategies for parameter optimization, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed model can be applied to both LSTM and self-attention networks, which are commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) and neural machine translation (cs.NE). Finally, the paper also mentions experiments on abstractive summarization, which is related to computer vision (cs.CV) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
