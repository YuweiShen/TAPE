The paper proposes a nonconvex formulation for this problem, which is likely to fall under the categories of information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), signal processing (cs.SP), and multimedia (cs.MM). The specific applications mentioned in the abstract, such as image inpainting and restoration, also suggest that cs.CV and cs.MM are likely categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
