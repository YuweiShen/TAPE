The paper also mentions the use of deep Q-learning and a novel dense ranking-based reward. Given these keywords, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) are also possible sub-categories given the focus on video summarisation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
