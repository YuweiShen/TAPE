The paper also discusses the architecture and optimization of prediction serving systems, which could be categorized under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SE (Software Engineering). Additionally, the experiments conducted in the paper involve measuring performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and memory footprint, which could be classified under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
