The paper also discusses equilibria and strategic complementarities, which are concepts from game theory. \n2. cs.EC (Economics and Computation): The paper discusses the effect of the money supply on social welfare and the presence of altruists and hoarders on the performance of the system, which are topics related to economics and computation. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the behavior of agents in a system and how their characteristics can be inferred from the equilibrium distribution of money, which is related to social and information networks. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper provides new technical tools for analyzing and computing equilibria, which may be of interest to researchers in data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the efficiency of computing equilibria in the model and shows that there exist equilibria in pure strategies that can be computed efficiently, which may be of interest to researchers in computational complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
