The use of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the normalized covariance matrix suggests a focus on linear algebra and matrix theory, which is often used in machine learning and statistical analysis. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.STAT (Statistics) and cs.IT (Information Theory). The use of hypothesis testing and bootstrap methods suggests a focus on data analysis and experimental design, which could also place the paper in the sub-categories of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
