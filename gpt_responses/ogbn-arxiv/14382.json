The paper also mentions the applications of deep neural networks in image classification (cs.CV) and learning-based control (cs.SY), which further supports the likelihood of these sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the nonlinearity of activation functions, which is a topic that falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
