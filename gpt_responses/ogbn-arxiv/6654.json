The paper also uses techniques from graph theory (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT) to derive its results. Additionally, the paper discusses applications of its results to restricted classes of hypergraph parameters, which could fall under the category of graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
