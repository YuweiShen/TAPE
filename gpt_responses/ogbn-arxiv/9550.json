The paper proposes a multi-layered synergistic framework that generates dynamically-feasible and collision-free motion trajectories to achieve high-level mission specifications expressed in linear temporal logic. The paper also introduces a verifiable motion controller that can be incrementally composed to guarantee safe motion planning for each high-level induced task. Given the focus on robotics and motion planning, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) for the use of temporal logic in mission planning, cs.SY (Systems and Control) for the development of a multi-layered framework, cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) for the consideration of other agents in the workspace, and cs.PL (Programming Languages) for the use of symbolic two-player games in mission planning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
