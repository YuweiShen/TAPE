The use of semantic attributes for retrieval feature learning suggests that the paper may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. The large-scale dataset and the use of deep learning techniques for feature learning suggest that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories.
