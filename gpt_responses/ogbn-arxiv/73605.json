The paper discusses the application of statistical testing frameworks to the Monte Carlo and sensor fusion settings. The paper also presents a synthetic freeway traffic state estimation problem where the filters are able to reject simulated faulty GNSS measurements. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SE (Software Engineering), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
