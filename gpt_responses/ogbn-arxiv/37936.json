This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including social media (cs.SOC), information retrieval (cs.IR), cybersecurity (cs.CYBER), and multimedia (cs.MM) due to the use of large datasets and mining techniques. However, the focus on measuring and quantifying social bubbles and polarization makes the sub-category of social influence (cs.SI) the most likely fit for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
