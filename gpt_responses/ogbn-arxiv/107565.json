The proposed approach is based on sensorimotor contingencies theory, which is a concept in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of the approach is focused on the discovery of a visual field, which is a topic in computer vision (cs.CV). The approach involves capturing sensorimotor regularities, which can be modeled using neural networks (cs.NE) or machine learning techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
