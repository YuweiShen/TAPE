This falls under the category of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.LG: The proposed system uses deep reinforcement learning to learn the deck search policy. This falls under the category of machine learning.\n- cs.GT: The paper discusses the goal of deck building, which is to choose a subset of cards that work well together in-game against specific opponents. This falls under the category of game theory.\n- cs.CV: Although not the main focus of the paper, the proposed system could potentially use computer vision techniques to analyze the cards and their attributes.\n- cs.GR: The paper discusses the problem of deck building in collectible card games, which falls under the category of graphics and multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
