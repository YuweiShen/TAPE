The use of primitive roots and Gauss periods suggests a number theory (cs.NT) perspective. The determination of the 2-adic complexity involves the study of the structure of the sequences, which could be of interest to the data structures (cs.DS) community. Finally, the application of the results to the design of cryptographic primitives suggests a potential interest to the security and privacy (cs.SI) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
