This involves evaluating the vulnerability of the system to signal spoofing attacks and developing algorithms to achieve the goal of an adversary traveling to alternate locations without being detected. This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also involves the use of algorithms (cs.AI) and information theory (cs.IT) to derive potential destinations for the attacker. Finally, the paper evaluates the impact of the attack using real-world and simulated driving traces, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
