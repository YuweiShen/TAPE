This involves analyzing the basic read and write bandwidth of Optane, comparing its performance with HDD, and studying its impact on the performance of a parallel file system. This work involves aspects of distributed computing (cs.DC), computer architecture (cs.AR), databases (cs.DB), operating systems (cs.OS), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). However, given the focus on HPC I/O workloads, distributed computing (cs.DC) is the most likely sub-category, followed by computer architecture (cs.AR) and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
