Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the optimization of hyper-parameters, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with handwritten characters, which could also fall under the category of natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
