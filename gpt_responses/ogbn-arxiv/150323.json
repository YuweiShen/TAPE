The paper also mentions the use of textual features, which falls under information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP). The paper also discusses the comparison of different pre-trained CNN architectures, which falls under computer architecture and computer networks (CR). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of different learning models, which falls under machine learning (LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
