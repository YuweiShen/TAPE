This problem is related to natural language processing and information retrieval, which are covered by the sub-categories of computational linguistics (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also proposes a sequence classification approach, which involves modeling the dependencies between adjacent textual fragments, and this is a common technique in deep learning and neural networks, which are covered by the sub-category of deep learning (cs.DL). Finally, the problem of citation span determination is related to the problem of entity linking, which involves identifying and linking named entities in text to their corresponding Wikipedia pages, and this is covered by the sub-category of databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
