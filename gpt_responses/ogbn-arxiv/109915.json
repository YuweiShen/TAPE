The paper proposes a new routing paradigm and a new coding scheme, both of which are based on information theoretic principles. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with routing in a network with multiple sinks, which is a core problem in networking. The paper proposes a new routing paradigm that is different from conventional routing methods, and demonstrates that it offers better performance. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with communication over a network, which is a core problem in social and information networks. The paper proposes a new routing paradigm that is tailored to the problem of joint distributed source coding and routing, and demonstrates that it offers better performance. \n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper deals with distributed source coding and routing, which are core problems in distributed computing. The paper proposes a new routing paradigm that is tailored to the problem of joint distributed source coding and routing, and demonstrates that it offers better performance. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the problem of minimum cost communication of correlated sources, which is a core problem in multimedia.
