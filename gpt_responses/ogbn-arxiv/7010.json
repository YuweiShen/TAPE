The objective is to identify graspable regions and detect suitable grasp poses from a single view, possibly, partial 3D point cloud without any apriori knowledge of the object geometry. This problem is highly relevant to the field of robotics and hence, it is likely that this paper belongs to the cs.RO sub-category. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper uses 3D point cloud data obtained from a range or an RGBD sensor to identify and segment various object surfaces and search for suitable grasping handles on these surfaces by applying geometric constraints of the physical gripper. This involves the use of computer vision techniques and hence, it is likely that this paper belongs to the cs.CV sub-category. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel algorithm for robust grasping in extreme clutter environment. The algorithm involves identifying and segmenting various object surfaces and searching for suitable grasping handles on these surfaces by applying geometric constraints of the physical gripper. This involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques and hence, it is likely that this paper belongs to the cs.AI sub-category. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel algorithm for"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
