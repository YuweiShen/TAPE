Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of game-based abstraction to tackle the computational intractability of POMDPs, which suggests that cs.GT (Game Theory) is another likely sub-category. The paper also mentions safety and performance specifications, which are relevant to cs.RO (Robotics). The use of abstraction to transform POMDPs into probabilistic two-player games also suggests that cs.SY (Systems and Control) is a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of efficient verification tools, which suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) is another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
