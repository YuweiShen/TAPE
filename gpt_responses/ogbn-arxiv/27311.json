The paper also focuses on reducing computation complexity, which suggests that it may belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses quantization of filter kernels and weighting matrices, which suggests that it may belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the potential for mobile devices to accurately classify images, which suggests that it may belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
