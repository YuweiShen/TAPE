This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of random reshuffling in data sampling, which is relevant to data science (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of these algorithms in computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
