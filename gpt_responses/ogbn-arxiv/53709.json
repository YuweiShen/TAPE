The authors also mention the use of signal-dependent noise and in-camera signal processing pipeline, which suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM). The paper proposes a new training method for the neural network, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions a noise estimation subnetwork, which could also relate to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
