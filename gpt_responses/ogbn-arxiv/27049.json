This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories, including computational geometry (cs.CG), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), graphics (cs.GR), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and social and information networks (cs.SI). However, since the paper focuses on practical applications and software tools rather than theoretical aspects, cs.CG and cs.DS may be less likely than the other three categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
