The use of finite alphabets and pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) symbols suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.SI) and networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper may also touch on machine learning (cs.LG) as it discusses improving detection performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
