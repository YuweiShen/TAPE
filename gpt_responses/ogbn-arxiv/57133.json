Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses discrete optimization, which suggests that it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper introduces a novel approach to analyze population scalability, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of EAs, which could also be relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
