This is a key concern in cryptography and security. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes two different spectrum sharing schemes, which involve power control and signal design. These are techniques commonly used in systems and control engineering. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper does not directly deal with multimedia, but it does consider the transmission of multiple signals over a wireless channel, which is a common problem in multimedia communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
