This falls under the category of hardware architecture.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): DCNNs are widely used in computer vision and pattern recognition tasks, and the paper specifically mentions the potential of SC-DCNNs for such applications.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper discusses the use of DCNNs, which are a type of neural network, and proposes a hardware implementation using SC, which can be considered a type of evolutionary computing.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the implementation of DCNNs on embedded/portable systems, which can be considered a type of control system. Additionally, the optimization of the implementation for area and power/energy consumption can also be considered a systems and control problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
