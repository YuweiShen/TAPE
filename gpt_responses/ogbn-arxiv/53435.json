Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the use of automated parameter tuning, which is a common topic in the field of artificial intelligence, suggesting cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as another likely category. The paper also provides a rigorous runtime analysis, which falls under the category of theoretical computer science, suggesting cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as likely categories. Finally, the paper discusses the use of population-based EAs, which is a common topic in the field of software engineering, suggesting cs.SE (Software Engineering) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
