The paper proposes a new loss function for training deep neural networks, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed method is evaluated on large-scale face verification and identification datasets, which involves multimedia processing (cs.MM) and potentially computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
