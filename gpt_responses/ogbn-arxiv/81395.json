The reduction and scan algorithms are commonly used in data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG) applications, which are also relevant to this paper. Finally, the use of Tensor Core Units (TCUs) is a technique for optimizing neural network training, which falls under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
