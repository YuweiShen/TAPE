The focus on computing smooth entropies could also place it in cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The mention of randomness extraction could make it relevant to cs.CR (Cryptography) as well. Finally, the study of n-fold product distributions could potentially place it in cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
