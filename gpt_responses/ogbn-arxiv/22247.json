Additionally, the paper uses computational analyses to compare the quality of post-edited translations against human translations, which falls under the scope of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) also likely sub-categories. \n\nFurthermore, the paper discusses the concept of translation universals and laws of translation, which could potentially fall under the sub-category cs.CY (Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing) that deals with the theoretical and computational aspects of language. Lastly, the paper also touches upon the productivity and efficiency of post-editing, which could be relevant to the sub-category cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) that focuses on the interaction between humans and computers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
