The focus is on active sequential learners, which are commonly used in human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also formulates the problem as a Markov decision process, which is a common tool in control theory and robotics (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
