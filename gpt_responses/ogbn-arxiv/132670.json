The paper proposes a cache-induced hierarchical cooperation scheme and associated cache content placement optimization algorithm, which involves designing a hierarchical structure for the network, and optimizing the placement of cache content. This involves aspects of distributed computing (cs.DC) and machine learning (cs.LG), as well as optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
