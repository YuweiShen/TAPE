This involves the use of multiple antennas at the mobile terminal and the serving femto-access point. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the optimization of radio resources for energy efficiency in offloading applications, which is a key aspect of networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper involves the optimization of communication strategies such as transmission power, rate, and precoder, which are key topics in information theory. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper deals with the offloading of computational tasks from mobile devices to femto-access points, which is a form of distributed computing. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper involves the optimization of a system (i.e., the joint use of radio and computational resources) for energy efficiency and latency constraints, which is a topic in systems and control. \n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper involves the use of multiple antennas at the mobile terminal and the serving femto-access point, which is a topic in hardware architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
