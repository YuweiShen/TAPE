The paper proposes a method for constructing \"feature clouds\" to expand the distribution of tail classes, which involves a learnable embedding augmentation perspective, suggesting that the paper may also fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper may be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) due to the applications of person re-identification and face recognition in these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
