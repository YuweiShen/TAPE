This involves processing and analyzing large amounts of data, which falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.NE, cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves for quantitative evaluation, which is a common technique in data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper also involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as it deals with detecting objects in noisy and interference-prone environments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
