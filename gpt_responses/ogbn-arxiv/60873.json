Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) a likely sub-category as well. Additionally, the paper uses structured knowledge to construct logical forms, which is related to knowledge representation and reasoning, making cs.CC (Computational Complexity) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on downstream tasks, which is related to information retrieval, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
