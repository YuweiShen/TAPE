The use of excluded minor graphs and the Graph Structure Theorem suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Graph Theory (cs.GT) sub-category. The paper's focus on communication complexity and network optimization suggests that it may also be relevant to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category.
