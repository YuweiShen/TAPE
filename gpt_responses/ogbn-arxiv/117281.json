The paper also discusses the challenges of less-constrained scenarios and the need for large-scale databases, which are relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. Finally, the paper proposes a deep learning-based approach for heart rate estimation, which is related to neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
