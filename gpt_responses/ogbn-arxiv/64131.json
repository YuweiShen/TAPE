The use of evolution strategies and policy search also suggests a focus on robotics and control (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper involves modeling and simulation, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the study of the effect of different arm morphologies on the emergence of proximodistal exploration suggests a focus on neural networks and computational neuroscience (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
