This involves the use of a computerised workflow management system that enforces authorisation policies and constraints. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Software Engineering (cs.SE), Cybersecurity (cs.CY), and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
