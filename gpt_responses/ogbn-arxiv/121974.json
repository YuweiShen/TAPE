The most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper focuses on developing a new training scheme for neural networks. The paper also discusses language modelling and image captioning tasks, which suggests that it could be categorized under cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper introduces a new benchmark for studying uncertainty in language models, which could place it under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
