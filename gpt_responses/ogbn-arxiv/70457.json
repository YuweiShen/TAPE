The paper proposes a distributed multi-objective power control scheme that adapts transmit power on dual connections with non-ideal backhaul links. This involves dealing with interference and backhaul load, which are topics that fall under the categories of networked systems (cs.NI), information theory (cs.IT), game theory (cs.GT), control systems (cs.SY), and multimedia (cs.MM). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
