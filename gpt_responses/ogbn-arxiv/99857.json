The paper involves the use of statistical models and inference techniques to capture the spatial-temporal correlation in the collected spectrum data. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper involves the use of statistical models and inference techniques to capture the spatial-temporal correlation in the collected spectrum data, which is related to information theory. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new framework based on Bayesian machine learning to cooperatively derive the global spectrum states. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a framework for spectrum sensing in a heterogeneous network, which is related to networking and internet architecture. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper involves the use of Bayesian inference to automatically infer the heterogeneous spectrum states, which is related to systems and control. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new algorithm with a refinement mechanism to predict the spectrum availability, which is related to artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
