This topic falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed methods are also evaluated on image classification tasks (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of cross-validation mechanisms to evaluate the generalization ability of binary SVMs, which is a common topic in neural networks (cs.NE) and statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
