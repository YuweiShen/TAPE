The use of probabilistic models and Bayesian inference suggests that the paper may belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) or machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of landmarks and the focus on accuracy and robustness suggest that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of flexible deformation models and the focus on optimization suggest that the paper may also belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) or multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
