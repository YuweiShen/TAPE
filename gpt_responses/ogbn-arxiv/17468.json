The paper also mentions the use of long-term predictions, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) or neural networks (cs.NE). The DCNN used in the paper is designed for image recognition, which could fall under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the game theory aspect of Go and the use of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which could fall under the category of game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
