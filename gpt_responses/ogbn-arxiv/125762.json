This falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with optimizing the performance of a communication system, which can be viewed as a control system. This falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
