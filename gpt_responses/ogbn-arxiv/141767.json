Specifically, it focuses on systems that have a weighted homogeneous structure, which is a common structure in many applications. Therefore, cs.SC (Symbolic Computation) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) are the most likely sub-categories, as they both cover topics related to computational algebraic geometry. \n\nAdditionally, the paper mentions the use of algorithms such as F 5 and FGLM, which are commonly used in computer science for solving polynomial systems, suggesting that cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) may also be a relevant sub-category. \n\nThe paper also includes experimental results based on systems arising from cryptography and polynomial inversion problems, which suggests that cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.IT (Information Theory) may also be relevant sub-categories, as these fields often involve solving polynomial systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
