The use of Random Forests and autoencoder networks for training and weighting the local expression predictions suggests a machine learning approach (cs.LG, cs.AI). The subjectivity of labelling expressions and the need for robustness in the face of occlusions suggest a human-computer interaction (cs.HC) aspect to the work. Finally, the use of high-level representations for describing facial expressions suggests a multimedia (cs.MM) aspect to the work."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
