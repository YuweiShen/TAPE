The use of feature point correspondences and triangulation techniques suggests that the paper belongs to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The mention of frame quantisation theory and half-space intersections suggests that the paper may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The use of consistent reconstruction and comparison with state-of-the-art techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The focus on error decay rate suggests that the paper may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the use of linear time-complexity suggests that the paper may also belong to the computational geometry (cs.CG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
