This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of neural networks, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of unsupervised learning is also mentioned, which falls under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category.
