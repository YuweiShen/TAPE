The concept of entropy density and its application to quantization is also relevant to statistical inference (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of source density mismatch on the quantization performance, which is a topic related to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
