The use of linear function spaces and geometric insights also suggests a focus on computer vision. It is also likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as the proposed method involves optimization and parameterization. The use of functional representation and optimization strategy also suggests a focus on data structures (cs.DS) and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
