The paper also discusses the social effects of biased recommendations, which falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI). The proposed debiasing strategies involve engineering solutions for recommender systems, which could be classified under cybernetics (cs.CY). Finally, the paper emphasizes the importance of understanding and dealing with bias in machine learning models that interact with humans, which is relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
