The paper also extends proof rules for classical probabilistic programs to purely quantum programs, which falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL). The paper deals with the quantum part of a potential quantum computer, which falls under the category of emerging technologies (cs.ET). The paper introduces denotational semantics, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE).
