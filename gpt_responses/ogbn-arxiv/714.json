The applications mentioned in the abstract (surveillance camera, intelligent robotics, and autonomous driving) also suggest that this paper could belong to the robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of deep learning also suggests that this paper could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the trade-off between speed and accuracy, which suggests that it could also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
