The paper also proposes an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) for this task, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The use of depthwise separable convolution to reduce model size and save inference time is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the application of this technique to mobile devices makes it relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
