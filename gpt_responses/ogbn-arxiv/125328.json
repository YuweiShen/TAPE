The use of stochastic geometry also suggests a possible category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The paper also discusses the use of beamforming and power allocation, which could fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper deals with the use of multiple antennas for spatial diversity and interference nulling, which could fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
