The design aims to improve computation progress and ensure data consistency without system suspension during runtime, which are key concerns in operating system design. \n\n2. cs.AR (Architecture): The paper proposes a novel design for failure-resilient intermittent systems that leverages the characteristics of data accessed in hybrid memory. This involves designing a hardware architecture that can support accumulative execution and instant system recovery under frequent power failures. \n\n3. cs.EM (Embedded Systems): The paper focuses on designing a self-powered intermittent system that can operate without a continuous power source. This is a key concern in embedded systems design, where devices may need to operate in remote or harsh environments with limited power sources. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents a design for a system that can recover from power failures and ensure data consistency without system suspension during runtime. This involves designing a control system that can manage the execution of concurrent tasks and ensure serializability. \n\n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the challenges of designing a system that can accumulate computation progress across power cycles and recover system status from power failures. This involves designing a distributed system that can manage the execution of tasks"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
