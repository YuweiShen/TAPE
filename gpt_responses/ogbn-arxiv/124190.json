The proposed algorithms use sparse dictionary-based methods and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of ASF estimation in various applications such as pilot decontamination and channel sounding, which are related to networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper provides numerical simulations to assess the performance of the proposed algorithms, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
