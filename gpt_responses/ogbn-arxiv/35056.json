The paper proposes two D2D clustering schemes for mitigating PRACH congestion, which involves the use of information theory and communication theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the implementation algorithm and potential implementation issues, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The paper presents a case study based on a stochastic geometry framework, which involves the use of mathematical modeling and simulation (cs.MM). Finally, the paper offers insights into useful scenarios that minimize the scheduling delay for each clustering scheme, which involves the use of data analysis and optimization (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
