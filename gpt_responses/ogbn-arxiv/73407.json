Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also focuses on the application of homography estimation in robotics, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.RO (Robotics). The use of deep learning models indicates that it could be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning), and the comparison with traditional methods suggests that it could also be classified under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the use of aerial images suggests that it could be categorized under cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
