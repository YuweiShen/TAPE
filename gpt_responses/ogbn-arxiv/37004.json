This involves techniques from computer vision (image-based shape optimization, multi-view 3D reconstruction, single-view 3D reconstruction), computer graphics (rendering of 3D shapes), machine learning (deep learning models), and optimization (multi-resolution strategy). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.GR (Computer Graphics), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
