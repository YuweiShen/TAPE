The paper also mentions the use of stochastic network calculus (cs.SY) and statistical characterization (cs.MM) in deriving measures of queuing performance. Additionally, the paper discusses interference-limited systems, which could fall under the category of physical-layer security (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
