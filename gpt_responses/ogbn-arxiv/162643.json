The paper evaluates five methods to score examples in a dataset and applies them to four common datasets in computer vision (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of their metrics on curriculum learning and adversarial robustness, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
