The use of convolutional context encoders and adversarial training suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of perceptual reconstruction losses and optimization-based refinement suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.
