Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses system-level design parameters and optimization techniques, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The use of 3D beamforming and enhanced support for UAVs could also relate to cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the deployment of UAVs as base-stations and user equipment, which could be relevant to cs.CE (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
