The paper also makes use of Lov\\'asz' and Gallager's ideas, which are well-known in the field of combinatorics and optimization (cs.DS, cs.CC). The paper's focus on bounding the probability of error suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of coding theory (cs.SI), while the use of expurgated coefficients suggests a connection to network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
