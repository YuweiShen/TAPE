The paper also mentions the use of minimal neural network architectures, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The application of the method in clinical research suggests a potential connection to computer engineering (cs.CE) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
