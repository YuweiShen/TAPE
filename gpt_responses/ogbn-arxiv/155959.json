Therefore, cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the compositional nature of the proof systems, which is related to programming languages and software engineering, making cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.SE (Software Engineering) likely sub-categories as well. The use of coinduction and induction in the proof systems also suggests cs.LT (Automata and Formal Languages) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper briefly mentions mechanisations in proof assistants, which could fall under cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
