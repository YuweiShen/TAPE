Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of heuristics and meta-heuristics, which are optimization techniques commonly used in the fields of computer architecture and engineering. This suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), cs.ET (Embedded Systems), and cs.EM (Electronics Materials), which are all related to hardware design and optimization. Finally, the paper involves the evaluation of the proposed methodology using realistic SNNs, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
