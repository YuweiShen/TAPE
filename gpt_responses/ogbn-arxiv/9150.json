This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of multiple antennas for data transmission and reception, which falls under the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The paper proposes fast-decodable codes, which can be useful for practical implementation, and this falls under the computer engineering (cs.CE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the NAF channel and the MAC-DMT, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
