The techniques used involve Fourier analysis, which is a common tool in the study of Boolean functions and is often used in the subfield of computational complexity known as circuit complexity (cs.CC). The paper also has applications to quantum communication complexity (cs.IT), secret sharing schemes (cs.DS), and certificate complexity (cs.DM), which are all related to the study of Boolean functions. Finally, the paper uses techniques from machine learning (cs.LG) to analyze the properties of the functions under consideration."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
