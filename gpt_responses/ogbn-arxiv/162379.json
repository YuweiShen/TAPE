The paper also discusses the connectivity, Hamiltonicity, and perfect-matching admissibility of the graphs, which are topics in graph theory (cs.GT). The paper also considers the problem of blocking the edges of the graph, which is related to graph drawing and network security (cs.SI). The concept of higher-order Delaunay graphs is also related to data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
