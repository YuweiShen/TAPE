The use of rate-splitting and successive decoding is a coding technique that is commonly used in wireless communication systems, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the properties of the channel to the receiver, which is a topic that is relevant to communication networks (cs.CC) and multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
