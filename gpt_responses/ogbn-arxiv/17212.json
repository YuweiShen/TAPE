The paper discusses the convergence of the proposed algorithm for convex and Lipschitz loss functions and provides a generalization bound on CVaR for nonconvex and smooth loss functions. The paper also conducts numerical experiments on various machine learning tasks. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.ST (Statistics), cs.ML (Machine Learning), and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
