Additionally, the paper suggests polished formulae for the learning rate of the covariance matrix and the recombination weights, which are commonly used in evolutionary algorithms. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as CMA-ES is often used in these fields for optimization tasks. \n\nThe Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category is also a possibility as CMA-ES has been applied to control problems in the past. \n\nFinally, the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category may be relevant as the paper discusses different adaptation strategies for optimizing the step-size in CMA-ES, which is a fundamental aspect of many optimization algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
