The proposed solution involves aligning power spectrum densities (PSDs) of different users, which is a signal processing technique that can be categorized under systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also focuses on the performance analysis of channel estimation, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implementation of the proposed solution, which can be categorized under computer networks and communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
