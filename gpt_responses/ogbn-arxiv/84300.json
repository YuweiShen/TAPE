The paper uses techniques from computational complexity theory, graph theory, and algebraic combinatorics. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.CG (Computational Geometry)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
