The use of global optimization and regular grids also suggests that it may be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper may be relevant to graphics (cs.GR) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories as optical flow estimation is important in these fields as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
