The paper also discusses the subjective uncertainty in making judgments, which is a topic in human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The proposed indicator involves assigning unique weights to each image pair, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper validates the applicability of the proposed indicator for both degraded and enhanced image data, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
