The use of nonlinear spectral methods suggests that the paper may belong to cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). However, the focus on training feedforward neural networks suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the mention of real-world datasets suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
