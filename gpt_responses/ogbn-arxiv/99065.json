Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the mathematical foundations of communication and information processing. The paper also involves network architecture and implementation, which falls under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The use of multiple antennas and spatial user multiplexing suggests cs.SI (Signal Processing) as another likely category. The paper also deals with improving spectral efficiency, which is a key aspect of cs.MM (Multimedia), and the use of distributed processing suggests cs.COM (Computers and Society) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
