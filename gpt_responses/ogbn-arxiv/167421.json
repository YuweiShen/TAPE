Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also presents a small core calculus to model serverless computing, which falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL). Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of writing and reasoning about code in serverless computing, which relates to software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also presents a key-value store to reason about stateful serverless functions, which falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses extending the core calculus with a composition language, which relates to computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
