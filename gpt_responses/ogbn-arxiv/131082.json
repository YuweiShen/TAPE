This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - Hyperspectral unmixing is also relevant in information retrieval, particularly in the analysis of remote sensing data. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The proposed method involves the use of machine learning techniques, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - Hyperspectral unmixing is also relevant in multimedia applications, such as image and video analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
