The use of spin locks to protect shared resources also relates to data structures (cs.DS) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the analysis of blocking time and its impact on task finishing time involves the study of algorithms and complexity (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
