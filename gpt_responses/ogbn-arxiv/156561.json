The proposed scheme involves watermarking of sequential data, which can be applied to various types of data, including genomic data and location patterns, indicating the relevance to databases (cs.DB). The optimization-based approach used in the proposed scheme suggests the involvement of machine learning and optimization techniques, which are commonly used in the field of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the utility loss that may occur due to watermarking, which relates to the field of cyber-physical systems (cs.CY). Finally, the proposed scheme aims to identify the source of unauthorized sharing, which involves the detection and attribution of faults, indicating the relevance to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
