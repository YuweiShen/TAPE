The paper also discusses the network architecture and trainable filter coefficients, which are key components of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the principle by which additional convolutional layers induce a group factorization, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of convolutions and pooling operators, which are common techniques in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses stable group invariance, which is a topic in statistical learning theory (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
