This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including social networks (cs.SI), cybersecurity (cs.CY), cryptography (cs.CR), natural language processing (cs.CL), and software engineering (cs.SD). The paper provides a typology of the false-information ecosystem and reviews existing research on the topic, which suggests a multidisciplinary approach to addressing the problem. Therefore, it is likely to be relevant to researchers in these sub-fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
