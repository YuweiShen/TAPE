Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), followed by cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also discusses the scalability and availability of the VPKI system, which suggests the possibility of it being categorized under cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.Distributed Systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
