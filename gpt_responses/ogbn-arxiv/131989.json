This topic falls under the intersection of several CS sub-categories, including information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), signal processing (cs.SP), numerical analysis (cs.NA), and multimedia (cs.MM). The use of non-convex optimization methods also suggests a focus on machine learning and optimization, which further supports the likelihood of cs.LG being a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
