Additionally, the use of WordNet, a lexical database for English, further supports this categorization. The paper also involves the use of deep convolutional neural networks trained with ImageNet, which suggests that it could also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of neural networks also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the proposed experiments to evaluate the performance of the distance measure suggest that it could also belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
