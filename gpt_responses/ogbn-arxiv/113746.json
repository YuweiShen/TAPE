This suggests the use of computer vision techniques for tracking and reconstruction. \n2. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper discusses the use of AI techniques to augment the amount of information that is made available for players, coaches, teams, and fans. This may involve the use of graphics to visualize the data. \n3. cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper may involve the development of software for tracking and processing the data. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with video data and may involve the use of multimedia techniques for processing and visualization. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper mentions the use of state-of-the-art AI techniques to augment the information available for players, coaches, teams, and fans."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
