The paper also discusses strategies for maximizing ER result quality while minimizing cost, which involves machine learning and optimization techniques (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper addresses the challenge of dealing with noisy input from crowd workers, which is a common issue in human-computer interaction research (cs.HC). The paper also discusses the use of synthetic and crowdsourced datasets, which falls under the category of cybernetics (cs.CY) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
