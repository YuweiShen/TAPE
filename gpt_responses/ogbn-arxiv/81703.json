The paper presents new deterministic algorithms that improve upon the previously fastest algorithm for solving parity games. The algorithms are based on techniques from graph theory, computational complexity, and parameterized algorithms. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
