This suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Communications (cs.COMM) sub-categories. The use of the Viterbi algorithm and decision feedback also suggests a focus on signal processing and data structures, which could place the paper in the Data Structures (cs.DS) or Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the coding scheme in terms of latency and throughput, which could suggest a focus on Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
