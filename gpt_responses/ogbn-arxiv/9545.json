Therefore, cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses interference nulling and system-level simulations, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM). The proposed coordinated coexistence scheme involves cooperation between neighboring networks, which can be considered as a system control problem (cs.SY). Finally, the paper also discusses the issue of coexistence and potential interference, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
