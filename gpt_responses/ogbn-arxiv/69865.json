Therefore, cs.IR and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel training scheme that involves learning from weakly annotated data, which is related to machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Hence, cs.LG and cs.AI are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the proposed framework involves image processing techniques for scoring the unlabeled data, which is related to computer vision (CV) techniques. Therefore, cs.CV is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
