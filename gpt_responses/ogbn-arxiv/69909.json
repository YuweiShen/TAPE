The paper also discusses the use of optimization primitives to access policy and value function classes, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with the challenges of tractable PAC RL in general settings, which is relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents sample-efficient algorithms, which involves analyzing the efficiency of algorithms, a topic that falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
