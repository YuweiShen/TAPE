The comparison of different architectures also involves message-passing schemes, which is a topic in computer science theory (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses computational and storage efficiency, which are important considerations in systems and networking (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
