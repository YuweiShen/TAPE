The most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning) as the paper focuses on learning a parameter transfer strategy. The paper also involves computer vision (cs.CV) as it experiments with various network architectures. Additionally, the paper involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it proposes a general and flexible module that can be used in both CNNs and RNNs. The paper also involves neural networks (cs.NE) as it proposes a parameter transfer unit that learns a fine-grained nonlinear combination of activations. Finally, the paper involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it experiments with multiple transfer domain pairs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
