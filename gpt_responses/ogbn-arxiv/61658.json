The proposed approach is data-driven and uses neural networks, which suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of sensor input, which could indicate a connection to computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper mentions the challenges of modeling complex traffic and dynamic uncertainties, which suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
