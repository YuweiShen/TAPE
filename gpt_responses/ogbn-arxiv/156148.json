The use of mobile LiDAR systems also suggests that it could belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of deep learning models, which could place it in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the focus on urban mapping and scene understanding could also suggest the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
