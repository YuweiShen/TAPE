The focus is on delay-limited codes, which are used for delay-sensitive applications such as voice and video (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the capacity-achieving property of these codes, which is a fundamental concept in information theory (cs.MM). Finally, the paper considers the effect of errors on the empirical output distribution, which is related to network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
