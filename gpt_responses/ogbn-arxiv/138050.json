The focus on incremental insertion and querying also suggests a potential fit with data structures (cs.DS). The use-case of malware analysis triage may also suggest a connection to computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the evaluation of different algorithms and metrics could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
