The use of FPQ-trees to encode hierarchical embedding constraints is a novel approach, which suggests that the paper may belong to the data structures (cs.DS) or computational geometry (cs.CG) categories. The paper also involves graph theory (cs.GT) and combinatorics (cs.DM) in its analysis. Finally, the application of the techniques to NodeTrix planarity testing of clustered graphs suggests that the paper may also belong to the complex systems (cs.CC) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
