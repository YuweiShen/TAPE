The most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), as the paper focuses on the semantic and syntactic features of texts. The second most likely sub-category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval), as text classification is an essential task in information retrieval. The third most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper discusses the use of metrics and algorithms to classify texts.
