The use of user selection algorithms also suggests a possible category of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also mentions beamforming vectors and power allocation scalars, which are common in multimedia systems (cs.MM). Finally, the study of performance comparison between different user selection algorithms could also fall under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
