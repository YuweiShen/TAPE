The use of multiantenna transmit-receive schemes and soft frequency reuse also suggests a potential overlap with information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM) subfields. The paper also mentions the consideration of power-efficient control mechanisms, which could fall under the systems and control (cs.SY) subfield. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed scheduling schemes in terms of fairness distribution among users could potentially relate to game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
