Therefore, it is likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the stability of the pursuit algorithm, which suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Additionally, the paper proposes an online algorithm for learning the dictionaries, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
