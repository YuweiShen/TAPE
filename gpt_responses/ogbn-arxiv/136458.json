The use of neural networks for this task also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The dataset used in the experiments is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and the paper discusses the optimization of a structured prediction objective, which is a common topic in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
