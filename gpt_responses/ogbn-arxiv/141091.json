This involves exploiting the rich semantics of KGs to produce interpretable explanations for the fact checking output. The paper also models the checking task as an inference problem in a probabilistic extension of answer set programs. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DB (Databases), followed by cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
