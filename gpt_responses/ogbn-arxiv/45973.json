This involves using a dynamic reward signal to improve the bot's accuracy and reduce predictability. This work involves artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, which are commonly found in the cs.AI and cs.LG sub-categories. Additionally, the paper may involve computer graphics (cs.GR) and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques for visual perception and aiming. Finally, the use of game theory (cs.GT) may also be relevant for analyzing the strategic interactions between human players and bots in the game."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
