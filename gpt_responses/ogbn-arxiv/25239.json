Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also introduces a stopping problem and stopping rules, which are related to decision-making and optimization, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of feature vector-quantization and difficulty measurement could also place it in cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper proposes a method to reduce computational cost, which could be relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
