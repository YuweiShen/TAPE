This paper focuses on enabling users to create effective task plans for collaborative robots, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The study also involves evaluating the usability of the system, which relates to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of SmartMoves and perception-driven task plans also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the study involves pick-and-place assembly tasks, which may involve computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
