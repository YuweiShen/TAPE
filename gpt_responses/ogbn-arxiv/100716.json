The paper proposes new techniques for modeling object deformations and optimizing classifiers at different difficulty levels, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the architecture and training strategies of the deep neural networks, which are related to neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
