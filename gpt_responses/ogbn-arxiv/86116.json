The paper also discusses the validity of these inequalities in practical applications, which could fall under computer security (cs.CR) or machine learning (cs.LG). The use of asymptotic analysis in the paper suggests a possible connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), while the focus on information theory could also place it in the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
