The use of interference (pre-)subtraction and decision feedback equalization (DFE) or Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The development of a unified framework for joint transceiver design may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
