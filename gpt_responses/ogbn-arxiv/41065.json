The use of polynomial codes to lower computational time is a technique often used in distributed computing (cs.DC) and the analysis of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the problem of matrix multiplication is a fundamental problem in computer science and is often studied in the context of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
