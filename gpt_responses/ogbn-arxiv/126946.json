The paper also addresses the challenge of generalization, which is a common problem in machine learning and falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper uses a stochastic policy to learn from demonstrations, which is a common technique in reinforcement learning and falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also uses computer vision techniques to process visual input from the robot, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with real-world robotic manipulation tasks, which involves control systems and falls under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
