This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The algorithm is also a form of control system, which could be classified under systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also mentions spatial multiplexing, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
