The proposed solution involves training a Restricted Boltzmann Machine with an adapted algorithm based on mean-field equations to efficiently solve problems of inductive and transductive learning in which both features and labels are missing at random. This approach falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), cybersecurity (cs.CR), sensor networks (cs.SI), and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
