The focus on reliability and the stochastic nature of energy harvesting also suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY). The use of optimization techniques and decision-making algorithms points towards information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.MA). Finally, the use of linear value approximation and online learning techniques suggests a connection to statistical learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
