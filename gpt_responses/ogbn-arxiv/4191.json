The paper also discusses the use of these distributions in reducing computational complexity, which could fall under numerical analysis (cs.NA) or signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper compares 2-dimensional and 4-dimensional distributions, which could be considered a problem in data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
