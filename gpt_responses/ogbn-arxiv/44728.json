This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Graphics (cs.GR) for the VR video content, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) for the use of convolutional autoencoder, Multimedia (cs.MM) for the spatio-temporal features, Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) for the focus on VR sickness and viewing safety, and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) for the development of an objective assessment method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
