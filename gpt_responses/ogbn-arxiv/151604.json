The study is empirical and focuses on the training techniques used in deep learning (cs.LG) such as adaptive gradient descent and L2 regularization. The paper also discusses the emergence and pruning of selective features, which is related to the field of neural engineering (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
