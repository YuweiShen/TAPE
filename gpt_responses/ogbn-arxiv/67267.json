It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as camera motion estimation is a crucial component of robotic navigation. Additionally, the paper uses unsupervised learning, which is a popular topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to graphics (cs.GR) as it involves view synthesis, which is a common task in computer graphics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
