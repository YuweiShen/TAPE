The paper also explores model-free and partially model-based approaches, which are common in the field of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses cooperative and antagonistic settings, which are relevant to the field of multiagent systems (cs.MA). The use of reinforcement learning in searching for optima in realistic and latent model environments also suggests a connection to the field of control systems (cs.SY) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
