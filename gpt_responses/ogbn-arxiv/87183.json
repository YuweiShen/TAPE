Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel normalization method, which could fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions three different visual recognition problems, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with gradient variation, which could also fall under neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
