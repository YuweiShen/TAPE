The paper discusses the optimization of user grouping for two different objectives, which involves graph-theoretic frameworks. These topics are closely related to the fields of information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), signal processing (cs.SI), multimedia (cs.MM), and computer communications (cs.COM).
