Given the focus on language and cultural aspects, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper draws parallels with archives and libraries, which suggests that it could also be relevant to cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses the need for institutional frameworks and procedures, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
