This suggests that the paper may belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms category.\n2. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The open shop problem is a well-known problem in discrete mathematics, and the paper proposes a fixed parameter algorithm to solve a variant of the problem. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Discrete Mathematics category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an algorithm to solve a scheduling problem, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Artificial Intelligence category.\n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper proposes an algorithm with a time complexity of $2^{O(gm^2\\log gm)}+O(mn\\log n)$, which suggests that the paper may belong to the Computational Complexity category.\n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The open shop problem is a scheduling problem that is commonly encountered in robotics, and the paper proposes an algorithm to solve a variant of the problem.
