The authors also use mathematical tools such as modular arithmetic and polynomial algebra, which are relevant to computer science theory (cs.DS) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the Legendre symbol is a concept from number theory (cs.NT), which further supports the inclusion of this paper in these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
