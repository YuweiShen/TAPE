The algorithm also involves sampling and coordinate changes, which are common techniques in computer vision (cs.CV) and computational geometry (cs.CG). The use of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms and sampling charts also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
