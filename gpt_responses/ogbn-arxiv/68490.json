It also proposes a new metric, Graded Average Precision, for assessing the quality of ranked results list for graded relevance. \n\nIt could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a latent factor model, GAPfm, for optimizing Graded Average Precision. \n\nArtificial Intelligence (cs.AI) is another likely sub-category as recommender systems are a common application of AI. \n\nData Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) could also be a relevant sub-category as the paper proposes a fast learning algorithm that uses an adaptive item selection strategy to ensure scalability to large data sets. \n\nFinally, the paper could belong to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category as recommender systems are often used in social networks to suggest friends or content to users."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
