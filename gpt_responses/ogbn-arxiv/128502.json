This is a subfield of artificial intelligence and hence falls under this category.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with state-space models and nonlinear dynamical systems. This is a subfield of systems and control and hence falls under this category.\n4. cs.ST (Statistics): The paper deals with Bayesian learning and inference techniques for state-space models. This is a subfield of statistics and hence falls under this category.\n5. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the trade-off between model capacity and computational cost.
