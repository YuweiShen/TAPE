The use of a quantitative metric and comparison with conventional steganalysis methods suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.MM) and statistical learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of adaptive pixel-level removal suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
