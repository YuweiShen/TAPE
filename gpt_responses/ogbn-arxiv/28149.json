Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-category of Computation and Language (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper compares a newly emerging text classification method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a well-established conventional method using linguistic knowledge, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves building a presentation corpus, which could fall under the sub-category of Sound (cs.SD). Finally, the paper discusses the use of lexical cues for humor recognition, which could be relevant to the sub-category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
