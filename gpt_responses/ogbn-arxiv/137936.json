The use of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for modelling colour distributions is a common technique in computer vision and machine learning, which suggests that the paper could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) or cs.MM (Multimedia). The use of non-linear parametric transfer functions and the ability to store them for later usage suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of parallel processing architectures for efficient recolouring suggests that the paper could belong to cs.GR (Graphics) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
