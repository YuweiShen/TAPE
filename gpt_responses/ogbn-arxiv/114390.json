This is a common problem in machine learning, which suggests that the paper is likely to be in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions applications in meta-learning, unrolled optimization, reinforcement learning, and synthetic gradients, which are all sub-fields of machine learning. Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a search distribution for evolutionary strategies, which suggests that it could be in the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. Finally, the paper applies the method to example problems in computer vision, which suggests that it could also be in the cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
