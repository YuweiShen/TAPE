The concept of Schnyder woods is also related to graph theory (cs.GT) and the paper proves several properties on this object, which could fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the use of these concepts to obtain straight-line representations, which could be considered a topic in computer graphics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
