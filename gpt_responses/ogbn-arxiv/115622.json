The focus on reliability and uncertainty estimations suggests a potential fit for the sub-categories of multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of dropout and predictive distribution estimation for inference operations suggests a potential fit for the sub-category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
