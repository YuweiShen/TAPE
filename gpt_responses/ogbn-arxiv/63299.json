This involves optimizing the transmit power allocation and the IRS passive array reflection coefficients to maximize the achievable rate. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper studies the use of IRS for enhancing wireless communication systems and proposes a practical transmission protocol with channel estimation to reduce the overhead in training and estimation. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution for the non-convex optimization problem of joint power allocation and passive array coefficients optimization. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper considers an OFDM system, which is commonly used for multimedia communication, and proposes a design that significantly improves the link rate performance. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): This category is less likely, but the paper does involve some mathematical optimization and signal processing techniques, which could be relevant to natural language processing applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
