The paper also uses constraint programming, which is a technique commonly used in combinatorial optimization problems in computer science (cs.DS). The evaluation of the approach includes metrics such as speed and code size, which are commonly used in machine learning and data mining (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implementation of the approach, which falls under software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
