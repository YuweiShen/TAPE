This involves designing behavior that is engaging and robust to perturbations induced by human interaction. The paper uses predictive information maximization as an intrinsic motivation and presents a game-like study design to focus on the interplay between the robot and the human participant. The study involves interaction with a fully autonomous robot and a quantitative analysis of post-interaction questionnaires. The paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories as it involves designing autonomous robots, evaluating their behavior, and studying their interaction with humans."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
