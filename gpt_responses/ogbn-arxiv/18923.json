The use of measurement procedures and data analysis techniques also suggests a focus on information science and digital libraries (cs.SI, cs.DL). The mention of a design flaw and correction implies a focus on computational systems and algorithms (cs.CY, cs.SD). Finally, the use of citation networks and analysis of scientific publications suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
