The paper also introduces a new method for solving the discrete back propagation problem, which is a common issue in neural networks and falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of multiple projections to compress full-precision kernels, which involves optimization techniques and falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on image datasets, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
