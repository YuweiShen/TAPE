Therefore, cs.SD is a likely sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a semi-supervised learning approach to extract style embeddings and train a multi-style TTS system. This falls under the scope of machine learning and makes cs.LG a likely sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with developing a controllable multi-style TTS system, which involves AI techniques such as style transfer learning and emotion recognition. Therefore, cs.AI is a possible sub-category.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper uses the interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database (IEMOCAP) for style model training, which is a dataset of social interactions. Therefore, cs.SI is a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
