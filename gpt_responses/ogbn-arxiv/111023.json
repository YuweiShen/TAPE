The paper also presents algorithmic concepts and techniques for automated generation of free-space polygons, model-based planning, and trajectory optimization, which are all related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of numerical simulations, which suggests the possibility of computer vision (cs.CV) being involved. The paper also discusses the ability to make fast decisions and execute them using control commands, which falls under the field of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the efficiency and robustness of the proposed methods, which suggests the possibility of machine learning (cs.LG) being involved."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
