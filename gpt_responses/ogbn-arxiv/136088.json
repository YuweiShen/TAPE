The model involves the use of a tensor to represent the input traffic status, a multidimensional boolean vector for the control policy, and a multi-task learning structure for cooperative policy learning. The paper also discusses the use of proximal policy optimization algorithm to solve the policy collapse problem in multi-dimensional output situation. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
