The use of projective geometries over finite fields suggests a connection to algebraic coding theory, which is also a subfield of information theory. The paper also involves the construction of new coded caching schemes, which could fall under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The application of the proposed schemes to multi-receiver settings such as D2D communications, distributed computing, and the cache-aided interference channel suggests a connection to networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper involves the analysis of lower bounds on the optimal rate of coded caching, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
