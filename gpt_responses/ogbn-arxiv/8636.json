The focus on bipartite regular graphs and Poisson-distributed degrees suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the study of random graphs (cs.DS). The optimization of algorithms for group testing involves statistical inference and machine learning techniques, which fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
