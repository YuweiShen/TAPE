This involves optimizing a convex problem using implicit differentiation and dual formulation. The paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a meta-learning approach for few-shot learning using linear predictors as base learners to learn representations. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper evaluates the proposed approach on few-shot recognition benchmarks such as miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CIFAR-FS, and FC100. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel approach for few-shot learning that achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper does not explicitly deal with natural language processing, but the proposed approach could potentially be applied to few-shot learning tasks in NLP. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper does not explicitly use neural networks, but the proposed approach could potentially be combined with neural networks for few-shot learning tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
