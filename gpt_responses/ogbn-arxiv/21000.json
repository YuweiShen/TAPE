The focus is on techniques for converting high-dimensional graph data into low-dimensional vector representations while preserving the intrinsic graph properties. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), social and information networks (cs.SI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
