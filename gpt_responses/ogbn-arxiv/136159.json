This involves image processing and feature extraction techniques commonly used in computer vision. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the analysis of finger-vein images, which can be considered as a type of multimedia data. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper addresses the vulnerability of finger-vein recognition systems to presentation attacks and proposes a new approach for detecting such attacks. This is a security-related issue and falls under the scope of cryptography and security. \n4. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper involves the use of biometric systems for human identification, which is a topic related to human-computer interaction. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves the use of feature extraction techniques commonly used in information retrieval to detect presentation attacks on finger-vein biometric systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
