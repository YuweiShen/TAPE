The paper also discusses the use of interactive theorem proving, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the use of big data and machine learning techniques suggests a connection to deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
