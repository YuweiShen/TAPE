This is because the paper introduces a large-scale machine reading comprehension dataset that is derived from real user search queries and web documents retrieved by Bing. The dataset contains questions with human-generated answers and passages that provide the necessary information for curating the answers. The tasks proposed using the dataset involve predicting if a question is answerable, generating a well-formed answer, and ranking retrieved passages given a question. These tasks are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including computational linguistics (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
