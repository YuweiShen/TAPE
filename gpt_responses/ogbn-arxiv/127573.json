It incorporates dispatch decisions on DR resources into the distributionally robust chance-constrained optimal power flow (OPF) framework. This involves the use of empirical data acquired over time and makes no restrictive assumptions on the underlying distribution of the demand uncertainty. The paper also involves numerical experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed learning approach. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
