The paper also discusses the impact of steganography on the quality of voice transmission, which is related to signal processing (cs.SD) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper presents a new hidden data insertion procedure and compares it to a previous approach, which is related to cryptography (cs.CR).
