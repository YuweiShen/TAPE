The method involves computing eigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian, which is a common technique in numerical analysis (cs.NA). The method also involves estimating a random walk on the graph, which is a problem in graph algorithms (cs.DS). The resulting approximate distance is accurate enough to be used in shape correspondence computation, which is a problem in computer vision and machine learning (cs.SI, cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
