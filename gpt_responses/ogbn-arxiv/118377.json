Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) as these fields heavily rely on EM. The paper also discusses Gaussian mixture models, which are commonly used in information theory (cs.IT) and statistics (cs.ST), making these sub-categories also likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
