The use of Marie Curie funding also suggests that this is a research project with a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration. The mention of \"action selection\" and \"state spaces\" suggests that the paper may be related to reinforcement learning or decision-making in complex systems. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper may also be related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) due to the use of reinforcement learning and decision-making algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
