These topics are typically studied in the areas of logic and programming languages, which are covered by cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also discusses the use of computability closure for dealing with higher-order data types, which falls under the category of cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of reduction orderings, which are relevant to the study of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
