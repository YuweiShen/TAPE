The proposed approach involves calculating similarity scores for both text and image modalities, which is a typical task in IR and natural language processing (NLP) (cs.IR) and computer vision (CV) (cs.CV). The use of a quantum-inspired model for decision fusion and ranking is a novel and interdisciplinary approach that involves concepts from quantum mechanics and machine learning (ML), which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG) and data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
