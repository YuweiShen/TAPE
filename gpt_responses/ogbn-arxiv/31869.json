Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper proposes a new solution based on compact convolutional neural networks cascade, which involves the use of machine learning techniques. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe paper also discusses the implementation of the proposed detector using SSE/AVX/AVX2 instruction sets for Intel CPUs, Nvidia CUDA, and OpenCL, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia). \n\nFinally, the paper emphasizes the high computational efficiency of the proposed detector, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
