These are classic topics in computer science, and are typically studied in the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS), computational geometry (cs.CG), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), game theory (cs.GT), and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Given the focus of the paper on optimization problems, it is likely to be classified under one or more of these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
