The paper focuses on the performance-to-price ratio, energy efficiency, and other criteria for selecting the optimal hardware composition. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), cs.MS (Mathematical Software), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
