The paper proposes a new variant of the fully-functional succinct tree representation, which is a data structure that supports a large number of operations in constant time using $2n+o(n)$ bits. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The paper also discusses the worst-case time complexity of the operations, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity) sub-categories. The paper proposes a new algorithmic idea that is simpler to implement, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.AL (Algorithms) sub-category. Finally, the paper presents experimental results to show the superiority of the proposed implementation, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.DM (Data Mining) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
