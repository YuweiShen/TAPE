The use of a composite DNN also suggests that it could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The study of context and its effect on the judgments could also place it under computational linguistics (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the use of crowd-sourcing for the first experiment could suggest that it could also fall under computer-human interaction (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
