The use of Gaussian processes and the relationship between divergence and causal minimum mean-square error (CMMSE) suggest a connection to information theory and probability (cs.ITP). The mention of power spectral densities also suggests a connection to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
