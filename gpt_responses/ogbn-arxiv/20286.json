This involves the use of an overcomplete dictionary of feasible realizations of SIR solutions to partition time series data into individual components representing the effect of a single pathogen. The paper also demonstrates the applicability of the proposed method on five years of seasonal influenza-like illness (ILI) rates estimated from Twitter data. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper involves the use of data-driven approaches and modeling of complex systems. The other likely sub-categories are cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as the paper involves the use of mathematical models and algorithms for analyzing and processing data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
