The use of bounds and algorithms to improve error correction also suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of algebraic geometry, which is a common tool in cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the use of ad hoc parameters and the focus on improving error correction capability suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
