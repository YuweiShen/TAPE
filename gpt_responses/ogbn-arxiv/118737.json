The paper also proposes a new object function to evaluate the contribution of a data source, which involves information retrieval techniques (cs.IR). The scalability of the proposed algorithm and pruning strategies also suggests a focus on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper mentions the importance of considering data quality and overlapping of sources, which are relevant topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
