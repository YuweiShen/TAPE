This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories related to distributed systems, databases, and machine learning. \n\ncs.DB (Databases) is a likely category as the paper discusses the challenges of composing graph-parallel and data-parallel systems using external storage systems. \n\ncs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) is also a likely category as the paper proposes a distributed graph computation framework. \n\ncs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is another possible category as the paper discusses the development of numerous new graph-parallel systems and introduces a new graph computation framework. \n\ncs.LG (Machine Learning) is a possible category as the paper discusses the importance of graph data in language modeling and the development of new graph-parallel systems. \n\ncs.SI (Social and Information Networks) is another possible category as the paper mentions social networks as an example of the growing scale and importance of graph data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
