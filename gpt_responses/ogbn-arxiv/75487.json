Moreover, the paper proposes a probability updating for the Bayesian Game and defines a Nash equilibrium for Causal Games. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with decision-making under uncertainty, which is a core problem in AI. Additionally, the paper proposes a belief updating mechanism for a strategic game, which is a common problem in AI. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper deals with causal inference, which is a topic of interest in machine learning. Moreover, the paper proposes a probability updating mechanism, which is a common problem in machine learning. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with a multi-agent decision problem, which is a common problem in social networks. Additionally, the paper proposes a Nash equilibrium for Causal Games, which is a topic of interest in social networks. \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with belief updating in a strategic game, which is a problem of information transmission.
