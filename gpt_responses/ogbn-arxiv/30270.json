The paper focuses on deep learning models and their performance in comparison to other traditional methods. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) since these sub-categories are closely related to the topic of the paper. Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method on small datasets, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.ST (Statistics) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
