The application domain is neurological disorder identification, which falls under the category of neuroscience (cs.NE). The paper also involves the use of multiple side views to improve the classification performance, which is related to the field of multi-view learning (cs.SI). Finally, the paper involves the use of a branch-and-bound algorithm for efficient subgraph selection, which is related to the field of combinatorial optimization (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
