It may also belong to Multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with a large-scale dataset of landmarks. Information Retrieval (cs.IR) is another possible sub-category as the paper discusses methods for addressing noise and diversity in the dataset. Machine Learning (cs.LG) is also a likely sub-category as the paper uses deep metric learning methods. Finally, Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) is a less likely sub-category as the paper does not explicitly deal with language processing, but it may be relevant if the paper discusses any text-based information associated with the landmarks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
