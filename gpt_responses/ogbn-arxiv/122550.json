The approach presented in the paper involves using hierarchical methods to first identify the background of the text and then test for the presence of text within the identified background. This approach is likely to be of interest to researchers working in computer vision (cs.CV), information retrieval (cs.IR), natural language processing (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
