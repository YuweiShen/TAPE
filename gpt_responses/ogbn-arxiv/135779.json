This involves robotics (cs.RO) as the robot is performing the manipulation behaviors, computer vision (cs.CV) as the input includes RGB images and 3D point clouds, and machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG) as the robot is using support vector machines (SVMs) to predict success. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential for human-robot interaction (cs.HC) as the robot is learning to adapt in the event of failure."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
