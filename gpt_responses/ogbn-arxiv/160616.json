This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the hardness of decoding interleaved Gabidulin codes, which could fall under the Combinatorics and Computational Geometry (cs.CC) or Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a new parameter choice that results in smaller key sizes, which could be relevant to the Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
