The paper also discusses multi-task learning strategies and their effectiveness, which falls under the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of zero-shot learning is another machine learning technique that is discussed, which further supports the likelihood of cs.LG as a relevant sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of neural networks, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also deals with historical text normalization, which involves information retrieval and text processing, making cs.IR a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper does not involve any hardware or system design, making cs.AR and cs.OS less likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
