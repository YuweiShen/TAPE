The use of a common oscillator setup and deterministic channel matrix also suggests a systems and control theory perspective (cs.SY). The specific application of microwave backhaul links falls under the category of mobile and wireless networking (cs.MM) and network infrastructure (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
