This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also proposes a new structure for sphere decoding, which reduces the overall complexity, making it relevant to the signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the number of nodes visited throughout the algorithm tree search, which is a characteristic of algorithms in the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the reduction in complexity achieved by the proposed approach, which is a topic relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
