However, given the focus on semiotics and category theory, the most likely sub-category is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the paper discusses concepts such as literalness, sensitivity, redundancy, ambiguity, generalizability, and chart junk, which are relevant to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Information Theory (cs.IT). The use of category theory also suggests a potential connection to Computational Geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper's focus on understanding and creating knowledge through visualization could also be relevant to Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
