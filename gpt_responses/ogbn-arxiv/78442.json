The paper also discusses the classification and documentation of requirements, which is related to cs.PL (Programming Languages). The empirical investigation of requirements specifications suggests that many non-functional requirements describe system behavior, which is relevant to cs.SD (Software Development) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). Finally, the paper addresses the practical implications of handling non-functional requirements, which could be relevant to cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
