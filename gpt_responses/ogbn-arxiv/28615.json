The use of prospect theory from behavioral economics suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of computational economics (cs.CE). The algorithm design aspect of the paper may also place it under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.MA) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the optimization problem and analysis of the objective function may also suggest the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
