The approach involves estimating the sequence in which biomarkers become abnormal based on cross-sectional data and creating a disease progression timeline. This involves fitting a generalized Mallows model to subject-specific orderings and staging subjects on the estimated timeline. The paper uses machine learning techniques such as relative distance between events and patient staging algorithms. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
