This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a model-agnostic learning paradigm with gradient-based meta-train and meta-test procedures, which is a common approach in the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also introduces two complementary losses which explicitly regularize the semantic structure of the feature space, indicating a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. Finally, the paper demonstrates its effectiveness on object recognition benchmarks, which is a common task in multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
