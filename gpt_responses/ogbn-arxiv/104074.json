It specifically addresses the problem of using delay-tolerant jobs to fill the extra capacity of datacenters, referred to as trough/valley filling. The paper proposes two joint dynamic speed scaling and traffic shifting schemes that assume little statistical information of the system, which is usually difficult to obtain in practice. The paper also considers practical issues that may arise in datacenter networks, including capacity and bandwidth constraint, service agility constraint, and load shifting cost. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.PF (Performance), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
