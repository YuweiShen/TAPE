This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HCI) sub-category. The system also involves automatic server-side computation and surfacing of salient features, indicating a potential fit with the Databases (cs.DB) and Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. The use of machine learning techniques for generating recommendations suggests a possible fit with the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper focuses on visual exploration and analysis of data, indicating a potential fit with the Visualization (cs.VIS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
