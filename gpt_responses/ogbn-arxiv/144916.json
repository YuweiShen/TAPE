The paper specifically focuses on exploration in reinforcement learning, which is a problem that falls under the category of exploration-exploitation trade-off. The paper proposes a new approach to tackle this problem by learning contingency-awareness and controllable aspects of the environment. This approach involves developing an attentive dynamics model (ADM) that discovers controllable elements of the observations. The ADM is trained in a self-supervised fashion to predict the actions taken by the agent. The paper then demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach on a set of Atari games. \n\nBased on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves aspects of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), and natural language processing (cs.CL) since the proposed approach involves learning from visual observations and predicting actions. However, these sub-categories are less likely than cs.LG since the paper primarily focuses on reinforcement learning and its application to Atari games."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
