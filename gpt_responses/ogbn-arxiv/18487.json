The paper proposes two strategies to reduce the time complexity of the ensemble shapelet transform algorithm. These strategies involve selecting shapelet candidates of a given small length and training a single linear classifier in the feature space. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers research on various machine learning techniques, including supervised learning, which is the focus of this paper. \n- cs.DM (Data Mining): This sub-category covers research on the process of discovering patterns in large datasets, which is relevant to the time series classification problem addressed in this paper. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers research on various aspects of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, which is the focus of this paper. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category covers research on various computer vision and pattern recognition techniques, which may be relevant to the time series classification problem addressed in this paper. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category covers research on various neural network and evolutionary computing techniques, which may be relevant to the machine learning techniques used in this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
