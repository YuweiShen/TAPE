It also focuses on the problem of reward tampering, which is a common issue in reinforcement learning algorithms (cs.LG). The paper proposes modifications to the reinforcement learning objective to prevent reward tampering, which involves optimizing the agent's behavior (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper discusses the corrigibility and self-preservation properties of the proposed solutions, which are relevant to computer security (cs.CR) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
