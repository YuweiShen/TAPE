The paper also focuses on learning effective features and incorporating relation information, which are key topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper specifically applies these techniques to mammogram images (cs.MM) and evaluates the proposed method on a large-scale dataset, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
