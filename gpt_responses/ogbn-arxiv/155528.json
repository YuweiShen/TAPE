Additionally, the comparison of formal models may involve the use of data structures (cs.DS) and programming languages (cs.PL). The inclusion of game-theoretic models suggests a connection to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), while the consideration of service-oriented computing may relate to Software Engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
