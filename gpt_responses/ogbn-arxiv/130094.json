The paper also mentions the integration of sensors, computation, and communication, which could fall under machine learning (cs.MA) and multimedia (cs.MM). The use of materials in creating robots that can sense and respond to their environment could also fall under the category of embedded systems (cs.EM). Finally, the paper discusses the challenges that the robotics community needs to address, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
