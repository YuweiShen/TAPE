The paper proposes a new approach for batch learning from logged bandit feedback, which is relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of maximum likelihood estimation and inverse propensity weights, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also presents empirical results on multi-label classification problems, which is a topic in data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the application of the proposed technique to ad placement, which is a topic in computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
