The use of Krylov subspace methods and data sparsity suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) sub-categories. The application of the proposed methods to an industry-scale data set for binary classification of compound activity on target proteins suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. Finally, the use of large data sets and scalability suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
