The use of Block RIP is a relatively new concept in this area, which could also make it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper's focus on sparsity and compressed sensing could also make it relevant to the signal and image processing subcategory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
