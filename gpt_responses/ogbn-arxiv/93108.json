The paper proposes methods to formulate an effective query from complex textual structures and latent vector space models that circumvent the vocabulary gap in IR. This topic is closely related to several sub-categories of computer science, including Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Deep Learning (cs.DL). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper, ordered from most to least likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
