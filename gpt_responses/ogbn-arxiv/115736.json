The use of polynomials over finite fields suggests a connection to algebraic coding theory (cs.DS). The mention of list-decoding and locally correctable codes suggests a connection to complexity theory (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the use of standard tools to obtain capacity achieving locally list decodable codes suggests a connection to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
