The use of hypergraphs and graph-based codes suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and data structures (cs.DS). The mention of private information retrieval (PIR) also suggests a connection to cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the use of batch codes and redundancy suggests a connection to complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
