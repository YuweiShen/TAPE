The use of Hamilton-Jacobi equations is a common approach in optimal control and trajectory planning, which suggests that the paper could belong to cs.RO (Robotics) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also introduces a new multi-vehicle coordination paradigm, which suggests that it could belong to cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). The paper mentions that the method can be applied to heterogeneous systems, which suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
