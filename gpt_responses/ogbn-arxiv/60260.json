The paper also presents a hardware extension for the RISC-V core, which falls under the category of Computer Architecture (cs.AR). The use of Sponge-based authenticated encryption and control-flow integrity suggests that the paper may also belong to the categories of Embedded Systems (cs.ET) and Software Engineering (cs.SE).
