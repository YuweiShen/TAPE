This is a key area of research in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the implementation of cross-packet HARQ, which is a technique used in wireless networks to improve reliability and throughput. \n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking) - The paper focuses on improving the performance of HARQ transmission over block fading channels, which is a key area of research in communication and networking. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a new degree of freedom in HARQ transmission, which allows for better matching between the codebook and the channel states experienced by the receiver. This is a control problem that can be addressed using systems and control techniques. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - While the paper does not explicitly discuss security or cryptography, the proposed coding strategy could have implications for security in wireless networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
