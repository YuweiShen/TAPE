Both of these problems are commonly studied in computer science and fall under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper involves probabilistic analysis and optimization, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also uses techniques from computational complexity (cs.CC) and game theory (cs.GT) to analyze the approximability of the problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
