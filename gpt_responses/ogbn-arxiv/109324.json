The paper proposes a modified differential SfM algorithm that can estimate relative pose from two consecutive frames despite RS artifacts. \n2. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper proposes a RS-aware warping for image rectification method that can remove RS artifacts from images. This is a common problem in graphics and image processing. \n3. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper proposes a 9-point algorithm to recover the relative pose of a rolling shutter camera that undergoes constant acceleration motion. This is relevant to robotics, where cameras are often used for navigation and mapping. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the problem of RS artifacts in video processing, which is a common problem in multimedia applications. The proposed RS-aware warping for image rectification method can be useful in multimedia applications such as video editing and post-production. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a modified differential SfM algorithm that can estimate relative pose from two consecutive frames despite RS artifacts. This is relevant to AI, where computer vision algorithms are often used for object detection, tracking, and recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
