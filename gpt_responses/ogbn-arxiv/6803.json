It could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves training agents to play Atari games. The use of recurrent networks suggests it could also be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The use of Atari games suggests it could also be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the use of optimization techniques suggests it could also be categorized under cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
