The most relevant sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which specifically deals with NLP and its applications. The paper also discusses automatic evaluation methods, which involve machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.AI a likely sub-category as well. The use of linguistic features and language models also suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) as a possible sub-category. The paper also mentions correlation scores and quality estimation tasks, which are related to information retrieval (IR) and cybernetics (CY), respectively, making them potential sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
