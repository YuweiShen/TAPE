The paper also discusses the girth of the resulting codes, which is a property related to the cycle structure of the code graph, making categories such as cs.SI (social and information networks) and cs.DS (data structures and algorithms) relevant. Finally, the paper analyzes the lifting factor required for constructing the codes, which involves combinatorial optimization techniques, making cs.CC (computational complexity) a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
