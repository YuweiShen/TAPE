The paper proposes an efficient SDP algorithm for inference on fully-connected CRFs, which is a problem that arises in many computer vision tasks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper proposes a tailored quasi-Newton method, which is a numerical optimization technique, and takes advantage of low-rank matrix approximation, which suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The paper also discusses the limitations of conventional CRFs and the need for more complex priors, which suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper proposes an efficient algorithm for solving a specialized SDP dual problem, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
