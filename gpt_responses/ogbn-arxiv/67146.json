The method also involves motion estimation, which is a common task in multimedia processing (cs.MM). The paper uses a fully convolutional neural network, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also addresses challenges like occlusion and blur, which are common in computer graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
