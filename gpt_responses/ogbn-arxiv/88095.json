This falls under the scope of signal processing (cs.SI) and statistical learning (cs.SD). The proposed algorithm is based on spectral methods, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper also discusses the theoretical guarantees of the algorithm, which falls under the scope of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
