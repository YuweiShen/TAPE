This is a machine learning approach and falls under the category of cs.LG.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed method involves the use of a surrogate model and a nested sampling algorithm to perform efficient and robust exploration of the parameter space. This is an AI-based approach and falls under the category of cs.AI.\n3. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses deep recurrent networks to construct the surrogate model, which is a type of neural network. This falls under the category of cs.NE.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the estimation of unknown values of parameters that characterise a physical system. This falls under the category of cs.SY.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a method to address the computational expense and inefficiency in exploring the parameter space, which is relevant to computational engineering and science. This falls under the category of cs.CE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
