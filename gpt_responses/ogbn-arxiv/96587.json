The use of covariance matrices and pilot sequences also suggests a possible connection to statistical inference (cs.ST) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the focus on spatial correlation in the channel could also make the paper relevant to signal processing (cs.SP)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
