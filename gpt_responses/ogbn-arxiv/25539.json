The algorithm is applicable to any heuristic solver that can be run multiple times to give a sample. The paper presents results for several classes of hard problems solved using simulated annealing, path-integral quantum Monte Carlo, parallel tempering with isoenergetic cluster moves, and a quantum annealer. Therefore, the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Computational Complexity (cs.CC), Robotics (cs.RO), and Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
