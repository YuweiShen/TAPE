This involves the use of consensus-based methods to enforce rules and prevent arbitrary actions by the administrator. This topic falls under the scope of cryptography and security in the context of blockchain-based systems.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a distributed consensus-based approach for managing cryptocurrencies, which involves modifying the implicit Bitcoin specification. This topic falls under the scope of distributed computing, which is a key aspect of blockchain-based systems.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the use of consensus methods to enforce rules and provide transparency in managing cryptocurrencies. This involves the design and implementation of data structures and algorithms for distributed consensus, which falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a hybrid approach for managing cryptocurrencies that involves ongoing management functions by the currency administrator and consensus-based enforcement of rules. This involves the design and implementation of software systems for managing cryptocurrencies, which falls under the scope of software engineering.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the implications of the proposed hybrid approach for managing cryptocurrencies on trust, transparency, and accountability.
