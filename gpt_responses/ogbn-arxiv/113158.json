The use of adaptive virtual patients and a physics-informed learning framework also suggests a focus on machine learning and data generation. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper specifically addresses medical data, which suggests it could also belong to cs.MED (Medical Imaging) and cs.NEURON (Neurons and Cognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
