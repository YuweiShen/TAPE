Specifically, it uses a fully convolutional recurrent network (FCRN) to learn to associate pen-tip trajectories with sequences of characters. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. Additionally, the FCRN is end-to-end trainable, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on two databases, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
