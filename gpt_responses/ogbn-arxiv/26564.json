The paper also presents a new algorithm for open world recognition, which falls under the broader umbrella of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the issue of outlier detection, which is a common problem in computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the experiments are conducted on a large-scale image dataset, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
