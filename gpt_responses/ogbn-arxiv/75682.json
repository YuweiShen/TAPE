The paper's proposed coding scheme could potentially improve the performance of such systems. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - While not directly related to machine learning, the paper's use of linear coding schemes may be of interest to researchers in the field of machine learning, as linear models are commonly used in that area."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
