This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the category of \"Computer Security and Cryptography\" (cs.CR) as it deals with the security risks associated with spreadsheets. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of spreadsheets as operational applications, which suggests that it may also belong to the category of \"Databases\" (cs.DB) as spreadsheets are often used to store and manage data. The paper also discusses the cost of manually maintaining the integrity of spreadsheets, which suggests that it may belong to the category of \"Software Engineering\" (cs.SE) as it deals with the development and maintenance of software systems. Furthermore, the paper mentions the use of commercially available off-the-shelf solutions, which suggests that it may also belong to the category of \"Programming Languages\" (cs.PL) as it deals with the use of tools and frameworks for software development. Finally, the paper discusses the use of monitoring solutions to establish a database of information for business intelligence, which suggests that it may also belong to the category of \"Cybernetics\" (cs.CY) as it deals with the use of information systems for decision-making and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
