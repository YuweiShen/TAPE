The applications of squares of codes in cryptography also suggest a possible fit in the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The focus on cyclic codes, which are a specific type of linear codes, suggests a possible fit in the category of coding theory (cs.CC). The study of minimum distance of codes and constructions of codes with specific parameters also suggests a possible fit in the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DS). Finally, the study of parameters of codes and their squares can also be seen as a problem in computational complexity and optimization, which suggests a possible fit in the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
