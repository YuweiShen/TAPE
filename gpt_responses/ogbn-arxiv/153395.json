The focus is on improving the recognition precision, which falls under the category of information retrieval (IR). The paper also discusses text string recognition, which is a common task in natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics (CL). The proposed method involves weighting criteria, which is a common technique in machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM). Finally, the paper provides experimental data for verifying the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method, which is a common practice in multimedia (MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
