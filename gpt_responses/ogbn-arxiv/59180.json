Specifically, the paper proposes an efficient method for obtaining the rank configuration of the whole network in SVD-based network compression. This involves balancing the trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity/memory consumption. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper deals with neural networks, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, since the paper proposes novel accuracy metrics and uses them to optimize the network compression, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
