The use of $L_p$-norm minimization is a common approach in compressed sensing, which falls under numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also utilizes the replica method, which is a statistical physics technique commonly used in compressed sensing (cs.SI). Finally, the problem of compressed sensing has applications in image and signal processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
