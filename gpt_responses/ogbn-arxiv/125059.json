The use of advanced deep convolutional neural network approaches also suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The evaluation of the results using different performance metrics indicates the involvement of information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the use of benchmark datasets and the focus on medical imaging suggests the involvement of multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
