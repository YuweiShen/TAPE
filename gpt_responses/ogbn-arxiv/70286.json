The paper focuses on the development of an efficient obstacle detection and tracking algorithm based on depth image pairs, which is a core component of robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed approach also involves a chance-constrained model predictive controller (CC-MPC) to ensure robust collision avoidance, which is a combination of control theory (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach in a variety of environments, which involves experimental validation and performance evaluation, indicating a potential fit for machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
