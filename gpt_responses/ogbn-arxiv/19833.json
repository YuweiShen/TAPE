This optimization problem is related to information theory and signal processing. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a distributed IRS-empowered communication network architecture, where multiple source-destination pairs communicate through multiple distributed IRSs. This architecture is related to networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a coordinated passive beamforming approach for distributed IRSs, which involves controlling the phase shift matrix of the reflecting elements. This approach is related to systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of intelligent reflecting surfaces to enhance the performance of wireless networks, which can be applied to multimedia applications such as video streaming and online gaming. \n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): This category is less likely, but the paper does involve some mathematical optimization and algorithmic development, which can be related to computation and language."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
