This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including computer security (cs.CR), software engineering (cs.SE), operating systems (cs.OS), distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC), and systems and control (cs.SY). Given the focus on security and containment of exploits, cs.CR is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.SE and cs.OS. The use of kernel features and containerization also suggests relevance to cs.DC and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
