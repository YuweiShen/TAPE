The use of Rademacher observations is a novel approach to this problem, which is likely to be of interest to the machine learning community (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of anonymization and the lack of shared IDs, which are common issues in data management and privacy (cs.DB). The use of a classifier and the need to learn from partially shared features suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence community (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the complexity of the algorithms used, which is a common topic in cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the use of subsets and the minimization of loss suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the data structures and algorithms community (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
