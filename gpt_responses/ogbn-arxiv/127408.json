The paper proposes a scheme to detect misbehavior in LTE-U duty cycling, which involves security and cryptography (CR) and information theory (IT). The proposed scheme is evaluated through simulations, which involves multimedia (MM) and systems and control (SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
