This involves the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms to estimate the position of the UE directly inside the radio access network (RAN), thereby assisting in radio resource management. This work is related to network infrastructure (NI) and machine learning (LG) as well as artificial intelligence (AI) and information theory (IT) since it involves the use of DL models to estimate the position of the UE. Additionally, the paper uses raytracing tools and system level simulators to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism, which is related to multimedia (MM) since it involves the use of simulation tools to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
