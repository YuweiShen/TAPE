This falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV) and medical imaging (cs.Medical Imaging). The paper also proposes a new approach that incorporates global context modelling and multi-scale feature aggregation, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning and deep learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper uses a subject-level 10-fold nested cross-validation, which is a common technique in neural network training and evaluation (cs.NEURON)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
