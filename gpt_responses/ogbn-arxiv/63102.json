The proposed Saliency-guided Attention Network (SAN) uses visual attention modules to learn fine-grained correlations between vision and language, which is a common technique in computer vision. \n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper also deals with natural language processing, as it proposes a textual attention module to learn discriminative textual representations that are highly sensitive to visual clues. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel neural network architecture for image-sentence matching, which involves learning appropriate representations across multi-modal data. This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new approach to solve a challenging task, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence research. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with matching images and sentences, which is a task related to multimedia analysis. The proposed SAN involves both visual and textual attention modules, which is a common technique in multimedia analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
