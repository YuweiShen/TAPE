The use of polynomial functions and symbolic words suggests a focus on machine learning and data mining (cs.LG, cs.DM). The paper also mentions the construction of histograms, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and similarity search (cs.SI). Finally, the application of the method to various domains implies a broad scope that could fit under artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
