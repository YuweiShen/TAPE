This is a core topic in computer vision research.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Object detection is a fundamental task in AI, and the paper proposes a new approach to improve the performance of single-shot detectors.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The FSAF module involves online feature selection and multi-level anchor-free branches, which are machine learning techniques.\n4. cs.RO (Robotics): Object detection is an important task in robotics, and the FSAF module could potentially be applied in robotics applications.\n5. cs.CVPR (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): CVPR is a major conference in computer vision, and the paper presents a new approach to object detection that could be of interest to the CVPR community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
