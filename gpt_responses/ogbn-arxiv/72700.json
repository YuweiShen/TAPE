The paper presents applications of the proposed method to images and triangular meshes, demonstrating their versatility and effectiveness, comparing favorably to existing methods, despite being relatively simple models. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper involves the use of Gaussian processes, which are commonly used in the sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and the paper presents a new method for learning relationships on non-Euclidean domains, which could be relevant to the sub-category cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
