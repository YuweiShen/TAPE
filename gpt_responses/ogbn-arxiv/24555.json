The proposed method involves using a bi-directional cascade network and a scale enhancement module, which are both techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which is a popular neural network architecture in computer vision and machine learning. Additionally, the paper discusses the reduction of network parameters, which is a topic in neural architecture search (cs.NE) and model compression (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
