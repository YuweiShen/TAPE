This problem is commonly studied in the fields of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper proposes a Bayesian optimization framework that unifies previous works and can incorporate both model-based and data-driven algorithms, which falls under the categories of systems and control (cs.SY), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
