The use of lifting and affine-invariant codes also suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also mentions local correction and testing, which are topics in distributed computing (cs.DC) and property testing (cs.CC). Finally, the connection between lifted codes and lower bounds on Nikodym sets suggests a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
