This involves adapting a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for regression to predict 3D marker references from 3D fully-deployed markers. The paper also validates the proposed method on three commonly used stent grafts and five patient-specific 3D printed aortic aneurysm phantoms. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV) as the paper deals with 3D shape reconstruction from 2D images. The next likely sub-category is robotics (cs.RO) as the paper focuses on robot-assisted FEVAR. Multimedia (cs.MM) is also a possible sub-category as the paper deals with medical imaging. Artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) are also possible sub-categories as the paper involves adapting a GCN for regression."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
