This involves combining multiple data modalities like RGB and infrared features to obtain a more discriminative representation. The paper proposes a novel Partial-modal Generative Adversarial Networks (PM-GANs) that learns a full-modal representation using data from only partial modalities. This involves generating a representation in place of the missing data channel. The paper also introduces a new Infrared-Visible Dataset for action recognition. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). Multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) are also likely categories as they deal with combining multiple data modalities. Infrared (cs.IR) is also a possible category as the paper deals with infrared data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
