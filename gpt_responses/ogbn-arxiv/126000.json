The paper discusses various aspects of 5G, such as extreme densification of networks, integration of wireless and optical sides of telecom networks, and the study of wireless networks using complex systems science. \n\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the candidate technologies that might help achieve the intended goals of 5G, which could involve information theory techniques such as channel coding, modulation, and signal processing. \n\n3. cs.COMM (Computer Communications and Networks) - The paper discusses various aspects of wireless communication systems, such as spectrum access, network densification, and antenna arrays, which are all relevant to computer communications and networks. \n\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the extreme densification of networks and the integration of wireless and optical sides of telecom networks, which could involve systems and control techniques such as optimization, feedback control, and network management. \n\n5. cs.PHYS (Physics and Society) - The paper briefly mentions the interaction between antennas and a novel waveform, which could involve physics-based modeling and analysis. However, this is a relatively minor aspect of the paper compared to the other subfields mentioned above."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
