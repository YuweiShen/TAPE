The paper also extends a defense framework for neural networks against adversarial attacks, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of iterative hard thresholding and basis pursuit algorithms, which are commonly used in compressed sensing (cs.CR). Finally, the paper provides theoretical guarantees for the recovery of signals, which involves numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
