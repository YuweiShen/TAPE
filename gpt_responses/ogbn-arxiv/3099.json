These topics are closely related to information theory, which deals with the efficient transmission and processing of information. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): NR is a radio access technology that enables wireless communication between User Equipment (UE) and base stations. This paper discusses the technical details of NR's wideband operation, which is an important aspect of wireless networking. \n\n3. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper briefly mentions the support of UEs with limited radio frequency (RF) capability, which could be related to hardware architecture. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper mentions the use of NR in the mmWave band, which is a frequency range that is often used for high-bandwidth multimedia applications. \n\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the introduction of the new bandwidth part concept, which allows for flexible and dynamic configuration of UE's operating bandwidth. This could be related to systems and control, which deals with the design and analysis of complex systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
