The approach leverages spatio-temporal coherence and temporal dependencies in the motion of the surgical tools. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques for training the neural network. Finally, the paper deals with multimedia (cs.MM) data in the form of laparoscopic videos."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
