The paper also proposes a new method for improving the receptive field size of point convolutions, which is a fundamental aspect of convolutional neural networks and is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. Additionally, the paper includes experiments on popular point cloud benchmarks, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) and natural language processing (cs.CL) communities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
