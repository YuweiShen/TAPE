The paper also proposes methods to exploit the structure of the channel matrix, which can be seen as a system-level approach and thus falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed methods, which involves statistical analysis and modeling, making it relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.MM) and Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
