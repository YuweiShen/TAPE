This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. Additionally, the paper applies the Design Science Research (DSR) method to the development of abstractions for scientific applications, which suggests that it may also belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of abstractions for big data and streaming applications, which suggests that it may belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DL) sub-category. Furthermore, the paper addresses the critical problem of distributed resource management on heterogeneous infrastructure, which suggests that it may also belong to the Databases (cs.DB) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
