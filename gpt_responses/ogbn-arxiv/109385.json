The approach presented in the paper employs a combination of networks trained for specialized tasks such as scene recognition, person activity classification, and attribute prediction, which are all related to computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper uses normalized canonical correlation analysis (nCCA) to map features to a joint embedding space, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the importance of carefully choosing the spatial support for feature extraction, which is relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL). The optimization problem solved to learn to combine scores from nCCA models is a machine learning problem (cs.LG). Finally, the paper is related to information retrieval, as it involves answering questions from a dataset (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
