The use of aggregation constraints and the study of consistency of answers to aggregate conjunctive queries suggest a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The investigation of complexity and approximation algorithms is a common theme in theoretical computer science (cs.CC) and algorithm design (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
