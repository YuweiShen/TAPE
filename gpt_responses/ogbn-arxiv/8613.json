The study of quotient complexity also involves the use of data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also uses mathematical logic (cs.LO) to derive upper bounds on the complexity of regular language operations. Finally, the study of regular languages and their complexity is closely related to computational complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
