This problem is closely related to the fields of information theory (cs.IT), communication systems (cs.COMM), and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the tradeoff between the achievable information rate and the estimation distortion, which is a topic in multimedia systems (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT, cs.COMM, and cs.SY, followed by cs.MM and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
