The use of algorithms for mapping, localisation, and SLAM also suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed metrics for evaluating robustness may also involve machine learning techniques, which could relate to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the application of localisation in autonomous vehicles involves control systems and decision-making, which could fall under the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
