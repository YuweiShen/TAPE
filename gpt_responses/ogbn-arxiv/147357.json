This involves optimization of information transmission and power transfer, which falls under the purview of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with a multiuser MISO system, which involves communication between multiple nodes. The use of power splitters and beamforming also involves network architecture and design.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper involves the design of a system that simultaneously transfers wireless information and power, which requires control over the transmission and power transfer mechanisms. The optimization of transmit power and receive PS ratio also involves control theory.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper involves the transmission of wireless information, which can include multimedia data such as audio and video. The optimization of beamforming and power transfer can also impact the quality of multimedia transmission.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper involves the use of semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to obtain a solution to the problem with imperfect channel state information (CSI). This involves computational techniques and optimization methods, which fall under the purview of computational engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
