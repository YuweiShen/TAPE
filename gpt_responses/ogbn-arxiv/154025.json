The proposed method, T-RECS, involves preprocessing the input data to account for speed variability, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves training the models using T-RECS, which could also fall under neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
