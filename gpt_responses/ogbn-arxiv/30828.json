The paper also proposes a hierarchical combinatorial modeling approach, which can be categorized under computational engineering (cs.CE) and simulation and modeling (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper mentions the usage of numerical examples to illustrate the suggested approach, which can be related to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
