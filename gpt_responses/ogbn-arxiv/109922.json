The paper also discusses how the proposed representation relates to the basic concepts of quantum mechanics, which could fall under systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves complex-valued functions and joint probability distributions, which could also be relevant to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
