This topic is closely related to several sub-fields of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), communication systems (cs.COMM), optics and photonics (cs.OH), physical sciences (cs.PHY), and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Given the focus on channel modeling and performance analysis, cs.IT and cs.COMM are the most likely sub-categories. However, the use of atmospheric turbulence channels and the need for physical layer considerations suggest that cs.OH and cs.PHY are also relevant. Finally, the use of FSO communication systems implies a need for networking and internet architecture considerations, which could be relevant to cs.NI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
