The focus is on prior-free auctions, which are relevant in many real-world scenarios, such as online advertising. The paper proposes a new class of mechanisms called quasi-proportional mechanisms, which allocate the item in a way that depends quasi-proportionally on the bids. The paper analyzes the properties of these mechanisms, including the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibria, the computational complexity of finding them, and the revenue guarantees. The paper also compares the quasi-proportional mechanisms to the well-known proportional mechanism, which is a special case of the former. Overall, the paper combines elements of game theory, optimization, and algorithms, and could be classified under several arXiv CS sub-categories, such as cs.GT (Game Theory), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.EC (Economics and Computation)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
