This is a well-studied problem in the field of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the control and balance of co-channel interference among users, which is a common problem in signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia systems (cs.MM). Finally, the paper provides numerical examples to validate the proposed solution, which is a common practice in communication systems (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
