The paper also discusses the use of adaptive filters, which is a common technique in graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. The proposed method also involves efficient estimation of atmospheric light, which can be considered as an artificial intelligence (cs.AI) problem. Finally, the paper discusses the enhancement of textures and edges, which is a common problem in machine learning (cs.LG) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
