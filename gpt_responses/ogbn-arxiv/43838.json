It also discusses the human factors involved in the interaction, such as mental workload and situation awareness, which are important topics in human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The incorporation of planning capability into the robot involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the investigation of trade-offs between different types of remote human-robot teaming involves optimization and decision-making (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
