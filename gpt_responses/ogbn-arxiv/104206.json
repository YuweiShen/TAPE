The paper focuses on the construction of the optimization function for structure fusion and the retention of the special characteristic of each view data by spectral embedding. This work involves machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), social and information networks (cs.SI), and computation and language (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
