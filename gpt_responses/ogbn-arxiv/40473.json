The method proposed in the paper is specifically designed to handle textures, which is a subfield of computer graphics (cs.GR). The paper also mentions the use of patch-based distance, which is a common technique in multimedia processing (cs.MM). The method also involves automatic adjustment of spatial constraints, which can be seen as a form of machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
