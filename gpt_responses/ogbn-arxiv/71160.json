The paper also discusses the use of Optimal Transport, which is a well-known technique in machine learning. Additionally, the paper presents experimental results on robotic tasks, which is a common application area for machine learning.\n\nThe paper also touches upon the use of reward functions, which is a common topic in the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of Kantorovich potentials as a reward function is also related to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision), which often deals with image-based tasks and the use of distance metrics.\n\nThe paper's focus on robotic experiments and the use of optimal transport suggests that it may also belong to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.RO (Robotics). Finally, the paper's discussion of sample efficiency and large-scale applications suggests that it may also be relevant to the arXiv CS sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
