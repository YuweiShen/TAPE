Additionally, the use of attention mechanisms and neural networks further supports this categorization. It could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it involves the development of a neural summarization model. The use of graph representations suggests that it could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
