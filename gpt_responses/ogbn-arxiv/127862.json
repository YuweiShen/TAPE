This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to the Game Theory sub-category.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper deals with pursuit-evasion games on graphs, which involves the use of algorithms and data structures to model and analyze the game. This sub-category is therefore a likely fit.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Pursuit-evasion games are a classic problem in AI, and the paper's focus on strategies and equilibria suggests that it could be relevant to the AI sub-category.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with a multiplayer game on graphs, which could be seen as a social network. The study of equilibria and strategies could also be relevant to the information networks sub-category.\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): Pursuit-evasion games on graphs often involve geometric concepts and algorithms, and this sub-category could be a possible fit for the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
