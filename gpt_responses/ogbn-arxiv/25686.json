The proposed method uses a deep two-stream ConvNet for key frame detection, which involves learning to predict the location of key frames. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of a summarizer and discriminator, which are aimed at capturing the appearance and motion features of video frames and distinguishing between key frames and others in the video. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
