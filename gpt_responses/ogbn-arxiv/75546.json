The proposed method involves a memory module to alleviate the forgetting issue during training, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the issue of category and pattern imbalance, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves semantic and instance segmentation, which is a subfield of natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper proposes a memory-augmented network, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
