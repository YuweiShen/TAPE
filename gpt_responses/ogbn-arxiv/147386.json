This suggests that the paper may belong to the Signal Processing (cs.SD) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the calculation of non-causal features, which is a common topic in Information Theory (cs.IT) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also presents design rules for time-frequency representation fission and fusion, which could fall under the sub-categories of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) or Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
