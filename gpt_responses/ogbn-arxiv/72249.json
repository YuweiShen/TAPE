The approach also involves structural optimization of neural networks (cs.AI), which is another sub-category of machine learning. The experimental results also show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in image classification tasks (cs.CV). Finally, the approach is also useful for ensemble classification and progressive inference, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
