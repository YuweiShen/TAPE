Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the optimization of achievable average per-link rate, which falls under the category of cs.IT (Information Theory). The concept of network multiple access is also used, which is related to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The paper also mentions the effectiveness of the hierarchical cooperation scheme for networks operating at mm-waves, which falls under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the use of TDMA and spatial reuse, which is related to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
