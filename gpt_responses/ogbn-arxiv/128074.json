Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also makes use of dense vectors and customization techniques, which are common in machine learning and artificial intelligence research, making cs.AI a likely sub-category as well. The paper also improves the state of the art on a dataset, indicating a focus on machine learning and optimization, making cs.LG and cs.NE likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves information retrieval and text mining techniques, making cs.IR a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
