This involves a waveform design approach based on bi-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing to cope with the highly asynchronous access of different devices and to allow transmission of control signaling and payload \"\"in one shot\"\". Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n1. cs.IT (Information Theory) - as the paper discusses a new waveform design approach based on bi-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing to enable efficient transmission of control signaling and payload. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - as the paper focuses on a new random access procedure to support sporadic traffic as an enabler of the Internet of Things (IoT). \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - as the paper addresses the challenge of coping with the highly asynchronous access of different devices in a wireless communication system. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - as the paper discusses the transmission of payload in a wireless communication system. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - as the paper uses a novel mathematical approach and numerical experiments to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed waveform approach over the conventional random access."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
