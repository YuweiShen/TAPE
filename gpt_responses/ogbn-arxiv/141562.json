The paper also discusses the characterization of multipath fields as a sum of orthogonal waveforms or spatial modes, which is a topic related to signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of acceptable signal to noise ratio (SNR) on degrees of freedom, which is a topic related to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
