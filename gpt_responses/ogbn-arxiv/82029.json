The proposed method involves probabilistic distribution and thresholding, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (CL). The experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, which are commonly used in multimedia (MM) research. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
