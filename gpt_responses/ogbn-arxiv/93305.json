The approach involves a two-path 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that takes two volumes with an object to be tracked as its input and predicts the necessary motor input parameters to compensate the object's movement. This work involves computer vision (CV) techniques for tracking objects in OCT volumes, robotics (RO) for controlling the motion of the imaging system, multimedia (MM) for processing and analyzing the OCT volumes, artificial intelligence (AI) for the deep learning-based approach, and machine learning (LG) for the training and optimization of the CNN model. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV, cs.RO, cs.MM, cs.AI, and cs.LG, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
