The paper also introduces a new model for multi-prover interactive proofs that better reflects the strategic nature of service providers from a game-theoretic viewpoint, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of game theory (cs.GT). Additionally, the paper discusses the design and analysis of non-cooperative rational interactive proofs, which involves concepts from cryptography (cs.CR) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the technical results of the paper focus on protocols that give strong guarantees on utility gap, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.AL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
