The paper discusses the computational complexity of the problem in various graph classes, which is a topic of interest in computational complexity (cs.CC) and graph theory (cs.GT). Additionally, the paper presents new classes of graphs where the problem can be solved in polynomial time, which is relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
