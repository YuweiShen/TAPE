The paper also discusses content-based remote sensing image retrieval (CBRSIR), which is a subfield of information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of unsupervised encoder-decoder features and deep discriminator networks for image matching and similarity identification respectively, involves machine learning techniques such as deep learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
