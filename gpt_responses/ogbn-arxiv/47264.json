The proposed method uses a convolutional neural network for diagnostic features localization from CLE images. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of Weakly-Supervised Learning (WSL)-based model for feature localization that trains on image-level annotations, which falls under the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe paper also proposes a novel multiscale activation map that is laterally inhibited and collaterally integrated, which is a technique used in deep learning and falls under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of state-of-the-art methods for comparison, which falls under the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). \n\nFinally, the paper deals with medical imaging, specifically confocal laser endomicroscopy glioma images, which falls under the sub-category of cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
