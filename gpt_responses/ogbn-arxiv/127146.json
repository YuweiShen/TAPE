The use of empirical methods to study the manipulability of single transferable voting suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The sampling of different distributions of votes and the analysis of their manipulability involves the use of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the study of voting rules and their manipulation can be seen as a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
