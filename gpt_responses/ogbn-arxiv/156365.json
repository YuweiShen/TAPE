The use of secret keys for encryption and distortion as a measure of secrecy also suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the optimal tradeoff between different parameters, which is a problem that is often studied in machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
