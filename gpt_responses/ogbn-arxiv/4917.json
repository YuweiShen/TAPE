The paper proposes a phase-based tuning approach that specializes system tunable parameters to the varying runtime requirements of different execution phases. The paper focuses on cache tuning as an example application and proposes a phase distance mapping approach to determine the best configuration for a phase without incurring significant tuning overhead. Based on this description, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.EM (Embedded Systems), followed by cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
