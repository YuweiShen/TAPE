It specifically focuses on circular-shift linear network coding, which is a type of linear network coding, and proposes a new method for constructing circular-shift linear solutions. This makes it likely to also fall under the sub-categories of network protocols and algorithms (cs.NI), social and information networks (cs.SI), distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DS), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
