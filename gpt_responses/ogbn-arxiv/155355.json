The use of external knowledge-bases and reranking techniques suggests that this paper may belong to the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The contrastive estimation method used in the paper is a machine learning technique, which suggests that this paper may also belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the use of global features and the incorporation of external knowledge-bases suggest that this paper may belong to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the experiments conducted in the paper suggest that it may also belong to the sub-category of sound (cs.SD), as they are conducted in the music domain."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
