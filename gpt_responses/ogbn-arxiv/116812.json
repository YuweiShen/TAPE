Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of recurrent neural networks, which falls under the category of neural networks and deep learning, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a likely sub-category as well.
