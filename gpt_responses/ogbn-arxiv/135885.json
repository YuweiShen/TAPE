This technology is especially effective in addressing communication and energy efficiency problems for low-power communications systems such as sensor networks, which falls under the category of networked and distributed systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the architecture and solutions to address existing issues and limitations of ambient backscatter communications systems, which involves information theory and signal processing (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper highlights emerging applications of ambient backscatter communications, which could include machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.MA) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper outlines some open issues and future research directions, which could involve cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
