This suggests a distributed and parallel computing aspect to the work.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper focuses on seismic imaging, which is a computational science application. The use of a domain-specific language compiler for solving the underlying wave equations also suggests a computational engineering aspect to the work.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the use of a domain-specific language compiler for solving the underlying wave equations, which suggests a software engineering aspect to the work.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the use of a domain-specific language compiler for solving the underlying wave equations, which suggests a programming languages aspect to the work.\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper discusses the use of a domain-specific language compiler for solving the underlying wave equations, which suggests a numerical analysis aspect to the work."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
