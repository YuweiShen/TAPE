The paper proposes a new method that introduces a sparse regularizer into the reduced dual problem, which is a topic that falls under the category of optimization and regularization techniques in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the concentration of the resulting dual solution on its support set, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper presents numerical experiments and a novel application of the proposed method to distributed learning, which are topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper deals with high-dimensional data, which is a topic in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
