The use of object localization meta-architectures for end-to-end ROI skin lesion detection involves machine learning techniques, which could also fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed natural data augmentation method involves manipulating the data to improve the performance of the algorithms, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the evaluation of the performance of the algorithms involves comparing them with state-of-the-art methods, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
