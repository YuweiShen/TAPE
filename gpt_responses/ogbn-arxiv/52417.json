Additionally, the paper proposes improved word coding schemes to reduce memory and computation burden, which could fall under the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The use of MoS and the proposed improvements also involve neural networks, which could place the paper in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also reports results on image captioning, which could suggest a potential overlap with the cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
