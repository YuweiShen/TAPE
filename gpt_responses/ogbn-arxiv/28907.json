The paper also discusses joint estimation and detection, which is a common technique in information theory (cs.IT). The proposed approach involves the use of matched-filtering, which is a signal processing technique that is often used in communication systems (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the performance analysis and simulation results, which are common in systems and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach to improve the performance of backscatter communication, which is a topic that falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
