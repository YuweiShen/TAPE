The paper also discusses incorporating information from maps, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The optimization of the graph involves using robust kernels, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses navigation and exploration, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
