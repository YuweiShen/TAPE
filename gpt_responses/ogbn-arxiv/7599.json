However, given the focus on user interaction and the use of visual sketches as input, the most likely category is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HCI). The paper also deals with data wrangling and program synthesis, which are relevant to databases (cs.DB) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of visual elements and composition of different visual elements suggests a connection to computer graphics (cs.CG), while the use of domain-specific languages (DSLs) and program analysis suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
