The use of Pareto fronts and trade-off analysis is also a common technique in multi-objective optimization (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the complexity of the problem and provides an MILP encoding, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the use of strategies and product constructions is related to game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
