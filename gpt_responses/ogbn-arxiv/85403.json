This topic falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses how these 2D-2D matches can be generated with little human interaction by geometrically matching points from 3D models built from images, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions creating datasets for cross-season correspondence and day-to-night correspondence, which could fall under graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
