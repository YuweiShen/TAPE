The use of deep learning models also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. Additionally, the use of attribute-semantic and identity-discriminative feature representation spaces suggests that it could belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category. The unsupervised learning aspect of the method suggests that it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. Finally, the use of benchmarks and evaluations suggests that it could belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
