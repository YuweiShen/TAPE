The paper also discusses the efficiency of algorithms in terms of communication exchanges, which is a key aspect of Distributed Systems (cs.DS). The paper presents new algorithms for read operations that improve on prior works, which is a contribution to the field of Systems and Control (cs.SY). The paper also rigorously argues the correctness of the algorithms, which is a common theme in the field of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper deals with the implementation of algorithms, which is a topic in Programming Languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
