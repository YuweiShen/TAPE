This involves designing a dedicated camera parameter space with embedded constraints, path planning techniques, and coordinating the motion of multiple drones around dynamic targets. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.GR (Graphics). The paper also involves some machine learning techniques, which could place it in cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
