Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper discusses the technical details of the Python implementation and system support required to deploy the system, which falls under the categories of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also evaluates the performance and scalability trade-offs, which falls under the category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper discusses the use of TEEs, which is related to cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
