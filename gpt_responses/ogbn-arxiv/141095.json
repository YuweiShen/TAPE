Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CC (Computational Complexity), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also involves the use of a specialized function finder program, which suggests a possible connection to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
