The proposed model is based on identifying characteristic keywords for topics, which influence topic-assignments of nearby words. This approach is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including computational linguistics (cs.CL), information retrieval (cs.IR), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
