This falls under the broad category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of multiple views (different brain regions) and the optimization of weights also suggest relevance to neural networks (cs.NE) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the application of the technique to group-wise analysis of brain activity suggests relevance to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
