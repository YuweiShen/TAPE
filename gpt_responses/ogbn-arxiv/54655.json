The paper proposes a new feedback strategy that exploits the structure of the Grassmannian manifold, which is a topic in algebraic geometry (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of channel length, mobility, and the number of feedback bits, which are topics in signal processing (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
