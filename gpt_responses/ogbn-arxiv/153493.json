The paper also mentions the General Video Game Artificial Intelligence (GVG-AI) framework, which is a platform for testing AI agents in video games and falls under the cs.GT category. The paper discusses the effects of MCTS modifications on bug finding, which is a software engineering (SE) task and falls under the cs.SE category. The paper also evaluates the human-likeness of the human-like agent, which involves human-computer interaction (HCI) and falls under the cs.HC category. Finally, the paper discusses the computational budget of the MCTS algorithm, which involves control systems (SY) and falls under the cs.SY category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
