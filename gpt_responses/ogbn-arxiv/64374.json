The paper also discusses the compression of the model, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The authors mention the use of the model on edge devices, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the use of triplet training, which is a common technique in information retrieval (cs.IR) and the creation of a visual similarity solution, which falls under natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
