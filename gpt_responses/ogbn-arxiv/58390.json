The proposed algorithm involves geometric computations and data structures, which are also relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the evaluation of the method involves machine learning techniques such as classification and clustering, which could be considered as part of the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
