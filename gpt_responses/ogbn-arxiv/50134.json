As such, it could fit into several arXiv CS sub-categories. \n\ncs.LG (Machine Learning): This paper proposes a new method for improving deep reinforcement learning agents, which is a subfield of machine learning. \n\ncs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Deep reinforcement learning is a subfield of AI, and this paper proposes a new method for improving agents in this area. \n\ncs.RO (Robotics): Reinforcement learning is an important area of research in robotics, and this paper proposes a new method for improving agents in this area. \n\ncs.CV (Computer Vision): The authors test their method on Atari games, which often involve visual input, and could therefore be relevant to computer vision. \n\ncs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The proposed method involves adjusting the value predicted by a neural network, and could therefore be relevant to the subfield of neural computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
