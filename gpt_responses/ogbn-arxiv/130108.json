The use of Network Utility Maximization (NUM) also suggests that the paper may belong to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The coordination scheme and active learning approach may also involve the use of control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. Finally, the optimal learning formulation mentioned in the abstract suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
