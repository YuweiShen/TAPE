The paper also extensively uses deep learning techniques, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of covariance pooling, which is a statistical technique and could be categorized under mathematical modeling (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the use of facial landmarks and regional features, which could be categorized under human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper discusses the use of temporal evolution of per-frame features for video-based facial expression recognition, which could be categorized under neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
