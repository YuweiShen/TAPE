Therefore, cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of tableau rules, which are a common tool in automated reasoning and theorem proving, making cs.CC (Computational Complexity) a likely sub-category as well. The paper also discusses complexity results, which are often related to algorithms and data structures, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the extension and generalization of existing logics, which falls under cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
