The paper proposes a novel meta-learning based framework for correcting weak labels, which is relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Among these, machine learning (cs.LG) is the most likely sub-category as the paper deals with learning with weak supervision, which is a core problem in machine learning. The other sub-categories are also relevant as the paper discusses experiments on multiple datasets involving computer vision and natural language processing tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
