This falls under the category of artificial intelligence. \n2. cs.LG - The paper uses deep neural networks to learn the transition model and Monte Carlo tree search to plan the best sequence of actions. This falls under the category of machine learning. \n3. cs.CV - The paper uses visual input in the form of the agent's first-person-view image to solve the block-placing task. This falls under the category of computer vision. \n4. cs.GR - The paper proposes a method to solve a task in Minecraft, which involves interacting with a 3D environment.
