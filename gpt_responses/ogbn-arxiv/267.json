The dataset is also likely to be useful for computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) applications related to object tracking and motion prediction. The paper also discusses assumptions and simplifications made by models, indicating a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
