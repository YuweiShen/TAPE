The use of atomic norm convex relaxation and compressed sensing techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the implementation of encoding in analog hardware, which may suggest a connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
