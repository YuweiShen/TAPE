Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques to extract relevant information from the articles, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another likely category. The use of deep learning models for the task makes cs.LG (Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) possible categories. Finally, the paper also involves active learning, which is a subfield of machine learning, making cs.DL (Deep Learning) another possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
