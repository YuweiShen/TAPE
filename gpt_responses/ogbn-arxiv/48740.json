The system also facilitates interactive exploration of the query answers, which involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and human-computer interaction (cs.HCI) to help the user choose combinations of parameters for clustering, inspect the clusters, and visualize how changes in parameters affect clustering. Finally, the paper also mentions using natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques to extract information from the query answers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
