Therefore, the most likely category is cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also discusses symbol tables and conditional parsing, which are related to natural language processing and machine learning, so cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely categories. The paper also addresses practical applications of the extended PEG language, which could fall under cs.SE (Software Engineering) or cs.SC (Symbolic Computation)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
