The use of adversarial training and semantic features also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Information retrieval (cs.IR) is another possible sub-category as the paper deals with retrieving images based on sketches. Multimedia (cs.MM) and natural language processing (cs.CL) could also be relevant sub-categories due to the use of semantic features and category-level word vectors."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
