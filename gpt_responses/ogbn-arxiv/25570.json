This method involves applying nonlinear transformations on the optical flow components to generate input images for the temporal stream. This work is primarily focused on computer vision (CV) and machine learning (LG) techniques for activity recognition. Additionally, the use of optical flow and neural networks suggests that this paper could also be relevant to multimedia (MM) and artificial intelligence (AI) subcategories. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed method on two well-known datasets suggests that this paper could also be relevant to information retrieval (IR) subcategory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
