The paper also proposes a new loss term to encode prior knowledge into the network, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of the method is on medical images, specifically skin lesion segmentation, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
