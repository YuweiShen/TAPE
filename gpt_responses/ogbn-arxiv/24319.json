The focus on optimizing specific quantiles of the cumulative reward makes it relevant to the sub-category of stochastic control (cs.SY). The use of algorithms for solving the QMDP problem makes it relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents analytical results which makes it relevant to the sub-category of mathematical analysis (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
