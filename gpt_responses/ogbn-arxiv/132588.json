This problem is relevant to video analytics and has applications in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also introduces a novel algorithm based on the Recursive Projected Compressive Sensing (ReProCS) framework, which involves compressive sensing (cs.IT) techniques. The paper also discusses performance guarantees and correctness results, which are relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
