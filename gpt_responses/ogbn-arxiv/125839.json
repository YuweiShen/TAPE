This problem is relevant to several areas of computer science, including multi-agent systems (cs.MA), robotics (cs.RO), distributed computing (cs.DC), systems and control (cs.SY), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper presents a formal model of a distributed traffic control protocol and provides assertional proofs of its correctness, which are typical of work in the areas of multi-agent systems and distributed computing. The paper also presents simulation results that provide estimates of throughput, which is relevant to the area of systems and control. Overall, the paper is likely to be of interest to researchers in several areas of computer science, with the most likely categories being cs.MA and cs.RO."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
