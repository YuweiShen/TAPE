The use of fractional cascading is also a common technique in computational geometry and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses dominated maxima searching, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper's approach to nearest neighbor queries using any Minkowski metric involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI). Finally, the paper's focus on efficiency and optimization suggests a possible connection to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
