This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Additionally, the paper presents empirical results on several natural sequential tasks including speech spectrum prediction, question answering, and language modeling, which suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computation and Language (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
