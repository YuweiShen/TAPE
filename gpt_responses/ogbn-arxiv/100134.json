The paper also involves mathematical analysis of finite groups and their generating sets, which could fall under information theory (cs.IT) or computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper may also be relevant to the study of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) due to the discussion of sampling generating sets. Finally, the paper's potential impact on fully homomorphic encryption schemes could relate to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
