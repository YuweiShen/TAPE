The experiments involve image classification tasks (cs.CV) and natural language processing tasks (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the coherence between adaptation trajectories in parameter space, which is a concept related to neural network optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
