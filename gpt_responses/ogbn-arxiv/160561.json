The paper also discusses the optimal strategy for the entrepreneur to maximize revenue, which is a typical problem in game theory. \n- cs.CY (Computational Finance): Crowdfunding is a form of financing, and the paper proposes a computational approach to improve revenue in crowdfunding. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Crowdfunding platforms are social networks where entrepreneurs and backers interact. The paper discusses how to influence backers' beliefs through information design, which is related to the study of social and information networks. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not directly address cryptography and security, but crowdfunding platforms may face security and privacy issues, such as fraud and data breaches. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a heuristic algorithm to compute information-disclosure policies for the entrepreneur, which is related to the study of data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
