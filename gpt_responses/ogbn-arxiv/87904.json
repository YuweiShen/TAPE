Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also introduces a new algorithm for lexically constrained decoding, which involves modifying the beam search algorithm used in NMT. This algorithm involves dynamic beam allocation, which is a technique used in optimization problems and falls under the category of artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, cs.AI is also a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the relationship between the model and BLEU scores, which are commonly used in evaluating NMT models. This involves statistical learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) since NMT can be used for tasks such as image captioning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
