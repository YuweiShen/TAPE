The proposed method involves the selective use of high resolution processing based on the confidence of predictions on downscaled WSIs, which is a machine learning approach (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of modern computing resources, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
