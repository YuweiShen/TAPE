The algorithms are based on linear programming relaxations, which is a common technique in theoretical computer science (cs.DS, cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of configuration LPs and bidirected LP-relaxations, which are specific types of LPs that have been used in network-design and vehicle-routing problems (cs.GT). Finally, the paper involves optimization of a prize-collecting objective, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
