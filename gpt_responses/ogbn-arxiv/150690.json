This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of a database (DrugBank) and focuses on personalized medicine, which could suggest the computer engineering (cs.CE) and database (cs.DB) sub-categories.
