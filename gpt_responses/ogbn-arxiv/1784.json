This involves the use of computer vision techniques and deep neural networks, which are commonly associated with the computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of a customized architecture for the deep neural network, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper aims to improve communication for the deaf community, which falls under the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with recognizing emotions, which is a topic commonly associated with multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
