This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV). The use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for visual navigation also falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of a low-power computing platform and real-time constraints, which could fall under the categories of embedded systems (cs.EM) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
