This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of ReliefF algorithm for feature selection suggests that the paper may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. The use of textural features and SVM classifier suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of iterative VMD for signal processing suggests that the paper may also belong to the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
