Additionally, the paper uses link prediction to forecast the evolution of cross-domain patent networks, which could also fit under cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also analyzes dynamic technology networks, which could fall under cs.DL (Digital Libraries) and cs.SD (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
