It may also belong to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category as it involves processing signals in a MIMO system. Additionally, it could be categorized under Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) as MIMO systems are commonly used in wireless communication networks. The paper also involves the use of data structures and optimization techniques, which could place it under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
