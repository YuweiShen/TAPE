Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel procedure for multiple kernel learning, which is a machine learning technique, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also deals with feature selection, which is a common problem in information retrieval, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with small training sets, which is a common problem in data mining, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
