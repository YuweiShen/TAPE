The minimal distance and constant weight are also important parameters in coding theory, which is closely related to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The construction of the code involves combinatorial techniques, which is a common theme in computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also mentions the number of codewords, which is a topic in discrete structures (cs.DS). Finally, the construction of the code involves optimization, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
