This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), multimedia (cs.MM), systems and control (cs.SY), and machine learning (cs.MA). However, given the focus on modeling and evaluating mm-Wave systems, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
