The use of unitary weight matrices and the concept of full-diversity are also mentioned, which are common in signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents coding gain expressions, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
