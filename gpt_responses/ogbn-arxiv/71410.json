This suggests that the paper belongs to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the representation of terms and the removal of data structures encoding the evaluation context, which are topics that fall under the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) and Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-categories, respectively. The paper also touches on the scalability of the proposed approach to open terms, which is a topic that falls under the Data Structures (cs.DS) and Theory of Computation (cs.THEORY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
