The paper also addresses the issue of discrimination, which is related to computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) and cybernetics (cs.CY). Additionally, the use of an auxiliary variable for prediction is a statistical inference technique, which is relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
