The method involves clustering input states semantically and selecting core experiences to be stored in a container, which relates to robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions defining linguistic functions, which suggests the use of natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
