The proposed method uses video sequences and edge-based visual odometry techniques, which are common in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.AI) research. The paper also discusses the use of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data, which is relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents experimental results, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) research on object detection and recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
