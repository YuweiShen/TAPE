Therefore, cs.COMM and cs.IT are the most likely categories. The paper also discusses subband filtering and optimization, which falls under the categories of cs.SY and cs.NI. Finally, the paper proposes a new method for waveform generation, which could be considered a machine learning approach, placing it under the category of cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
