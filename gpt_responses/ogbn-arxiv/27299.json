The use of computer assistance suggests that the paper may involve algorithmic aspects, which is also a common theme in cs.DS. The determination of non-embeddable trees involves combinatorial arguments, which is related to cs.DM. The study of ordered trees and their embeddings may involve graph theory (cs.GT) and the use of prescribed cyclic orders suggests a possible connection to computational topology (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
