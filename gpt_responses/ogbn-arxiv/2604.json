Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper also mentions self-supervised pseudo-labeling, which is a common technique in natural language processing tasks, indicating a possible connection to cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the experiments involve image datasets, suggesting a potential connection to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
