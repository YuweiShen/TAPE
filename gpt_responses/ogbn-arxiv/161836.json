This falls under the scope of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.GT). The paper also uses techniques from data structures (cs.DS) and computational geometry (cs.CG) to develop reduction rules. Additionally, the paper discusses the complexity of Feedback Arc Set in Tournaments and Cluster Editing, which are both topics in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
