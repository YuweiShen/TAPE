This problem is a fundamental algorithmic primitive with recent applications in combinatorial optimization, robust learning, and quantum complexity. The paper uses matrix analytic techniques to overcome obstacles that have stymied prior approaches to this open problem. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves the use of matrix inequalities and analysis of Schur complements of matrices, which are techniques commonly used in the sub-categories cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
