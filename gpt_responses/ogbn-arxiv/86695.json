The use of deeper networks and interpretation of classification decisions also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of datasets and analysis of results suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and potentially also on computer security (cs.CR) in the context of video surveillance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
