This involves the use of deep learning-based approaches for visual saliency and scene parsing, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The application of this technique to robotics for mapping and localization falls under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The joint optimization of semantic labels and obtaining odometry also involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper presents extensive quantitative evaluation and comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches, which is relevant to the computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CVPR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
