The paper also discusses fine-tuning and ensemble methods, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper deals with image quality distortions, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a gating network, which is a type of neural network architecture, and discusses weight sharing methods, which are common in neural network optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
