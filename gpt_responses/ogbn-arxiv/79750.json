The paper also proposes a method of incorporating high-level semantic concepts and external knowledge, which are related to natural language processing and artificial intelligence, respectively. Therefore, it is likely to be categorized under cs.CL and cs.AI. The paper also uses neural networks, which are a common tool in machine learning, and achieves state-of-the-art results, which are typically reported in cs.LG.
