The most relevant sub-category for this topic is likely cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper focuses on improving the generalization capabilities of DQN through regularization methods. Additionally, the paper uses Atari 2600 games as a benchmark, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-categories. The use of deep RL algorithms also suggests that it could belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. Finally, the focus on control policies suggests that it could also belong to cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
