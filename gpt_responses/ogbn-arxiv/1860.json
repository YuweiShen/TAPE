It focuses on the use of genetic-evolutional learning strategy to build a group of unit models, which can be either traditional machine learning models or recent deep learning models with a much smaller and shallower architecture. The learning results of each instance at the final generation will be effectively combined from each unit model via diffusive propagation and ensemble learning strategies. This paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
