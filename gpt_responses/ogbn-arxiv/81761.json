Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a differentiable sequence-level training objective, which involves optimizing a probabilistic n-gram matching metric, and uses greedy search during training to alleviate exposure bias. These aspects suggest that the paper could also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on the NIST Chinese-to-English translation task, which involves processing visual data, so it could also be relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
