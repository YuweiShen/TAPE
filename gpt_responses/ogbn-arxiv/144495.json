This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): Although the paper does not explicitly mention distributed computing, the proposed emergency control scheme could potentially involve distributed control and coordination among different parts of the power grid. \n- cs.PF (Power and Energy): The paper deals with emergency control of power grids, which is a topic within the domain of power and energy. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The proposed emergency control scheme could be seen as an emerging technology in the field of power systems, as it aims to provide seamless electricity service to customers during emergency situations. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper involves formulating and solving optimization problems related to emergency control of power grids, which falls under the domain of computational engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
