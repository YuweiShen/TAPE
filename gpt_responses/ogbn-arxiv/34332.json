The proposed solution involves cooperative perception, which is a technique that involves multiple sensors and data fusion, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the impact of sensor configuration on detection performance, which is relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
