This involves network infrastructure and communication protocols, which are typically covered in the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also discusses the selection and placement of tier-1 mobile devices, which can be considered a form of resource allocation and optimization, falling under the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The paper also mentions Quality of Experience (QoE) assessment, which is a topic covered in the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category.
