It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as hand pose estimation is an important task in robotics. Additionally, the use of a neural network for regression makes it likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the use of 3D voxel input and modeling of finger bones may also make it relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
