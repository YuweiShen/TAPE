The paper also discusses the application of the clustering algorithm to graph partitioning, which falls under the category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). The paper also presents algorithms for solving linear systems and approximating eigenvalues, which fall under the categories of Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Numerical Analysis (cs.NA).
