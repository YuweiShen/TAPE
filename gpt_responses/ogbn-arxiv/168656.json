The paper also emphasizes the need for integrating diverse formal techniques, which suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper mentions the complexity of robotic systems, which could lead to a focus on programming languages and compilers (cs.PL) and logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
