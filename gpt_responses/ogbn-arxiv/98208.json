Specifically, it proposes a structured compressed sensing algorithm for cyclostationary detection from sub-Nyquist samples, which extends orthogonal matching pursuit to account for the structure imposed by cyclostationarity. This makes it highly likely that the paper belongs to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SP), and Machine Learning (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with spectrum sensing and estimation, which are common topics in the Statistical Learning (cs.LG) and Signal and Image Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
