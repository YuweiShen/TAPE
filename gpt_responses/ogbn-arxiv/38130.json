The paper also discusses hardware implementation, which falls under computer architecture and embedded systems (cs.AR). The use of matrix multiplication in partial sums computation suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS). The proposed architecture for computing partial sums and generating the generator matrix involves circuit design and optimization, which is related to electronic and embedded systems (cs.ET). Finally, the use of polar codes in communication systems suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
