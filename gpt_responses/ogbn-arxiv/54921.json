The paper introduces a new exploration algorithm that is feasible in high-dimensional Markov decision processes (MDPs) and achieves near state-of-the-art results on several notoriously difficult Atari 2600 video games. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which is focused on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of function approximation techniques to enable RL agents to generalize in order to estimate the value of unvisited states. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category, which is focused on the development of intelligent agents that can reason, learn, and act autonomously. \n\nAdditionally, the paper discusses the use of feature representations of the state space for value function approximation, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category, which is focused on the development of algorithms and models for image and video analysis. \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the use of exploration strategies in robotics applications, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category, which is focused on the development of algorithms and models for robot perception, control, and planning. \n\nOverall, the most"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
