The paper specifically deals with visual classification tasks, which could also place it under \"cs.CV\" (Computer Vision). The use of graph structures and connections between examples suggests that it could also be relevant to \"cs.SI\" (Social and Information Networks) and \"cs.CL\" (Computation and Language) sub-categories. Finally, the mention of dynamic regularization techniques and the use of neural networks suggest that it could also be relevant to \"cs.AI\" (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
