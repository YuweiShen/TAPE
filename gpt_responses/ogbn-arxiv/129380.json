The use of Radon and Gabor transforms for feature extraction is a common technique in image processing and analysis, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the use of deep learning (cs.DL) for image annotation, which is a popular approach in computer vision. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed method involves statistical analysis (cs.LG) to measure the retrieval accuracy."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
