This topic is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE), as well as information theory (cs.IT) which deals with the quantification and transmission of information. The paper specifically focuses on the performance of different DL models and brain parcellation methods, which suggests a strong emphasis on image analysis and medical imaging applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
