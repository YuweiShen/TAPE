The use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of image processing domain knowledge, which could suggest that it belongs to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category.
