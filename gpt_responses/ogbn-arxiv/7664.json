The proposed method involves the use of separable filters, which is a technique for reducing computational complexity, and this is a topic that falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the proposed method on CPU or GPU, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
