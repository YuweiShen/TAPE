The use of erasure option and the study of error exponents suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of information theory and probability (cs.ITP). The paper also discusses the application of the proposed decoder in decision feedback and ARQ, which are topics in cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of competitive minimax methodology suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the study of the binary symmetric channel suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
