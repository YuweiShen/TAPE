This falls under the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is typically categorized under cs.CL (Computation and Language). The package provides access to various evaluation resources, including automatic metrics, word-level accuracy scores, and reference-independent quality estimation features, which are commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) research (cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.NE). Additionally, the package generates reports on the performance of SS systems, which could be relevant to information retrieval (IR) research (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
