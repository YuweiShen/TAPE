This technology is a mix of electrical and magnetic components, making it relevant to the cs.EM (Electromagnetics) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of probabilistic graphical models, which is relevant to the cs.AR (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of machine learning and reasoning under uncertainty, which is relevant to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of in-memory computations, which is relevant to the cs.MS (Mathematical Software) sub-category.
