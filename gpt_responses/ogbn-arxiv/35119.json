The paper focuses on leveraging hardware-impacted hysteresis effect and sparsity to achieve the symbiosis of model compactness and accuracy with execution efficiency. This work involves machine learning (cs.LG), natural language processing (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
