The attack is based on solving non-linear equations, which involves mathematical techniques such as the extended Euclidean algorithm and record multiplicity attacks, indicating a strong connection to information theory (cs.IT) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The scheme also involves biometric templates, which suggests a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
