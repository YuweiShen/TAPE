The paper also presents algorithms for basic counting tasks such as distinct counts and heavy hitters, which are problems in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper uses statistical techniques and noisy decoding, which are topics in information theory (cs.IT). The paper also presents lower bounds for pan-privacy, which is a topic in theoretical computer science (cs.TH) and privacy-preserving algorithms (cs.CR). Finally, the paper presents streaming algorithms, which are a topic in machine learning and data mining (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
