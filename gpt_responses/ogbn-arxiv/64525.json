However, the focus on distributed linear precoding and user selection suggests that the paper is most likely to be classified under the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category, which deals with the study of communication systems and their limits. Other likely sub-categories include Networked Systems (cs.NI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Multiagent Systems (cs.MA), which are all relevant to the problem of coordinating multiple entities in a distributed system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
