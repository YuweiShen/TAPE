Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) are likely categories. The paper also involves techniques from information theory (cs.IT), as well as algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) for locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) of kernel distance. Finally, the paper mentions applications to control systems (cs.SY) in the context of kernel two-sample testing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
