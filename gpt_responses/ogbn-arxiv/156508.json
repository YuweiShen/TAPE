The method used in the paper involves using WordNet, which is a lexical database for English, and adapting it to other languages, which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the method involves comparing it to other lexicons, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the limitations of intrinsic evaluation of polarity lexicons, which falls under cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
