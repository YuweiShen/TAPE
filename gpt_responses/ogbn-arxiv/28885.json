The paper also mentions the use of logic programming (cs.PL) and the evaluation of benchmarks (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of efficient evaluation techniques (cs.SE) for computing split semi-equilibrium models. Finally, the paper deals with the semantics of ASP, which is related to mathematical logic (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
