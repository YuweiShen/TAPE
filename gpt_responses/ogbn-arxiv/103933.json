This topic is closely related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and logic (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper discusses the logical properties of stereotypical reasoning, which is relevant to computational linguistics (cs.CL) and cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a formal model, which could be of interest to researchers in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
