This falls under the purview of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the performance of a cell-free massive MIMO system, which is a wireless communication technology. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes different estimators for channel estimation and investigates their impact on the system performance. This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n4. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper deals with the performance analysis of a wireless communication system, which falls under the domain of communications and networking.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): Although the paper does not deal with multimedia directly, it uses mathematical tools and techniques that are commonly used in multimedia applications, such as signal processing and estimation theory. Hence, cs.MM is a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
