The authors propose a solution that uses convolutional neural networks trained to capture the appearance of the target identity from an unstructured collection of his/her photographs. This approach is enabled by framing the face swapping problem in terms of style transfer, where the goal is to render an image in the style of another one. The paper builds on recent advances in this area and devises a new loss function that enables the network to produce highly photorealistic results. The authors aim at making face swap work in real-time with no input from the user by combining neural networks with simple pre- and post-processing steps. Given the focus on computer vision and deep learning techniques, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.GR (Graphics), cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
