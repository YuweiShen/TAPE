The paper specifically focuses on surrogate explainers of black-box machine learning predictions, which is a topic that falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and cybersecurity (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper proposes a framework for building custom local surrogate explainers, which involves algorithmic techniques and could be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Therefore, the most likely categories for this paper are cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.CL, and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
