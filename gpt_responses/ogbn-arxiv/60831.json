This falls under the broad category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of multiple sources of feedback to tailor the policy, which could fall under Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) or Information Retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper also discusses the balance between power consumption and accuracy, which could fall under Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
