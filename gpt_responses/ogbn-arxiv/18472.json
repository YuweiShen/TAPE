This falls under the category of machine learning. \n3. cs.PL - The paper is focused on planning heuristics, which is a subfield of automated planning. \n4. cs.RO - Planning heuristics are important for robotics applications, as they can help robots plan their actions efficiently. \n5. cs.SY - The paper's focus on planning heuristics and learning from state/value pairs is relevant to systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
