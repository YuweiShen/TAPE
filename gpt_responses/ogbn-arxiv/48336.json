The paper also provides sample complexity guarantees, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The use of partitioning techniques and the optimization of tree size are topics that fall under data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper discusses the practical benefits of learning to branch, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
