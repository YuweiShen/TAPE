This is a central topic in computational complexity theory.\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper does not explicitly deal with game theory, but it introduces a new framework for studying groups that includes many mathematically important groups, which could have implications for game theory.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper does not explicitly deal with logic, but it establishes the semi-decidability of the word problem for the studied groups, which is a central concept in logic.\n- cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with groups that are presented as quotient groups of a free group and a normal subgroup, which is a topic in discrete mathematics.\n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper deals with the Blum-Shub-Smale model of real number computation, which is a topic in symbolic computation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
