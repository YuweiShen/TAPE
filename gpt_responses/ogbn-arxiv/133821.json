Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves algebraic structures and properties of codes, which could fall under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper uses mathematical techniques such as linear algebra and group theory, which could be relevant to cs.DS (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
