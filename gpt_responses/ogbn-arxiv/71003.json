The use of deep learning methods also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.MM) and machine learning applications (cs.LG) sub-categories. Information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) could also be possible sub-categories as they deal with image processing and optimization, which are relevant to the denoising algorithms used in this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
