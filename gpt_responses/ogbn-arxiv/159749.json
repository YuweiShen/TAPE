This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the robustness properties of the controller, which could be related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper includes experiments on a nano-quadrotor, which could involve computer vision (cs.CV) for tracking and sensing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
