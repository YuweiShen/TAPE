This suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Software Development (cs.SD), and Machine Learning (cs.LG). However, since the paper focuses more on the construction of the knowledge graph and its applications, cs.AI and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
