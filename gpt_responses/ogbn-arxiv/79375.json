The paper proposes a new method for adaptive online batch sampling, which involves a training protocol and hardness-aware positive mining pipeline. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on several standard benchmarks, indicating that it may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
