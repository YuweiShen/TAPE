The focus on multi-level subsetwise sparsifiers suggests that the paper may be more relevant to cs.DS and cs.CG, which often deal with geometric and combinatorial optimization problems. However, the use of ILPs and the experimental evaluation may also indicate a connection to cs.DM and cs.NA. The mention of distortion functions and pairwise spanners suggests a possible connection to cs.GT, which often deals with network design and routing problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
