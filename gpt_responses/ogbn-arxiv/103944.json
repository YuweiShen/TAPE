The use of Steiner points and the planarity of the graph suggest that it belongs to the computational geometry (cs.CG) sub-category. The analysis of the number of edges and the absence of Steiner points suggest that it could also belong to the graph theory (cs.GR) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM) sub-categories. The use of logarithmic bounds suggests that it could belong to the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the problem of constructing increasing-chord graphs could also be relevant to the social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
