The paper proposes a modification to the RESCAL model, which is a popular method for knowledge graph embedding, making it more generalizable by incorporating information about the types of entities that appear as arguments to relations. This modification involves adding a regularization factor to the loss function, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also evaluates the performance of the modified model in terms of mean reciprocal rank and hits@N, which are common evaluation metrics in information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper deals with knowledge bases, which are often stored in databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
