The approach involves learning a Perturbation Rectifying Network (PRN) using synthetic and real perturbations, which is a machine learning task (cs.LG). The paper also proposes an efficient method to compute synthetic perturbations, which involves optimization techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The defense mechanism involves detecting perturbations, which is a security and cryptography problem (cs.CR). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed framework involves testing on real-world scenarios, which is a multimedia computing problem (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
