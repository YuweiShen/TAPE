The paper also introduces new notions of bit-compressibility and informant-compressibility, which are related to compression and coding, and hence could be relevant to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses worst-case analysis, which is a common theme in the Cryptography (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
