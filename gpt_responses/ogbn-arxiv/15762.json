Therefore, cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are likely sub-categories. The paper also uses techniques from computational geometry and graph theory, which suggests cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) as possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper mentions that the problem is NP-hard, which is a complexity theory result, making cs.CC (Computational Complexity) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
