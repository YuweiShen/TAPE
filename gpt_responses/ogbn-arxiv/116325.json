It also involves machine learning techniques for performance evaluation, which makes it likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.MM) and Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of crowdsourcing for data collection and annotation makes it relevant to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category.
