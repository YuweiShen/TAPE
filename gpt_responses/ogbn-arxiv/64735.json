The paper proposes a novel scheme for batch incremental hard sample mining of minority attribute classes from imbalanced large scale training data, which is a problem that is often encountered in computer vision. The paper also introduces a Class Rectification Loss (CRL) regularising algorithm to avoid the dominant effect of majority classes. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval), as these sub-categories are also relevant to the topic of attribute recognition in images."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
