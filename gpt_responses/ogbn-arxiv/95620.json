The paper also discusses the nature of the face code that emerges at the top level of such networks, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments conducted in the paper involve measuring the extent to which individual DCNN features operate in a view-dependent or view-invariant manner, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper visualizes the DCNN feature space for over 24,000 images of 500 identities, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
