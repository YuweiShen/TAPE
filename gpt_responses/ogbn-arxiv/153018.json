This topic is closely related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it involves designing systems that can effectively utilize human input. The paper also discusses the management of workers who lack expertise or attention, which falls under the category of cybersecurity (cs.CY) and social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses game theory to analyze the proposed mechanism, which is a subfield of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
