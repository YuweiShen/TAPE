This involves optimizing energy consumption and generation while fulfilling energy demand. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a data-driven solution using a multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning framework, which involves training agents to learn energy dispatch policies. This falls under the scope of neural and evolutionary computing.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a learning-based approach to optimize energy dispatch in self-powered wireless networks. This falls under the scope of machine learning.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with optimizing energy consumption and generation in self-powered wireless networks with edge computing capabilities. This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper involves optimizing energy dispatch decisions while fulfilling energy demand, which involves information theory concepts such as data transmission and processing.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a semi-distributed data-driven solution using a multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning framework, which involves distributed computing concepts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
