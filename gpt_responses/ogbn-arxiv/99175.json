The use of geometric cues and data-driven approaches suggest that the paper may also fall under the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. The evaluation of cues for shape recognition suggests that the paper may also fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The user studies and quantitative tasks suggest that the paper may also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the mention of relaxing assumptions in shape from shading suggests that the paper may also fall under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
