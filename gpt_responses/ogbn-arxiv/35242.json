It also mentions the use of these codes in cryptography (cs.CR). The paper involves the study of cyclic codes and their properties, which falls under the category of discrete structures (cs.DS). The new method presented in the paper may also be of interest to researchers in the field of machine learning and data mining (cs.DM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of different triples to construct error-correcting codes, which may be of interest to researchers in the field of signal processing and information retrieval (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
