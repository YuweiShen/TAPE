The proposed method, called Adaptive GAMP, enables joint learning of the statistics of the prior and measurement channel along with estimation of the unknown vector. The methodology can be applied to a large class of learning problems including the learning of sparse priors in compressed sensing or identification of linear-nonlinear cascade models in dynamical systems and neural spiking processes. This suggests that the paper could belong to several sub-categories such as Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Signal Processing (cs.SP), Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
