It presents experimental results on image datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and EMNIST, indicating that the proposed method improves the performance of popular neural network architectures. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper discusses the theoretical analyses that support the regularization effect of the proposed method and its capability to be used together with Batch Normalization, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
