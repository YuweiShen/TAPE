This is a common approach in the study of social and information networks. \n- cs.DM (Data Mining): The paper proposes a new method for discovering novel multivariate relationships in time series data, which can be seen as a data mining task. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses machine learning techniques to identify and analyze multivariate relationships in time series data, which is a common task in artificial intelligence research. \n- cs.SD (Sound): Although not directly related to sound, the paper's focus on analyzing multivariate relationships in time series data could be relevant to the study of sound signals and their interactions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
