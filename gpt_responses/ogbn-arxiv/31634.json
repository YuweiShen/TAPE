The problem is studied on map graphs, which are a generalization of planar graphs, and hence the paper may also belong to computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also uses a contraction decomposition theorem, which is a technique commonly used in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The problem of finding a spanner, which is used in the paper, is a topic in graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper deals with approximation algorithms, which is a topic in complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
