The use of Hamming distance and sparse matrix multiplication also suggests a connection to data structures and graph algorithms, which are covered by cs.DS and cs.CG. The paper also involves theoretical aspects of computation, such as reductions and complexity classes, which are relevant to cs.CC and cs.DM.
