The \\lean{norm_cast} tactics aim to make reasoning with such expressions as transparent as possible, which is a concern in programming language design.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper describes a tool for improving the usability of a software system (the Lean proof assistant) by making reasoning with certain expressions more transparent. This falls under the scope of software engineering.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not directly deal with machine learning, but the \\lean{norm_cast} tactics could potentially be used in the context of machine learning if the Lean proof assistant is used to formalize machine learning algorithms.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with expressions containing coercions and casts, which are features of programming languages.
