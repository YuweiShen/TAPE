The interference is symmetric and affects neighboring messages, which suggests the sub-category of networked systems (cs.NI). The problem involves index coding, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.SI). The paper also discusses linear codes and decoding procedures, which are relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with achieving near-optimal rates, which is a topic in complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
