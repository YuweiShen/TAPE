The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in generating natural images (cs.CV) and in two applications to light-transport simulation (cs.GR). The use of coupling transforms and one-blob encoding suggests a focus on computational geometry (cs.CG), while the optimization for Monte Carlo integration involves probability theory (cs.PR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
