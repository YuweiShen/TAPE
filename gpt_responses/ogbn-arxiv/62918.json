This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) category. The paper also proposes a configurable framework that can be adjusted for speed or accuracy, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The paper specifically deals with fine-grained classification of vehicles, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper uses datasets of images captured in real-world situations, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
