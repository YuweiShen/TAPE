The paper also discusses classic graph problems such as Feedback Vertex Set, Longest Induced Path, and Bisection, which are well-studied problems in theoretical computer science (cs.DS, cs.CC). The paper also considers the complexity of the Dominating Set problem on point visibility graphs of points on a grid, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper examines the graph class from a structural perspective, which is a topic in graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
