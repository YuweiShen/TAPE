This involves the use of various technologies and processes to improve production efficiency and reduce waste. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.SE (Software Engineering), which deals with the design, development, and maintenance of software systems. Other likely sub-categories include cs.CE (Computational Engineering), cs.CY (Computers and Society), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.PL (Programming Languages), as these areas may also be relevant to the development and implementation of the proposed system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
