The paper also discusses the design of a highly underactuated exoskeleton with a tendon-driven mechanism to actuate the finger. These topics are closely related to the fields of robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), robotics and automation (cs.ROB), multimedia (cs.MM), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
