The methodology proposed, universal differential equations (UDEs), involves the use of differential equations to incorporate scientific constraints, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the discovery of previously unknown governing equations, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of UDEs to accelerate model simulation is related to the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the application of UDEs to climate simulations, which falls under the category of computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
