This involves logical reasoning about the properties of the models and their behaviour, which suggests a connection to the sub-category of Logic in Computer Science. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the expressiveness and limitations of two programming models, and proposes a restriction on one of them to capture a notion of executability. This is a central concern of the sub-category of Programming Languages. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper addresses the problem of modelling and specifying interactive behaviour in computational systems, which is a key aspect of software engineering. The proposed restriction on the $\\pi$-calculus can be seen as a way to improve the reliability and predictability of software systems. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper deals with formal models of computation, and establishes a correspondence between them based on behavioural equivalence. This is a central topic in the sub-category of Formal Languages and Automata Theory. \n- cs.THEORY (Theoretical Computer Science): The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the relationship between two formal models of computation, and proposes a new restriction on one of them to capture a notion of executability. This is a typical concern of the sub-category of Theoretical Computer"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
