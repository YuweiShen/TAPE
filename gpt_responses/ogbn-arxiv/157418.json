The algorithm uses line features to improve the robustness of the system in challenging scenes, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV). The algorithm also uses the theory of invariant Kalman filtering and Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF), which falls under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Control Systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of exponential mapping of Lie algebra, which is a technique used in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
