The paper proposes a toolflow for mapping multiple CNNs on FPGAs, which involves designing a novel multi-CNN hardware architecture and an automated design space exploration method. This involves considerations of hardware architecture, computer vision, embedded systems, and programming languages. The paper also discusses scheduling algorithms and performance-per-Watt, which are relevant to systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
