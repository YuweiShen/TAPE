The proposed solutions involve deep neural networks, which are a common tool in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of new neurons to learn task-specific features, which is a technique used in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with classification tasks, which is a common topic in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
