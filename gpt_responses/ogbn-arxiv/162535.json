The paper also discusses the expansion properties of graphs, which is a topic in spectral graph theory (cs.SI) and graph theory (cs.GT). The paper presents algorithmic results for selecting contagious sets, which falls under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the computational complexity of the problem, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
