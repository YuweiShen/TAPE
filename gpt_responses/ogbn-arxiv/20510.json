The use of spatial bottleneck modules is a novel approach to achieving this acceleration, which could also fall under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of these modules in natural language processing tasks, which could place it in the categories of neural networks (cs.NE) or computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
