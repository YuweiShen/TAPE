The proposed approaches involve machine learning techniques such as seq2seq learning and permutation invariant training, which are also commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of neural networks, which are a popular tool in the field of neural engineering (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses experiments on a benchmark dataset, which is a common practice in computer vision (cs.CV) and other subfields of computer science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
