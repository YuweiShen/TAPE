The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques, such as training and inference, which fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed architecture, Cascade R-CNN, is a multi-stage approach that involves sequentially training detectors with increasing IoU thresholds, which is related to the field of robotics (cs.RO) and specifically object recognition in robotics. Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed method on various datasets, including COCO and VOC, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
