The paper also introduces a new approach using deep features, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the reconstruction of articulated humans, which could potentially fall under neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
