This makes it likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. The paper also uses graph-based proofs and hypergraph closure, which are common techniques in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with the tractability of the problem, which is a topic that falls under the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
