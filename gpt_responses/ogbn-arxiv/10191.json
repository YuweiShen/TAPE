The paper also uses neural networks and probabilistic modeling, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves information retrieval (cs.IR) as it aims to extract structured relations from large text corpora. Finally, the paper uses an expectation maximization framework, which is a common technique in statistical learning (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
