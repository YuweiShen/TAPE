The use of deep neural networks also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The mention of the 2018 MICCAI challenge suggests that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of a novel loss function suggests that it could belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
