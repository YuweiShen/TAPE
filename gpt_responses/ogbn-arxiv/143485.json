It could also belong to the Communications (cs.COMM) sub-category as it discusses the gains achieved in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) through the proposed modulation format. Additionally, it could be categorized under Networked Systems (cs.NI) as it deals with the transmission of information over a network. The paper could also be classified under Signal Processing (cs.SI) as it involves the processing of signals to achieve higher information rates. Finally, it could be categorized under Multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with the transmission of data in a multimedia context."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
