The use of provenance in databases (cs.DB) is a well-established area of research, and the paper's focus on aggregation and identification of diverse elements of computational experiments is similar to the goals of provenance research in databases. The paper also discusses the use of software and its past execution, which is relevant to software engineering (cs.SE). The paper's focus on constructing a subset of a research object for partial reuse is relevant to deep learning (cs.DL), which often involves reusing pre-trained models. The paper's focus on summarizing provenance to aid in understanding the contents and past executions of a research object is relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR), which often involves summarizing large amounts of data. Finally, the paper's focus on constructing a graph view similar to application workflow is relevant to programming languages (cs.PL), which often involve constructing and analyzing program graphs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
