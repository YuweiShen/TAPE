The paper also mentions NGN (Next Generation Networks), which falls under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper proposes and implements novel overload control algorithms, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper mentions that the traditional notion of TCP flow control alone is incapable of managing overload for time-critical session-based applications, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
