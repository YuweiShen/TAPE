The use of multiple antennas at the fusion center and the analysis of their impact on detection and estimation performance suggest that the paper could also be classified under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SY) or massive MIMO (cs.MM). Finally, the optimization of sensor transmission gains and the consideration of power scaling laws are topics that are relevant to statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
