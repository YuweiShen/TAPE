The method involves breaking the quantization range into two regions and finding the optimal break-point, which involves optimization techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper presents experimental results on image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection, which are all subfields of computer vision and machine learning. Finally, the method involves approximating the weight tensors using a piecewise linear function, which is a technique commonly used in numerical analysis and computational science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
