The use of random matrix theory and large system analysis suggests that the paper may also belong to the statistical theory (cs.ST) or machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The analysis of the ergodic sum rate and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio involves matrix manipulations and linear algebra, which are relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) and computation and language (cs.CL) sub-categories. Finally, the use of a regularized zero-forcing scheme for precoding suggests that the paper may also belong to the computer communications (cs.COM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
