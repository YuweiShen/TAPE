The paper also discusses the achievable massive MIMO effects, which is a topic in the field of signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the system through simulation methods, which can be categorized under computer communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
