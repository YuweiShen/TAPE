This topic is closely related to information theory (cs.IT), as well as distributed storage systems (cs.DS) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the construction of PIR array codes, which involves coding techniques for distributed storage systems (cs.DS) and database management (cs.DB). Finally, the paper analyzes the rate of these codes, which involves computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
