The use of attention mechanisms also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a new dataset and uses it to evaluate the proposed method, which could place it in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the spatial and temporal dimensions of blur, which could make it relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
