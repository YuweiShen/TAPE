The paper also discusses the use of data mining and imitation learning, which are common topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of vision and tactile sensing for guiding prehensile movements of a multifingered hand falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The development of a modular system for the recognition of continuous hand postures based on neural nets falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
