The paper proposes a method called FOCA to avoid co-adaptation between a feature extractor and a particular classifier. This is a problem that is commonly encountered in deep learning, and the proposed method is likely to be of interest to researchers in several subfields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
