The paper discusses the limitations of tSNE in scenarios where data are added or updated over time, which suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), social and information networks (cs.SI), or information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also compares the proposed approach to multiple benchmark approaches, which further supports the relevance of the paper to these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
