The proposed method involves introducing a class-specific constraint, which is a form of regularization, into the non-negative representation based classification (NRC) method. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the experimental results involve benchmark datasets commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
