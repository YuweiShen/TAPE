This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also presents a tight characterization of the achievable rate, which involves analyzing the structure of the transmitted codewords, and this is a problem that is often studied in the context of coding theory (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of computational resources to construct efficient codes, which is a topic that falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
