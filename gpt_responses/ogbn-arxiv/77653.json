This involves the use of neural networks and other machine learning techniques. \n2. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper addresses a key challenge in Educational Data Mining, namely to model student behavioral trajectories in order to provide a means for identifying students most at-risk, with the goal of providing supportive interventions. This has implications for the broader societal issue of improving educational outcomes. \n3. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper explores the use of textual data, which is sometimes available in the records of students at large, online universities. The authors propose a time series model that incorporates this textual data to improve the predictive power of student states for the purpose of identifying students at risk for course failure. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves the analysis of textual data to extract signals that can be used to improve the predictive power of student states. This has implications for information retrieval in the context of educational data mining. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a time series model that constructs an evolving student state representation using both clickstream data and textual notes recorded by human mentors.
