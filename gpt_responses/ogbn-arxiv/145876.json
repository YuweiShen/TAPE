The proposed scheme is based on polar codes, which have been extensively studied in both communities. The paper also discusses the capacity-achieving property of the proposed scheme, which is a fundamental concept in information theory. Therefore, cs.IT and cs.CC are the most likely sub-categories. \n\nThe paper also mentions that the proposed scheme is applicable to broad classes of channels as long as they are ordered via degradation. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to the signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI) communities, which often deal with channel models and their properties. Finally, the paper mentions the conceptual and computational simplicity of polar codes, which may be of interest to the machine learning (cs.LG) community, which often deals with efficient algorithms and models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
