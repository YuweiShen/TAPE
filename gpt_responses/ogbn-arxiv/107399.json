This involves utilizing idle degrees of freedom and null space of the interference channel. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), and Communications (cs.CR) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a spatial division multiple access mechanism for MIMO users, which involves utilizing the spatial domain for multiple access, and this could fall under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
