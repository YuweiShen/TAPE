The paper proposes a differential privacy algorithm to address these issues, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The algorithm is based on MinHash, which is a popular technique in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also involves the use of exponential mechanism and randomized response, which are techniques commonly used in information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
