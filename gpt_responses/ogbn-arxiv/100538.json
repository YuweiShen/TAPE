The paper specifically talks about the deployment and evolution of 5G and the potential risks of introducing 6G labels at this time. \n\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the lack of real technology advancements introduced by a potential 6G system, which is related to information theory. The paper also talks about the flexibility of the 5G communication system introduced by softwarization concepts, which is also related to information theory. \n\n3. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): This paper is primarily focused on the evolution of mobile communication systems, which falls under the domain of communications and networking. The paper specifically talks about the deployment and evolution of 5G and the potential risks of introducing 6G labels at this time. \n\n4. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): Although the paper does not directly discuss hardware architecture, it does talk about the lack of real technology advancements introduced by a potential 6G system, which could be related to hardware architecture. \n\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the potential negative impact of introducing widespread 6G discussions on the deployment and evolution of 5G, which could be related to systems and control.
