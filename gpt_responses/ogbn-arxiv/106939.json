This involves the use of a time-inhomogeneous diffusion process to condense data points together and uncover nested groupings at larger and larger granularities. The paper also provides visualizations to exhibit the method as a \"\"continuously-hierarchical\"\" clustering with directions of eliminated variation highlighted at each step. Given these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SD (Sound), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
