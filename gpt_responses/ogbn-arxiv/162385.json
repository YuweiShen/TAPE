The paper also mentions classification and regression problems, which are often studied in computer vision (cs.CV) and data science (cs.DS). The use of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as a measure of dependence is a statistical technique, which could also place the paper in the statistics (cs.ST) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
