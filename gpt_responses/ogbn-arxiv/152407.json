The paper also discusses optimization techniques for improving the efficiency of the model, which could fall under \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG) and \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). The use of neural networks also suggests the possibility of it being categorized under \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE).
