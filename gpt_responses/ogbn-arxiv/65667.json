Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper proposes a new network architecture for concatenating CNN features of different layers, which involves a feature selector generated by high-level features. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CL (Computation and Language), which are closely related to deep learning and neural networks. Finally, the paper also mentions image-to-image translation, which falls under the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
