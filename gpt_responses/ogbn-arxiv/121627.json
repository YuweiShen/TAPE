The paper also proposes and analyzes a decoding algorithm, which falls under the category of information theory and probability (cs.ITP). The broadcast channel is a type of network, which is related to computer networks (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the method of types, which is a statistical technique used in information theory and communication (cs.SI).
