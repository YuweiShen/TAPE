The paper also mentions the use of DBNs in image processing (cs.CV) and speech processing (cs.CL), which are specific applications of machine learning. Finally, the paper introduces a new MATLAB toolbox for implementing DBNs, which falls under the category of machine learning libraries (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
