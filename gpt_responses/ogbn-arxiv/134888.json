The paper also proposes a scalable algorithm for large-scale kernelized learning problems. These topics are closely related to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and social and information networks (cs.SI). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
