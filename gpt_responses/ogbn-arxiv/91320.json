The paper also mentions multi-agent learning and human-machine interactions, which are relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper proposes a software architecture for designing deep RL-based systems, which is relevant to software engineering (cs.SE) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
