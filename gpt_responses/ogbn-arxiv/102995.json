The use of a recurrent encoder-decoder model suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions the use of a new dataset for Turkish morphology, which could potentially fall under computer vision (cs.CV) if the dataset includes images or other visual data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
