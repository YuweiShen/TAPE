This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories, as these areas often deal with image analysis and recommendation systems. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of neural networks, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL).
