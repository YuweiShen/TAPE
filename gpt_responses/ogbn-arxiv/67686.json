The use of a Gaussian mixture density for modeling the distribution of the source suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) approach. The analysis of upper- and lower-bounds on reconstruction error performance is a common theme in optimization (cs.MM) and statistics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
