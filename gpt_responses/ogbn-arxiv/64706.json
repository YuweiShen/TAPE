The paper also proposes an encoding approach to reduce model complexity, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve training neural networks, which is a common topic in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with word embeddings, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
