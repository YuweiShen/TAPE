It also involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) as it considers the responses of crowdsourcers to pairwise comparison questions. The use of partial orders and iterative question-selection framework suggests that the paper may fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also has applications in information retrieval (cs.IR) and social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
