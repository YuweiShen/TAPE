This is a common problem in reinforcement learning, which falls under the umbrella of machine learning. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with learning in an MDP, which is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence. \n3. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper's focus on learning to explore an environment is relevant to robotics, where exploration is a crucial component of many tasks. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper's use of a black box planning oracle and an approximate MDP solver is relevant to the systems and control community, which deals with designing and analyzing complex systems. \n5. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper's focus on learning to explore an environment without a reward signal is relevant to multiagent systems, where agents may not have access to a global reward signal and must learn to explore their environment to achieve their objectives."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
