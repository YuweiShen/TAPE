The use of time-of-arrival and received signal strength techniques also suggests a possible connection to information theory (cs.IT). The development of novel localization techniques based on statistical modelling may also fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the experimental validation and assessment of the proposed model may involve multimedia (cs.MM) in terms of data visualization and analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
