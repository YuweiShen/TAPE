The use of a multi-letter successive decoding rule and the derivation of achievable rate regions and error exponents suggest that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of statistical inference (cs.SI). The comparison of rate regions with a commonly-considered decoder and the numerical examples provided suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of superposition coding in the cognitive MAC case suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the theoretical analysis and derivation of achievable rate regions and error exponents suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
