Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems and their capacity limits, making this category the most likely fit for this paper.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The proposed N-NOMA scheme involves distributed analog beamforming by the base stations (BSs) to meet the cell-edge user's quality of service (QoS) requirements. This aspect of the paper is related to networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking) - The paper deals with the downlink coordinated multipoint (CoMP) communication scenario of a cellular network, which is a key area of research in communication and networking.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The proposed N-NOMA scheme involves distributed analog beamforming by the base stations (BSs) to meet the cell-edge user's quality of service (QoS) requirements. This aspect of the paper is related to systems and control.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper does not explicitly deal with multimedia, but the proposed N-NOMA scheme could potentially be used for multimedia applications in cellular networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
