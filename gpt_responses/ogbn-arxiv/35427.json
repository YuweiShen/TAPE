The use of MIMO and beamforming techniques also falls under this category.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper focuses on a multicast scenario in an ad hoc network, which is a key area of research in networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) - The use of a pre-defined multi-hop routing tree involves multiple agents (nodes) working together to achieve a common goal, which falls under the scope of multi-agent systems.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The scheduling algorithm presented in the paper involves controlling the transmission of packets over multiple frames, which falls under the scope of systems and control.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the transmission of a streaming message broken down into packets, which is a key area of research in multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
