The focus on approximation algorithms and the use of graph minors suggest cs.DS and cs.DM as the most likely categories, followed by cs.CG and cs.CC. The mention of bicriteria approximation algorithms also suggests cs.CG as a likely category. The mention of terminals and set expansion may suggest cs.GT as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
