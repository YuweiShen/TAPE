This makes it likely to belong to the Logic (cs.LO) and Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-categories. The paper also introduces a novel proof system tailored to Horn constraint solving, which makes it relevant to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The paper specifically mentions the verification of programs written in functional languages such as OCaml, which makes it relevant to the Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL) sub-category. Finally, the paper also mentions the use of an SMT solver, which makes it relevant to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
