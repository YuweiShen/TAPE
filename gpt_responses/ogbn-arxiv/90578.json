However, the paper specifically focuses on using machine learning techniques to analyze student submissions and provide feedback, which is more closely related to natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (cs.CL). The paper also mentions the use of clustering algorithms to group similar submissions, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the importance of ensuring that all students can cope with the material, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE) and cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
