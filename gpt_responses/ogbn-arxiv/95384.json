The paper also discusses the variance of the estimator, which is a statistical problem and falls under the category of statistics (cs.ST). The comparison of different stacking scenarios and their impact on the variance of the estimator involves machine learning techniques and optimization, which are relevant to the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the asymptotic behavior of the estimators, which is a topic in statistical inference and falls under the category of statistics and probability (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with models where not all kinds of stackings are possible, which is a topic in systems and control theory and falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
