The paper also mentions the use of mathematical models, complex networks theory, and multi-agent systems, which are all relevant to the sub-categories of cs.SI (social and information networks), cs.MA (multi-agent systems), cs.SY (systems and control), cs.SOC (computational social science), and cs.CYBER (cybersecurity).
