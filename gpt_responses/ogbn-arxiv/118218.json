This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category, which deals with the fundamental limits of information transmission and processing. Additionally, the paper focuses on the uplink aspect of the system, which suggests that it may also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category, which deals with the design and analysis of computer networks. The paper also involves optimization problems, which suggests that it may belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category, which deals with the modeling, analysis, and control of complex systems. Furthermore, the paper deals with millimeter-wave communications, which suggests that it may belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category, which deals with the processing and transmission of multimedia data. Finally, the paper deals with wireless mobile communication, which suggests that it may also belong to the Computer Communications (cs.COM) sub-category, which deals with the design and analysis of communication protocols and systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
