The proposed method involves recursive whitening transformation, which is a statistical signal processing technique. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SD (Sound), followed by cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves the use of deep neural networks, which falls under cs.SI (Systems and Control) and cs.SDQ (Signal Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
