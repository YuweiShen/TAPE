The paper also discusses randomized incremental methods and stochastic methods, which are common techniques in optimization and algorithms, and could potentially fall under the cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-categories. The use of the global oracle model and the analysis of complexity bounds suggest that the paper could also be relevant to the cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) sub-category. Finally, the mention of compatibility with stochastic oracles and the use of SVRG suggest that the paper could also be relevant to the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category, which deals with control and optimization of complex systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
