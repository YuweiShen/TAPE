The paper proposes a new block-based pruning framework that can be applied to both CNNs and RNNs, implying complete support for the two major kinds of computation-intensive layers (i.e., CONV and FC layers). This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
