The paper presents quantitative hardness results for SVP_p, which is a problem in computational geometry and optimization. The paper uses techniques from computational complexity theory and algebraic geometry, which are typically studied in the sub-categories of cs.DS, cs.CC, cs.IT, cs.CG, and cs.LG. Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
