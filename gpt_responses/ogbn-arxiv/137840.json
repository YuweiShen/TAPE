The techniques used in the paper involve data structures and algorithms commonly studied in the subfields of data structures (cs.DS), computational geometry (cs.CG), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), network optimization (cs.NE), and theoretical computer science (cs.SI). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
