This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. The method proposed involves using second-order statistics (covariance) of high-level convolutional features, which is a topic of interest in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on the ImageNet dataset, which is a popular benchmark in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
