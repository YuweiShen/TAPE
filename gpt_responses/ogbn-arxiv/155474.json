Therefore, cs.DB is the most likely sub-category. The paper also introduces new data structures and algorithms to improve the performance of stream join, which are relevant to the data structures (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC) communities. Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of hardware accelerators on FPGA, which falls under the sub-category of computer architecture (cs.AR) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
