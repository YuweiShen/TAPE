The paper also discusses the amount of communication required to solve these problems, which is a key topic in information theory. \n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the tradeoff between the number of communication rounds and the amount of communication required to solve the CRG and SKG problems. This is a topic that is closely related to computational complexity. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper deals with the generation of secret keys, which is a fundamental problem in cryptography. The paper also discusses the security of the generated keys, which is a key topic in cryptography and security. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the construction of a family of distributions, which is a topic that is closely related to data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) - The paper deals with the generation of randomness and secret keys, which are problems that are closely related to discrete mathematics.
