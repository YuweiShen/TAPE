This falls under the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Robotics (cs.RO). The use of Deep Learning techniques such as DQN and Deep Q learning frameworks with quadratic approximator suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves the implementation of Pure Pursuit Control for path tracking, which falls under the sub-category of Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the use of polynomial lane change trajectory and potential extension to other autonomous driving scenarios suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
