The paper also discusses the use of a theorem prover (Abella) for interactive reasoning, which falls under the sub-category of software engineering (cs.SE). The paper's focus on binding structures and their associated notions of scope, free and bound variables, and capture-avoiding substitution suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-categories of logical frameworks (cs.LF) and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
