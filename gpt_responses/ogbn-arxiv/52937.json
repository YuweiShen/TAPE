It also involves the use of neural networks, which makes it relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. As the paper deals with adversarial attacks, it could also be classified under the computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, since the paper proposes a new approach for generating adversaries, it could also be relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
