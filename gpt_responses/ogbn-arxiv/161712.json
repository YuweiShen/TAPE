This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses a dual capacity expression, which is a common technique in signal processing (cs.SI) and communication networks (cs.NI). The paper also mentions numerical simulations, which could fall under machine learning (cs.MM) or machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
