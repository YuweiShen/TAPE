The paper also involves the use of statistical methods to model the interference, which falls under the category of numerical analysis (cs.NI). The study of correlated interferers is a topic related to signal processing (cs.SI). The use of special functions to simplify the coverage probability expressions is a topic related to mathematical analysis (cs.MA). Finally, the comparison of coverage probability in different scenarios involves game theory concepts (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
