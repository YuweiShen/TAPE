The most likely sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), as the paper focuses on security and privacy aspects of MapReduce. The second likely sub-category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), as MapReduce is a distributed computing system. The third likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as MapReduce is used for processing large-scale data.
