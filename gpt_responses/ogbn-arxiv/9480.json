The focus is on DC microgrids (cs.DC) and the use of potential theory (cs.PF) to derive design constraints. The paper also discusses the installation and operation of these networks by individual communities, which could fall under the category of computer engineering (cs.CE) as it involves the design and implementation of hardware systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
