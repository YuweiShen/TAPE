This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The modifications to the training objective and pipeline suggest a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of reflectance indices suggests a potential application in graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the use of satellite imagery suggests a potential application in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
