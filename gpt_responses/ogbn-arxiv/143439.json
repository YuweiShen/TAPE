The paper also discusses the computational constraints on the algorithm that determines adjacency, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC). The study of planar and interval graphs, which are examples of graph classes that can be represented by labeling schemes, falls under computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also discusses the space efficiency of labeling schemes, which is related to information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper considers the graph classes that cannot be represented by labeling schemes, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
