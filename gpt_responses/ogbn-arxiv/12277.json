Additionally, the paper involves the use of random noise injection, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning research. The paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories, as it involves the use of deep neural networks and may have implications for the development of more efficient and accurate AI systems. Finally, the paper may be relevant to the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category, as it involves the use of non-linear transformations to uniformize weight and activation distributions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
