The use of a generator/evaluator approach is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) fields. The trial and error evolutionary approach used in this paper is also related to neural evolution (cs.NE). Finally, the examination of the method on a benchmark dataset falls under multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
