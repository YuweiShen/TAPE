The paper also discusses distributed, parallel training systems, which are related to \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG) and \"Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing\" (cs.DC). The paper's application to sponsored search advertising involves information retrieval (IR), which is another relevant subfield. Finally, the paper's focus on network efficiency suggests that it may also be relevant to \"Social and Information Networks\" (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
