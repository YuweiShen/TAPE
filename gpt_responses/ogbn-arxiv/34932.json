This involves the use of numerical methods for solving the optimization problems and evaluating the design criteria. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a goal-oriented approach for optimal design of experiments, which is suitable for scenarios where the solution of an inverse problem is an intermediate step and the estimated parameter is then used to compute a prediction QoI. This involves the use of machine learning techniques for predicting the QoI and optimizing the experimental design. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper uses tools from information theory to provide interpretations for the GOODE criteria. This involves the study of information flow and communication in networks, which is a topic of interest in social and information networks. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a sparsity-enforcing approach for optimal sensor placement using an $\\ell_1$-norm penalty, which is a common technique in machine learning for feature selection and regularization. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the optimal placement of sensors to identify the source of contaminants in a diffusion and transport problem, which is a topic of interest in systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
