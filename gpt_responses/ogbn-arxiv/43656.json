The use of graph embeddings to improve the quality of partitioning suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the practical applications of hypergraph partitioning in circuit design and sparse matrix operations suggest a connection to systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
