The paper also introduces a novel algorithm for computing the canonical set of non-$\\alpha$-equivalent programs, which involves programming language theory (cs.PL) and formal methods (cs.CR). The evaluation results involve machine learning (cs.LG) and systems and control (cs.SY) due to the stress-testing of compilers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
