Given that the paper focuses on the application of deep learning techniques to non-neural network classifiers, it is most likely to belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG), followed by computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). However, since the paper also discusses regularization and optimization methods, it could also be relevant to the sub-categories of natural language processing (cs.CL) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
