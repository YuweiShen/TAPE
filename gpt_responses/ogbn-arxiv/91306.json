The use of distributional constraints and quotas suggests a focus on optimization and algorithmic aspects, which are also relevant to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the feasibility and stability of matchings, which are topics in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG) and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
