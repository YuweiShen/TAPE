The paper proposes a meta-learning algorithm for fine-tuning a learned model with a few similar examples given a test case, which could benefit the prediction by leveraging the structural and semantic information conveyed in such similar examples. This approach involves machine learning (ML) techniques such as transfer learning, meta-learning, and neural networks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and ML. The paper also introduces a masking scheme and augment the loss function with an additional maximum term during meta-training, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with named entity recognition, which is a subfield of information retrieval (IR) and could be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
