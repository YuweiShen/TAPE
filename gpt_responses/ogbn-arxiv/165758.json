This work involves the integration of two different areas of computer science, namely, AI and logic programming (cs.AI, cs.LO, cs.PL), as well as constraint programming (cs.CP) and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also discusses the performance of the new clingcon system, which involves empirical evaluation and comparison with other hybrid ASP systems, indicating a focus on algorithms and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
