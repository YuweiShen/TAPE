The proposed method involves training a neural network with contrastive loss, which is a popular technique in deep learning (cs.LG). The use of transferred similarity functions also involves transfer learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions clustering, which is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
