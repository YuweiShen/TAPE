This involves extracting visual features using a convolutional neural network, applying unsupervised clustering to divide the photostreams into events, and selecting the most relevant keyframe for each event. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG) are also possible sub-categories given the use of clustering and neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
