It also involves the use of low pilot overhead to estimate a low-dimensional effective channel, which is a common technique in information theory. \n\nIt could also belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category as it deals with wireless communications and proposes a technique for improving channel estimation in 5G networks. \n\nThe Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper involves the use of the 2D unitary ESPRIT algorithm for channel estimation, which is a signal processing technique. \n\nThe Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category is another possibility as the paper deals with mmWave communications, which is a technology commonly used for multimedia applications. \n\nFinally, the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category is a less likely possibility as the paper does not involve natural language processing or any other language-related tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
