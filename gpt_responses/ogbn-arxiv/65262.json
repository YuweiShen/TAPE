The paper specifically addresses the issue of asymmetric label sets, which is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) tasks where the set of classes in the target domain may be a subset of the set of classes in the source domain. The paper also proposes an algorithm for selecting a relevant subset of source categories, which involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
