The method is based on scalable and unsupervised training of a graph convolutional network on a modified t-SNE loss. Therefore, it is likely to belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it involves training a neural network. Additionally, the paper deals with visualization of data, which is a common topic in Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Computer Vision (cs.CV). The use of graph convolutional networks also suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses evaluation metrics to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is a common practice in Computational Linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
