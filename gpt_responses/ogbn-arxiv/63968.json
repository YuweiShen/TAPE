The use of CP-logic (Causal Probabilistic logic) suggests a focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning, which makes cs.AI the most likely sub-category. The paper also deals with formal definitions and logic, which could place it in cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), respectively.
