Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses feedback control systems, which is a topic related to control theory and signal processing, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) another likely category. The paper also discusses algorithms and decision-making, which are topics related to information theory, making cs.IT (Information Theory) a possible category. The paper also discusses security and robustness, making cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) a possible category.
