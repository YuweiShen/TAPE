The paper also discusses attention modules and attention distillation, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper evaluates its method on major action benchmarks, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a novel method for attention distillation, which can be considered as a contribution to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
