The technique involves using sensors such as LiDAR and stereo cameras, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also uses Bayesian inference techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of uncertainty in robot pose, which is a common problem in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
