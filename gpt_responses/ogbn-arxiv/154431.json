This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG), with a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of multi-scale input channels, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
