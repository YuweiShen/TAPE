This suggests that the paper could belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) category. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach to leverage brain signals as a feedback modality, which involves machine learning techniques. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO), Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
