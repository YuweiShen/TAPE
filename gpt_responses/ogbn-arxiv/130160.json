This topic is closely related to machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of statistical methods and asymptotic normality suggests a connection to statistical learning (cs.SD) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
