The paper also discusses the use of Lipschitz functions for provable adversarial robustness (cs.NE), and the estimation of Wasserstein distance (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper proposes a new activation function (GroupSort) and discusses its use in achieving provable adversarial robustness (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the preservation of gradient norms during backpropagation, which is a topic related to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
