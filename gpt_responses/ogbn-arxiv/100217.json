The use of joint typicality decoding and nested linear codebooks suggests that the paper is likely to be in the sub-category of Information Theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper deals with multiple-access channels (MAC), which is a subfield of network information theory (cs.NI). The use of linear codebooks also suggests that the paper may be related to algebraic network information theory (cs.SI). The paper may also be related to coding theory (cs.CC) and multimedia (cs.MM) due to its focus on decoding multiple messages."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
