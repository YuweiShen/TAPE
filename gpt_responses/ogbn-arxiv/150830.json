This involves several aspects of computer science, such as natural language processing (to analyze the content of the news articles), social network analysis (to study the diffusion of the tweets), information retrieval (to collect and organize the data), and cybersecurity (to identify and classify disinformation websites). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.CY (Computers and Society).
