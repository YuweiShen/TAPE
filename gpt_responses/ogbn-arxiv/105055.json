The paper also discusses keyed authentication (cs.CR), which is a security topic. The methodology proposed in the paper involves constructing a discrete random variable, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also mentions the capacity region of the wiretap channel, which is a topic in communication theory (cs.SI).
