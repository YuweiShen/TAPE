It could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it proposes a novel procedure for training multiple Transformers with tied parameters and explores knowledge distillation for model compression. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it deals with improving the efficiency of neural machine translation models. The paper also mentions recurrent stacking of layers, which could place it under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions exploring the use of tied multi Transformers for image captioning, which could place it under cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
