It explores how cognitive technology can be used to offload some of the cognitive functions of cognizers, extending their performance capacity beyond the limits of their own brain power. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including human-computer interaction (cs.HC), natural language processing (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), cybernetics (cs.CY), and computational complexity (cs.CC). However, given the focus on language and communication, as well as the potential impact on mental states and nature, cs.HC and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
