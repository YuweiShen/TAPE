It could also belong to Information Retrieval (cs.IR) because the TextRank algorithm is often used for information retrieval tasks. Additionally, the paper proposes different functions that achieve a significant improvement, which could fall under the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
