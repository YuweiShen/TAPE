The paper focuses on the optimization of the transmission policy of the sensors to prolong their operation while causing minimum loss of utility to the application. This involves the use of dynamic programming and statistical analysis of information arrival, energy harvesting, and sensor lifetime. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.MA (Multiagent Systems), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
