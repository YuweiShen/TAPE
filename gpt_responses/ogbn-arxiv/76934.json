It could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as Bayesian optimisation is a popular technique in AI research. Additionally, the paper mentions mining exploration, which could place it in the sub-category of cs.DM (Data Mining). The mention of robotics suggests it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the use of Gaussian processes and hierarchical parameter learning suggests it could belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
