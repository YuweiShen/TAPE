Additionally, it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories as GAs are commonly used in these fields. The Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category is also a possibility as GAs can be used for system optimization. Finally, the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category may also be relevant as the paper discusses different crossover operators used in GAs for solving problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
