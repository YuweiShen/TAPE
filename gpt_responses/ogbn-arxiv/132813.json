The use of vector space models is a common technique in NLP, and specifically in sentiment analysis. Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category for this paper. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques, such as unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, which are commonly used in information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (LG). Therefore, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely sub-categories. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of high-dimensional vector space, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (AI) and computational complexity (CC).
