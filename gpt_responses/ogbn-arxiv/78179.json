The paper also involves the use of algebraic geometric codes, which are a topic of interest in coding theory (cs.CC). The study of the relative generalized Hamming weights of the codes is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the information leakage of the schemes, which is a topic in security and privacy (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
