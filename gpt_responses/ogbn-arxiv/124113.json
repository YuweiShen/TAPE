Therefore, cs.IR is a likely sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses state-of-the-art deep learning models for entity normalization, which falls under the scope of cs.AI.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper deals with biomedical text mining, which has implications for healthcare and society, making cs.CY a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
