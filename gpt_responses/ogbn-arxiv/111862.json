Information theory concepts such as channel state information and interference are discussed. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a non-linear optimization problem for multi-tone signals in wireless power transfer systems. Control techniques such as mixed-integer linear programming and finite branch-and-bound techniques are used to solve the problem. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the optimization of multi-tone signals, which are commonly used in multimedia applications such as audio and video transmission. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with wireless power transfer systems, which are a type of wireless networking. The presence of communication links and interference from nearby receivers are discussed. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a non-linear optimization problem and uses computational techniques to solve it. The focus is on engineering applications such as wireless power transfer systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
