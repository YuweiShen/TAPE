This falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) in terms of analyzing the query complexity of the algorithms. The use of lower bounds suggests that the paper may also be relevant to theoretical computer science (cs.THE) and complexity theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper deals with group theory (cs.GT) and may be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG) who work with groups and symmetry."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
