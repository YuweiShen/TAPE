It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as 3D object localization is an important task in robotics. Additionally, the use of a neural network for geometric reasoning suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the use of corner regression for 3D localization suggests that it may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
