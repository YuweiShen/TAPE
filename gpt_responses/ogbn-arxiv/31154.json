This involves generating additional reference frames using a deep frame interpolation network. The paper also introduces multi-domain hierarchical constraints to regularize the training of the network. Given this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.MM (Multimedia), which deals with topics such as video coding, image processing, and computer vision. Other likely sub-categories include cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
