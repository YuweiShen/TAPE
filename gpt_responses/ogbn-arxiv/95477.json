The use of algorithms and analysis of their performance suggest Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the mention of joint-sparse recovery and the ReMBo algorithm suggest that the paper could also belong to the sub-category of Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
