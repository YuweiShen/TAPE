The use of RKHSs is also a popular technique in machine learning, making this category the most likely fit.\n2. cs.SI (Systems and Control): The paper deals with stability of linear dynamic systems, which is a core topic in systems and control.\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the necessary and sufficient condition for a RKHS to be stable, which can be viewed as an information-theoretic problem.\n4. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper deals with the absolute summability of kernels, which is a numerical analysis problem.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): Similar to cs.SI, the paper deals with stability of linear dynamic systems, making this category a possible fit as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
