The proposed method uses a convolutional autoencoder, which is a common technique in computer vision. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper addresses the problem of privacy-aware image sharing, which is a security and privacy concern. The proposed method aims to protect the privacy-sensitive content of images. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with image sharing, which is a multimedia application. The proposed method aims to provide compact keys for authorized users to access the corresponding images. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a convolutional autoencoder for encoding and decoding images. Autoencoders are a common machine learning technique used for unsupervised learning. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper proposes a method for encoding and sharing images, which can be relevant for information retrieval applications. The proposed method can be used to store and retrieve images while protecting their privacy."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
