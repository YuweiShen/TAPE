The paper also develops a theoretical framework for studying volume sampling, resulting in new matrix expectation equalities and statistical guarantees. These properties make volume sampling a practical tool in the machine learning toolbox. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses numerical linear algebra, which makes cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) a likely sub-category. The paper proposes new matrix expectation equalities and statistical guarantees, which are related to probability and statistics, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.IT (Information Theory) likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the practical implementation of volume sampling, which makes cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
