The use of Bayesian variational inference is proposed to estimate model uncertainty and principled confidence. This suggests that the paper could belong to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the development of algorithms and models for machine learning. The use of DNNs and Bayesian inference in this paper makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category deals with the analysis and interpretation of visual data. The audiovisual activity recognition problem addressed in this paper involves processing both audio and visual data, which could make it relevant to this sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the development of intelligent agents and systems. The use of machine learning and Bayesian inference in this paper suggests that it could be relevant to this sub-category.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): This sub-category deals with the processing and analysis of multimedia data. The audiovisual activity recognition problem addressed in this paper involves processing both audio and visual data, which could make it relevant to this sub-category.\n- cs.SD (Sound): This sub-category deals with the processing and analysis of sound data. The audio component of the audiovisual activity recognition problem addressed in this paper could make it relevant to"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
