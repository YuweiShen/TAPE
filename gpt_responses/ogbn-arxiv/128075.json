Therefore, cs.DB (Databases), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of automated scripts, which suggests the involvement of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper applies its techniques to the case of Wikidata, which is a large-scale Knowledge Graph, indicating a possible connection to cs.DL (Digital Libraries)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
