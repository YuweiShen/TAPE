The use of interpolation and sparse algorithms also suggests a numerical analysis approach. \n\n2. cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper discusses the use of Leja nodes, which are a type of sequence used in numerical analysis and symbolic computation. The dimension-adaptive sparse interpolation algorithm also suggests a symbolic computation approach. \n\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with uncertainty quantification of systems, which is a topic studied in systems and control. \n\n4. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the application of the suggested approach to four numerical experiments, which suggests a computational engineering, finance, or science approach. \n\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the comparison of the suggested approach with a well-established polynomial chaos method, which is a topic studied in artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
