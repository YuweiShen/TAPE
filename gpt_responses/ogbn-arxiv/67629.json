The paper proposes efficient methods to address this bias, which involves training Q-approximators with labels consistent with the underlying greedy policy class. This falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
