It also involves combinatorial and geometric aspects, such as the study of flags and Weierstrass semigroups, which are relevant to computer science theory (cs.CC, cs.DS) and computational geometry (cs.CG). Additionally, the paper uses techniques from algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, which are related to the subfield of algebraic geometry and topology (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
