The paper provides finite-sample analyses for fully decentralized MARL, which involves teams of agents that collaborate or compete without a central controller. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which is the primary subfield of ML that deals with the theoretical foundations of learning algorithms. Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), which are relevant to the topics of MARL, decentralized systems, and control theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
