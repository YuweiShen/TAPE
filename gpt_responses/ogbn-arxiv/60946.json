The paper also presents state-of-the-art results for a variety of tasks compared to known self-supervised and supervised methods, which is a common theme in computer vision research.\n2. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper deals with dense correspondence mapping between non-isometric shapes, which is a common problem in graphics research. The paper also mentions the use of 3D scanners to generate complex and dense models, which is a common tool in graphics research.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper presents a self-supervised network for dense correspondence mapping, which is a machine learning task. The paper also mentions the use of learnable rules to generate point-wise descriptors, which is a common theme in machine learning research.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents a novel solution for a fundamental problem in computer vision, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence research. The paper also mentions the use of a self-supervised network, which is a common tool in artificial intelligence research.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with dense correspondence mapping between non-isometric shapes, which is a common problem in multimedia research.
