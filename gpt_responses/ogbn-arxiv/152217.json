The use of Lafont's soft linear logic and inspiration from recent works on session types as intuitionistic linear logic formulas further supports this. Therefore, likely arXiv CS sub-categories include cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.PL (Programming Languages), and cs.THEORY (Theoretical Computer Science). Additionally, the paper's focus on session types and interactions suggests a possible fit with cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
