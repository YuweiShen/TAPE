This involves computer vision (CV) techniques for image processing and analysis, as well as robotics (RO) for implementing the network in an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The use of a deep neural network also involves artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The paper also discusses the generation of real-time semantic coverage maps, which could fall under graphics (GR) or information retrieval (IR) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
