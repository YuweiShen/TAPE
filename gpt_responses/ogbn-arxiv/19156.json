The use of a CNN classifier for discriminative region discovery also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of image features for recognition also suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
