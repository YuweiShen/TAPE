The proposed approach involves leveraging attributes to justify the reasoning of black-box neural networks, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses adversarially robust learning, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the experiments involve working with benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
