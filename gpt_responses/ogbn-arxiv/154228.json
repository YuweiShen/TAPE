Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves probability generating functional (PGFL) and the distribution of inter-vehicle distance, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.MA (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the estimation of the meta distribution of the signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR), which is a statistical measure, indicating that it could belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.PF (Performance)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
