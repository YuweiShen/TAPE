The use of constant composition and arithmetic coding also suggests that cs.CC and cs.DS are relevant sub-categories. The paper also discusses the asymptotic behavior of the encoder, which could fall under cs.SI. Finally, the paper's focus on achieving maximum rate and minimizing divergence could be relevant to cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
