The proposed system uses deep learning techniques, which is a popular area of research in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep learning also suggests the possibility of neural networks (cs.NE) being used in the proposed architecture. Finally, the paper focuses on morphologically rich languages, which could potentially fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
