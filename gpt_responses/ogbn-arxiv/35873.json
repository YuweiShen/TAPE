This falls under the scope of computational geometry.\n2. cs.GR (Graphics) - Quadrilateral meshes are commonly used in computer graphics for modeling and simulation. The paper's focus on adaptive meshing is relevant to this field.\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper describes a family of meshes that can be adapted to a local size function by local subdivision operations. This involves the use of algorithms and data structures for efficient mesh construction.\n4. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) - The paper discusses the use of meshes for numerical simulations, which is a common application of numerical analysis.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - Quadrilateral meshes are used in multimedia applications such as image and video processing. The paper's focus on adaptive meshing could be relevant to this field."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
