The paper specifically focuses on compressed SGD with Nesterov's momentum and provides convergence analysis on nonconvex problems for general gradient compressors. The experiments are conducted on distributed ResNet training on ImageNet, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
