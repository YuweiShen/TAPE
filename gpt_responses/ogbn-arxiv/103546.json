The paper also discusses the use of convolutional maps, which are a common tool in deep learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of hand-crafted features, which are often used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions an increase in performance rate, which is a common metric in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with object recognition, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
