The paper also discusses the Schur squares of the new codes, which is a topic in combinatorics (cs.CC). The study of the subfamily of codes that resist existing structural attacks falls under the category of data security (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the new codes in code-based cryptography, which is a topic in systems and information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
