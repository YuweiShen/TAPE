This topic falls under the field of information theory (cs.IT) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of various modeling methods, which could fall under machine learning (cs.MA) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the future directions in tunnel channel measurements and modeling, which could fall under computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
