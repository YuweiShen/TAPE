It also involves the use of neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to solve multiple tasks simultaneously, which is a challenging problem in reinforcement learning. The paper also discusses the use of a new kind of recurrent neural network to model complex environments (cs.RO), and the approach can be applied to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
