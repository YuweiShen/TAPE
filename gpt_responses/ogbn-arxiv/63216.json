The paper also guarantees stability of the overall closed-loop ImG under mild approximations of line dynamics. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a Plug-and-Play (PnP) fashion for off-line control design, which allows for adding/removing a DGU without spoiling stability of the overall ImG. This suggests a distributed approach to control design. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper deals with DC Islanded microGrids (ImGs), which are an emerging technology in the field of power systems. \n- cs.PF (Power and Energy): The paper proposes a new control scheme for DC Islanded microGrids (ImGs), which are a type of power system. The paper also analyzes the performance of the proposed controllers simulating different scenarios in PSCAD. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper does not focus on programming languages, but it does propose a new decentralized control scheme that uses only information on the corresponding DGU and lines connected to it, which suggests a programming language-agnostic approach to control design."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
