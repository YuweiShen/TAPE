The paper also discusses the scaling of synchronous distributed DNN training, which falls under the category of distributed and parallel computing (cs.Distributed and Parallel Computing). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of second-order information in the NLCG pre-conditioner, which is a topic related to numerical analysis (cs.NE) and optimization (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
