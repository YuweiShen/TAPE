The focus of the paper is on a specific variant of the problem where there is a fixed and known metric on the action space that determines a cost for switching between any pair of actions. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The Multi-Armed Bandit problem is a classic problem in machine learning, and the paper deals with a specific variant of the problem. The paper also proposes an algorithm to solve the problem, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in the machine learning community.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The Multi-Armed Bandit problem is a classic problem in artificial intelligence, and the paper deals with a specific variant of the problem.
