The paper also proposes a new algorithm that makes effective use of memory hierarchy and word level parallelism, which falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL) and performance analysis (cs.PF). Finally, the paper reports experiments on multi-core platforms, which could be considered under the category of architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
