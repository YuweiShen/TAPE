This topic falls under the category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). The paper also uses concepts from information theory (cs.IT) and coding theory (cs.CC) to build distinguishers for detecting the behavior of codes. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of matrices and low-rank approximations, which are topics in scientific computing (cs.SI) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
