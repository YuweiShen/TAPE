It involves the use of self-healing strategies to protect against link failures, which is a key concern in the field of network infrastructure. The paper discusses the implementation aspects of the proposed strategies and presents bounds and network protection code constructions. The topic of the paper is closely related to the fields of network infrastructure (cs.NI), information theory (cs.IT), control systems (cs.SY), cryptography (cs.CR), and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
