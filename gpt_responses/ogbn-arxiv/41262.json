The paper also proposes two new distributed optimal beamforming algorithms, which are related to control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.MM). Finally, the paper establishes convergence proofs for both algorithms, which is related to theoretical computer science (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
