The paper proposes a novel regularization method for NMT training, which involves introducing Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization terms into the NMT training objective to reduce the mismatch between output probabilities of left-to-right (L2R) and right-to-left (R2L) models. This suggests that the paper is likely to be classified under the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
