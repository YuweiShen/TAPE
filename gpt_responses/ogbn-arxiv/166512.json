The paper focuses on computer vision and robotics applications, which suggests that it is likely to belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.RO (Robotics) sub-categories. The use of deep learning also suggests that it could belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the calibration algorithm for the extrinsic parameters, which could suggest that it belongs to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses synthetic urban datasets rendered using Blender, which could suggest that it belongs to the cs.GR (Graphics) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
