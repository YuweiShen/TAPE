The paper proposes a new concept of \"method service\" to overcome the drawbacks of existing method fragments. \n\n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - The paper discusses the shortcomings of existing method fragments, which can be seen as a usability issue. The proposed method service concept aims to improve the usage orientation of method fragments, which can be seen as a human-computer interaction problem. \n\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper does not directly discuss social or information networks, but the proposed method service concept can potentially be applied to the development of information systems that involve social and information networks. \n\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper does not directly discuss ethical or societal issues related to computing, but the proposed method service concept can potentially be used to develop more ethical and socially responsible information systems. \n\n5. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper does not directly discuss programming languages, but the proposed method service concept can potentially be used to develop programming languages that are more user-friendly and easier to use."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
