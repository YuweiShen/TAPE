The paper proposes a novel technique called privileged features distillation (PFD) to improve the accuracy of prediction models by utilizing features that are only available during training. This work involves techniques from several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), natural language processing (cs.CL), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
