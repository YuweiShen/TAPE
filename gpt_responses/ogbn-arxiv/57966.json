The system involves a fabrication-aware design interface, automatic construction of solid 3D-printable joint geometries, and automatically generated cutting plans for rods. This work involves computational methods for design and fabrication, making cs.CE a likely category.\n- cs.GR (Computer Graphics): The paper presents a design interface that visualizes accurate geometries during edits and identifies infeasible designs. This involves graphics and visualization techniques, making cs.GR a likely category.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper involves the design and assembly of structures using precision-cut rods and 3D printed joints. This work may have applications in robotics, making cs.RO a possible category.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper presents a guided-assembly interface that prompts the user to place parts in order while showing a focus+context visualization of the assembly in progress. This involves multimedia techniques for visualization and interaction, making cs.MM a possible category.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although not a primary focus of the paper, the system involves the automatic generation of cutting plans for rods, which may involve computer vision and pattern recognition techniques. This makes cs.CV a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
