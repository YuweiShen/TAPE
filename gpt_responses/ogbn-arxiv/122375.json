The use of a predict-and-recompute scheme involves recursive updates, which is a topic related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also discusses convergence behavior and rounding error analysis, which are topics related to scientific computing (cs.SC). Finally, the potential application of these variants in a range of applications suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
