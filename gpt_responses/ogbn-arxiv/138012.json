This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the use of artificial noise in wireless communication, which is a topic in networked systems (cs.NI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the proposed scheme involves the use of a full-duplex transmitter, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
