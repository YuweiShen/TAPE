The paper also discusses the limitations of existing metrics and proposes a new metric that takes into account the completeness of ground truth, compactness of detection, and tightness of matching degree, which involves aspects of information retrieval (cs.IR), natural language processing (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
