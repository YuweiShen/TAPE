Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also mentions virtualization, which falls under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The problem of joint radio-and-computation resource allocation is a control and optimization problem, which could be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper formulates the problem as a non-convex mixed-integer programming problem, which is a topic in cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
