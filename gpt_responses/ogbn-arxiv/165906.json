The paper also discusses the optimization problem and the use of deep neural networks (cs.LG), as well as the use of residual units (cs.AI) and the non-convexity of the problem (cs.NE). Finally, the paper provides a quantitative analysis of approximate stationary points (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
