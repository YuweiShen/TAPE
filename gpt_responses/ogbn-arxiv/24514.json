The use of spoken language and images for learning semantic embeddings suggests it could belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) or cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The use of multitask learning and the exploration of inductive bias suggest it could also belong to cs.LG (Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the focus on end-to-end learning suggests it could belong to cs.SD (Sound)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
