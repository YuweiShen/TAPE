The paper also uses examples from the minimum spanning tree problem, which is a classic problem in computer science and algorithms. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). However, the paper also deals with linear maps and projections, which are topics in information theory (cs.IT) and computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper also discusses the limitations of EF, which is a topic in complexity theory (cs.CC) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
