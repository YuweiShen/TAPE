The paper discusses the use of differentially private decentralized algorithms and provides empirical results on regression and neural network problems for both synthetic and real datasets. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
