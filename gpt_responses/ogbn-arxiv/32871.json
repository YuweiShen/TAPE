Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also mentions applications in virtual and augmented reality platforms, animation industry, and e-commerce domain, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.MM (Multimedia). The proposed model uses deep learning techniques, which could place it in cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
