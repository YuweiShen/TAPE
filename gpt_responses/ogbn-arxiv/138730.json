The proposed method involves the use of a content adaptive resampler (CAR) which generates image resampling kernels, making it likely to also fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The use of a differentiable upscaling module also suggests the possibility of multimedia (cs.MM) and graphics (cs.GR) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
