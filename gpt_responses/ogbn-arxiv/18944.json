The paper also discusses the use of decentralized schemes for guessing the secret string, which falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC). The analysis of the guesswork exponent involves statistical inference (cs.SI), and the comparison of centralized and decentralized approaches involves computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
