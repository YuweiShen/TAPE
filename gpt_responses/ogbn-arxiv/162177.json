Information theory concepts such as channel capacity and coding are likely to be used in the analysis. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of a high-throughput free-space optics (FSO) link as the relay-destination backhaul link, which is a networking technology. The analysis of the system performance in the presence of multiuser interference and the use of dynamic-order decoding also fall under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.COMM (Communication and Security): The paper deals with the analysis of a communication system that involves the transmission of multiple users' signals over each resource block. The use of power-domain NOMA and the analysis of the system performance in the presence of multiuser interference are also relevant to communication systems. \n4. cs.OH (Optimization and Control): The paper discusses the design parameters that affect the performance of mixed RF-FSO and dual-hop RF/RF NOMA systems. Optimization techniques may be used to find the optimal values of these parameters. \n5. cs.PHYSICS (Physics and Society): The paper discusses the use of free-space"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
