The paper also uses various sensor measurements, such as optical flows and time-to-contact measurements, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV). The use of Kalman filtering and contraction analysis suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper proposes a novel algorithm for SLAM, which involves nonlinear techniques, indicating that it may also belong to the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
