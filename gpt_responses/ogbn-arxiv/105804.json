This topic falls under the broad category of information theory and communication systems, which is covered by the cs.IT sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of multiple antennas and subcarriers, which are commonly used in communication systems, and hence, the paper could also be classified under cs.COMM. The paper also proposes a detection algorithm based on Gibbs sampling, which is a statistical inference technique, and hence, the paper could be classified under cs.SI (statistical inference) as well. Furthermore, the paper discusses the use of multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM), which is a popular technique in wireless communication systems, and hence, the paper could be classified under cs.NI (networking and internet architecture). Finally, the paper discusses the achievable rate and bit error rate performance of the proposed techniques, which involves mathematical analysis and simulations, and hence, the paper could also be classified under cs.MM (multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
