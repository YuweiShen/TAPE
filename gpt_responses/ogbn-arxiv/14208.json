The paper specifically focuses on the choice of loss function in these models, which is a key aspect of training deep neural networks and falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also introduces new loss functions, which could potentially fall under neural networks (cs.NE) or multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
