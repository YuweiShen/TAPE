The paper also discusses the use of measurement techniques such as FROG and blind FROG, which are commonly used in the field of optics and laser pulse characterization. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.IT (Information Theory), followed by cs.SI (Signal Processing), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
