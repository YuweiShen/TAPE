This problem is commonly studied in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), multi-agent systems (MA), robotics (RO), and logic (LG). The paper also discusses the use of propositional satisfiability (SAT) for solving CPF, which is a common technique in the field of programming languages and compilers (PL).
