Specifically, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of novel $\\epsilon$-greedy acquisition functions on benchmark problems and real-world applications. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
