It also uses Prolog as the programming language, which falls under the category of programming languages and compilers. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), and cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
