It also investigates the hardness of approximating connectivity problems, which are graph-theoretic problems (cs.DS, cs.CG). The paper uses techniques from PCPs literature, which is closely related to hardness of approximation (cs.NA). Finally, the paper deals with survivable network design, which is a topic in graph theory and optimization (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
