This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) category. The paper also discusses the use of domain-specific normalization and scaling operators, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of a singular patch-based counting regressor, which is a technique used in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the development of a new cell counting dataset, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
