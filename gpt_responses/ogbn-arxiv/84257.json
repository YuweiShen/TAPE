This involves designing and analyzing algorithms, which falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms.\n2. cs.BIO (Computational Biology and Bioinformatics): The paper deals with predicting RNA secondary structures, which is a problem in computational biology and bioinformatics. The paper also discusses the limitations of existing algorithms in handling pseudoknots, which is a common problem in RNA structure prediction.\n3. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper discusses the problem of predicting RNA secondary structures with arbitrary pseudoknots, which involves analyzing the geometric properties of RNA structures. The paper also proposes an algorithm for planar secondary structures, which can be seen as a problem in computational geometry.\n4. cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper involves analyzing RNA sequences and predicting their secondary structures, which can be seen as a problem in symbolic computation. The paper also discusses the use of energy functions in RNA structure prediction, which is a common approach in symbolic computation.\n5. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper proves that allowing pseudoknots makes it NP-hard to maximize the number of stacking pairs in a planar secondary structure.
