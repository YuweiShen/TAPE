This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also introduces a novel sequence probability estimator, which could be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
