The use of erasure codes involves information theory (cs.IT) and the optimization problem involves system dynamics and control (cs.SY). The paper also deals with scheduling policies and chunk placement, which are topics in distributed systems (cs.DS) and performance analysis (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
