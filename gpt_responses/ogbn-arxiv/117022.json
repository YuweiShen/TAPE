This involves learning a generative model of the environment and performing inference in that model to effectively aggregate the available information. This work is highly relevant to the fields of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), control systems (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV) as it addresses a fundamental problem in sequential decision making under uncertainty."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
