The paper also discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in these systems and the need to distinguish between different types of user behavior, which falls under the category of social and information networks (SI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in these systems, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (CL).
