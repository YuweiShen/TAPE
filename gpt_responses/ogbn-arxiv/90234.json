The use of annotated configuration spaces and topological arguments suggests a connection to discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science (cs.DS), as well as control systems and dynamical systems (cs.SY). Finally, the mention of universal reconfigurability results and convex cones suggests a connection to geometric topology (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
