This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including:\n\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): This sub-category deals with the social and ethical aspects of computing, including online communities and collaboration. The paper's focus on supporting new Wikipedia contributors and promoting sustainable growth and maintenance of the editor community aligns with this sub-category.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category deals with techniques for searching and retrieving information from large collections of data, including text. The paper's use of NLP techniques to analyze Wikipedia articles and editor contributions suggests a connection to this sub-category.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with NLP techniques for processing and understanding human language. The paper's use of NLP techniques to analyze Wikipedia articles and editor contributions suggests a connection to this sub-category as well.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This sub-category deals with the analysis and modeling of social networks and other types of information networks.
