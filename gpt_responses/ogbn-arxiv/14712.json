The paper proposes a new method that is suitable for large unknown graphs, is easily parallelizable, handles privacy-sensitive network data, and supports counting of large subgraphs. The paper also discusses various sampling designs and subgraph types that can be handled by the proposed method. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SOC (Computational Social Science), and cs.DB (Databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
