The paper specifically focuses on extending classic spanner constructions with purely additive error to weighted graphs. This topic is closely related to the fields of data structures (cs.DS), computational geometry (cs.CG), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), numerical analysis (cs.NA), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
