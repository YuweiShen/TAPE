It also involves adversarial methods, which are commonly used in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper deals with transfer learning tasks, which are often studied in the robotics community (cs.RO). The use of policies over options is a common technique in the field of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves continuous control benchmarks, which are often studied in computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) communities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
