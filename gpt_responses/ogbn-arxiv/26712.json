The problems are based on a discrete (combinatorial) operations/states design/solving space, which suggests that the paper could belong to the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of digraphs, which are commonly used in the field of systems and control engineering (cs.SI) and computer engineering (cs.CE), further supporting the possibility of these categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
