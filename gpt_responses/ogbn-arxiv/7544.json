The paper also discusses the security implications of decentralized systems and proposes a new data structure to reduce overhead, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of Merkle Patricia trees and sharding techniques also relates to database systems (cs.DB) and distributed data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses network bandwidth utilization, which is a topic in networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
