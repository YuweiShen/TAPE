The paper proposes a supervised machine learning-based method to predict which public threads will generate private messages, after a partial leak of such messages has occurred. The paper uses natural language processing (NLP) features to predict private activity. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Other likely sub-categories include cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.CY (Computers and Society), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
