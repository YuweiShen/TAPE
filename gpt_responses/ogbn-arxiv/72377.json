The use of the term \"tabular\" suggests that the focus is on discrete state and action spaces, which is a common assumption in reinforcement learning. The paper also mentions \"optimistic algorithms\" and \"regret decomposition\", which are techniques used in online learning and optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
