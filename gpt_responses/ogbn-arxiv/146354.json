Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). These sub-categories are relevant as the paper introduces a new mixture model for link RSS as a function of a person's location and provides a framework to update model parameters without ever being provided labeled data from either empty-area or known-location classes, which involves machine learning, information theory, and security aspects. The paper also experimentally validates the system at three test sites with seven days of measurements, which involves systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
