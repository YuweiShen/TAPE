The attacks involve stealing the model's functionality, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The proposed defense involves actively perturbing predictions, which is a technique used in machine learning (cs.LG and cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of existing defenses, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
