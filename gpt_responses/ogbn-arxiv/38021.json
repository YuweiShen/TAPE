The paper also discusses the tractability of the theory patching problem, which involves analyzing the stability of logical theories, a topic that is relevant to computational logic (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of labeled training examples, which suggests a connection to natural language processing (cs.CL). The problem of theory patching also has implications for cryptography (cs.CR) and data structures (cs.DS), as it involves manipulating and analyzing logical structures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
