The use of a rich type system for formalization and verification suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper's focus on ensuring soundness and completeness of parsing suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category of logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
