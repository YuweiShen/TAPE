It is also likely to belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the proposed method is demonstrated on popular image classification tasks. Additionally, it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as deep neural networks are a popular tool in AI research. It may also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as the paper deals with training neural networks. Finally, it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as the paper proposes a new measurement for selecting training data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
