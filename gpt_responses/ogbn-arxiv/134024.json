The focus on addressing the vanishing or exploding gradient problem through the use of orthogonality also suggests a potential fit with the sub-categories of linear algebra (math.LA) or numerical analysis (cs.NA), but these are less likely given the emphasis on deep learning and neural networks in the abstract."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
