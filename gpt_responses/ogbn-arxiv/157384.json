The paper also mentions the use of variational auto-encoders, which is a type of neural network commonly used in unsupervised learning (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of linear dense networks for time-series data, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the generation of an interpretable and explainable ECG beat space, which falls under the category of interpretability and explainability in machine learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
