This suggests that the paper could belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper presents a hardware implementation of LSTM networks, which falls under the scope of hardware architecture.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper deals with recurrent neural networks, which are a subset of neural computing.\n- cs.ET (Embedded Systems): The main goal of the paper is to support large recurrent neural networks for low-power mobile devices, which falls under the scope of embedded systems.\n- cs.EM (Emerging Technologies): The paper mentions that LSTM networks are a key technology for emerging applications such as automatic speech recognition, machine translation or image description, which suggests that it could belong to the emerging technologies category.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the development of a processing unit for recurrent neural networks, which could fall under the scope of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
