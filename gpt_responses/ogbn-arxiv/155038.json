This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of heuristics and pruning methods, which are common topics in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) sub-categories.
