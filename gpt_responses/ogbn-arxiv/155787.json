Additionally, the use of a deep feed-forward neural network filter suggests that it falls under the sub-category of machine learning, which is also relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper may also be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) due to the use of neural networks, and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) due to the focus on improving the quality of word embeddings for NLP tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
