The use of deep learning to generate kriging weights also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The statistical nature of the proposed method may also make it relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the use of end-to-end learning suggests that it may also be relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
