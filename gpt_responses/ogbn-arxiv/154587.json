The use of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and the derivation of asymptotic variance are typical topics in machine learning (cs.LG). The problem of distributed estimation with dependent data is also relevant to control systems (cs.SY). The use of Fisher information matrices is a common tool in mathematical statistics (cs.MA). Finally, the problem of distributed estimation with quantized data is also relevant to signal processing (cs.SP)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
