It may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it aims to automate the tuning of hyperparameters. The paper's focus on optimization and gradient norms suggests it could also belong to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. The use of multiple learning rates and the need to handle constraints on the domain of prediction may make it relevant to the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Finally, the paper's use of adaptive algorithms and its focus on optimization may also make it relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
