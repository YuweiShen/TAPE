It also involves spatial correlations between transmission antennas, which is a topic in networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of eigenvalues and matrix operations suggests a focus on mathematical methods (cs.MM), while the application to communication engineering (cs.CE) is also relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
