The paper proposes a new algorithm that is significantly simpler than previous algorithms and has a query complexity that is connected to the degeneracy of the graph. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
