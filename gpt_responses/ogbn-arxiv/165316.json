The paper proposes a neural 3D mapping network, which involves estimating the motion of 3D feature maps in videos of dynamic scenes, which falls under robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of contrastive prediction losses, which is a technique used in graph representation learning (cs.GR). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.RO, cs.AI, and cs.GR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
