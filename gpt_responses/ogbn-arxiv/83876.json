It is also likely to belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) because it proposes a framework for ad-hoc cross-lingual information retrieval. Additionally, it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) because it uses adversarial neural networks for inducing shared embedding spaces. It could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) because it proposes an unsupervised approach for cross-lingual information retrieval. Finally, it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) because it uses embedding spaces for representing terms, queries, and documents."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
