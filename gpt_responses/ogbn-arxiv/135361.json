This topic is closely related to network protocols and communication systems, which are covered by the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-categories. The paper also involves probabilistic models and simulation theory, which fall under the cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-categories.
