This is a machine learning technique for building probabilistic graphical models, which falls under the scope of cs.LG.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new approach for building probabilistic graphical models that can effectively approximate any continuous distribution and permits efficient learning and inference. This is a topic related to artificial intelligence, which falls under the scope of cs.AI.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the challenges of building probabilistic graphical models for hybrid domains, which involves mixed data types such as personal data, panel and scientific data, and public and commercial data. This is a topic related to data structures and algorithms, which falls under the scope of cs.DS.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the use of probabilistic graphical models for analyzing mixed data types, which can be applied to social and information networks.
