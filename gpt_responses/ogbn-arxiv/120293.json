It also involves the study of languages and their context-free properties, which falls under formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). The paper also makes use of information theory (cs.IT) concepts such as entropy and Kolmogorov complexity. The study of equivalence classes and their properties can also be related to computational complexity theory (cs.CC) and graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
