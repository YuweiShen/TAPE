The paper introduces a new quantity called the \\gamma-adapted-dimension, which is a function of the spectrum of a distribution's covariance matrix. The paper provides distribution-specific upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity, which hold for a rich family of sub-Gaussian distributions. This work is relevant to several areas of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), statistics (cs.ST), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
