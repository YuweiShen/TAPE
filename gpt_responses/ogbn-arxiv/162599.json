The use of imaging and ML to build individualized phantoms automatically suggests that it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The focus on healthcare applications and the use of retrospective studies suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.MED (Medical Informatics). Finally, the use of ML algorithms for prediction suggests that it could also belong to cs.NEURON (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
