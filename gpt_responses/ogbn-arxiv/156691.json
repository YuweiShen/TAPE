Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the impact of the problem on the depth to which networks can be effectively trained, which suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of skip connections in ResNets, which are commonly used in computer vision applications, suggesting that it may also belong to the sub-category cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses the mathematical simplification of networks with skip connections, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper discusses the use of batch normalization, which is commonly used in natural language processing applications, suggesting that it may also belong to the sub-category cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
