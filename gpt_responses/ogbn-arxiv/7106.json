The paper proposes a new algorithm that works in an adversarial setting, where the losses of the arms may be chosen by an adversary. This problem is closely related to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), game theory (cs.GT), information theory (cs.IT), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), and systems and control (cs.SY). Given the focus of the paper on machine learning and game theory, we believe that cs.LG and cs.GT are the most likely categories, followed by cs.IT, cs.NI, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
