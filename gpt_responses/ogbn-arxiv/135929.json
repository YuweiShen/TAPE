This falls under the domain of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The use of data on coring depth and top and bottom depths of productive horizons suggests the involvement of Computer Vision (cs.CV) techniques. The paper also deals with the challenge of characterizing the rate of salts in cores, which could involve the use of Database (cs.DB) technologies. Finally, the paper discusses the applicability of the developed approach for predicting other rock properties, which could involve the use of Software Engineering (cs.SE) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
