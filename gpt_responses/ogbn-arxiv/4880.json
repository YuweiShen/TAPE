The use of a Markov chain to model the memory suggests a possible sub-category of networked systems (cs.NI) or control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses coding algorithms, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or multimedia (cs.MM) if the algorithms are used for image or video transmission."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
