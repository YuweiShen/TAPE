The paper also focuses on visualisation of the policy, which suggests a focus on computer vision. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper deals with partial observability, which is a common challenge in robotics, suggesting the sub-category cs.RO (Robotics). Finally, the paper uses neural networks, which is a common technique in the sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
