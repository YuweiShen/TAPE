This involves the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for signal classification. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), which deals with the design, implementation, and analysis of communication networks and protocols. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques, specifically deep learning, for signal classification. This suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), which deals with the development and analysis of algorithms that enable computers to learn from data. \n\nAdditionally, the paper proposes a pre-processing data representation that leverages the amplitude and phase shifts of the collected samples. This suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), which deals with the development of intelligent agents that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve goals. \n\nThe paper also discusses the performance of the proposed framework under various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.IT (Information Theory), which deal with the analysis and design of secure communication systems and the transmission of information, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
