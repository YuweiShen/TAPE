It also involves the development of classifiers to detect mortality, which can be considered as a form of data science (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the trade-offs between models that emphasize pre- vs. post-mortem precision, which can be seen as a form of statistical learning (cs.SD). Additionally, the paper deals with the management of content and support for the bereaved, which can be considered as a form of social computing (cs.CY). Finally, the paper deals with the sensitive context of mortality, which can be seen as a form of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
