Additionally, the paper discusses the robustness of device operation and potential security vulnerabilities, which could also be categorized under computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The exploration of service and infrastructure dependencies in \"smart\" environments could also be considered a systems and control perspective (cs.SY), while the examination of device operation without connectivity could be categorized under software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the discussion of the impact of device deployment on infrastructure resilience could be considered under distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
