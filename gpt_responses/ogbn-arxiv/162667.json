The paper also introduces two novel techniques, uniform regularization and batch normalization, which are commonly used in neural networks and deep learning (cs.NE, cs.SI). Additionally, the experiments involve classification tasks on various datasets, which could be related to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
