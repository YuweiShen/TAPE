This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.DS: The paper deals with solving a combinatorial problem using a systematic approach. This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.LG: The paper proposes a new system of markings and a new way of simplifying puzzles, which can be seen as a machine learning approach to solving Sudoku puzzles.\n- cs.CV: The paper proposes a method to solve Sudoku puzzles, which involves recognizing patterns and making decisions based on visual cues. This falls under the scope of computer vision.\n- cs.PL: The paper proposes a new strategy for solving Sudoku puzzles, which involves developing two potential solutions and making decisions based on their interaction. This falls under the scope of programming languages and compilers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
