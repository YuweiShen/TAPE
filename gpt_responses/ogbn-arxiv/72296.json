The paper also discusses the use of Stochastic Backtracking-Armijo line search, which is a numerical optimization technique (cs.NA). The paper proposes novel variants of SAAG-I and II, which are optimization algorithms, and discusses their theoretical convergence properties, which are topics in the field of optimization (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of SAAGs for non-smooth problems, which is a topic in the field of non-smooth optimization (cs.AI). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on image classification, which is a common application of machine learning (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
