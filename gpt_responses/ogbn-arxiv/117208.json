The use of machine learning algorithms also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper also deals with fraud detection, which could place it in the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category. The use of neural networks and deep learning techniques could also suggest that it belongs to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the use of object detection networks and the modification of an existing model could suggest that it belongs to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
