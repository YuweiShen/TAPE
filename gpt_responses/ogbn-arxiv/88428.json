The paper also explores the existence of isometric embeddings of polyhedral surfaces, which could fall under the discrete geometry (cs.DG) and computational geometry (cs.CG) sub-categories. Finally, the paper may also touch upon some aspects of mathematical imaging (cs.MG), which deals with the mathematical foundations of imaging sciences."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
