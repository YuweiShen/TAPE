The use of brain voxels as features in multi-subject fMRI studies and source localization problems in Magnetoencephalography (MEG) suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The analysis of gene activation patterns in microarray data analysis suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the use of a sparse group lasso method for feature selection suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
