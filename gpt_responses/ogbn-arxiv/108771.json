This involves image processing and computer vision techniques. \n2. cs.IM (Image and Video Processing): The paper proposes a new imaging device that captures hyperspectral data using a digital micromirror device (DMD) and a CMOS image sensor. This involves image processing techniques. \n3. cs.OH (Other Computer Science): The paper proposes a new imaging device that has no macro moving part and is cost-effective, fast, and robust. This involves other computer science techniques. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper describes a new imaging device that captures RGB images of the scene along with hyperspectral data. This involves multimedia techniques. \n5. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper proposes a new imaging device that uses a diffraction grating to capture hyperspectral data. This involves graphics techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
