It also involves combinatorics (cs.DM) in terms of the definitions and classifications of fan-crossing and fan-planar graphs. The concept of density is also mentioned, which is a topic in graph theory (cs.GT) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the avoidance of independent crossings, which is a problem in algorithm design and optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
