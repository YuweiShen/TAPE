The paper also involves generating rich sentence-level descriptors of findings seen in AP chest X-rays, which involves natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also discusses building classifiers for these findings using deep learning classifiers, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG). The paper involves crowdsourcing of clinician annotations, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR).
