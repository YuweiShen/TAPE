It may also belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) as the paper focuses on scaling up the method in a distributed setting. Additionally, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also possible categories as they are related to optimization and machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
