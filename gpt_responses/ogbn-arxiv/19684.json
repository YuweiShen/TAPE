This involves developing an efficient runtime monitoring algorithm that can check SaSTL requirements over multiple data streams generated from thousands of sensors that are spatially distributed over a smart city. The paper also evaluates the real-time SaSTL monitor by applying it to two city application scenarios with large-scale real sensing data. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (for the use of AI techniques in monitoring), cs.CR (for the focus on safety and security), cs.SY (for the system-level approach to monitoring), cs.DC (for the use of distributed computing), and cs.SE (for the software engineering aspects of developing the monitoring algorithm)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
