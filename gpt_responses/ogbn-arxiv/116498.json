This is a programming language-related issue and solution, making cs.PL the most likely category.\n\n2. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses how modular design features in Excel would save time, avoid unneeded programming, make mistakes less likely, and make code-control easier. These are all software engineering-related concerns.\n\n3. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses how modular design features in Excel would open business opportunities in buying and selling spreadsheet modules. This is a computational engineering and finance-related concern.\n\n4. cs.DB (Databases): The paper briefly mentions how modular design features in Excel would help organisations adopt a uniform house style. This is a database-related concern.\n\n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses how modular design features in Excel would make it easier for users to work with spreadsheets. This is a human-computer interaction-related concern."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
