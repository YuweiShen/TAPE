Therefore, cs.CV and cs.HC are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a recurrent neural model for gaze prediction, which falls under machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.AI and cs.LG likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper discusses the use of optical flow and task-specific cues, which are related to robotics and control, making cs.RO a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
