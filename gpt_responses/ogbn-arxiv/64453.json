The use of active learning algorithms and noise-tolerance suggests a focus on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also mentions natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), indicating potential applications in those areas (cs.CL, cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
