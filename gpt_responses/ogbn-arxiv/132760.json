This is a common topic in social and information networks.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The methodology presented in the paper can be applied to real-world instances, such as the realignment of the Ecuadorian football league, which involves computational engineering and science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
