This falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and security and privacy (cs.CR). The use of DWT, DCT, and SVD for embedding and extracting the watermark involves image processing and computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. Finally, the paper also discusses the robustness of the proposed technique, which involves analyzing the performance of the watermarking method against different kinds of attacks, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
