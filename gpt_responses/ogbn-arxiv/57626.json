The use of small aerial vehicles also suggests a robotics (RO) component. The paper also discusses the efficiency/quality trade-off, which is a common theme in graphics (GR) and computational geometry (CG). Finally, the use of algorithms for view selection and optimization suggests an artificial intelligence (AI) component."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
