It also involves the computation of partitions and refinement methods, which are topics in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The use of vector spaces and subspaces suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG). The algorithmic approach and the mention of stabilizers and group actions suggest a connection to dynamical systems (cs.DS) and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
