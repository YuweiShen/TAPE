The proposed method is demonstrated on several challenging 3D shape matching datasets, which further supports its relevance to the computer vision community. \n2. cs.GR (Graphics): Non-rigid shape correspondence is also a relevant problem in computer graphics, where it is used for tasks such as animation and shape deformation. The proposed method could be useful in this context as well. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed method is derived from the statistical framework of kernel density estimation, which is a common technique in machine learning. The paper also discusses the limitations of existing methods and proposes an alternative approach, which further supports its relevance to the machine learning community. \n4. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): Shape matching and correspondence is a common problem in computational geometry, where it is used for tasks such as shape recognition and retrieval. The proposed method could be useful in this context as well. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): Non-rigid shape correspondence is also relevant in multimedia applications such as 3D modeling and virtual reality. The proposed method could be useful in this context as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
