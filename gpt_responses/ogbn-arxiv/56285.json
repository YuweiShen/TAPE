It also discusses the training speedups achieved due to the smaller network size and reduced computation per epoch. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it deals with neural networks and proposes a new approach to improve their performance. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of fully-connected layers in computer vision tasks, which suggests it could belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). \n\nAs the paper proposes a new approach to improve the performance of DNNs, it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the use of sparse matrices, which suggests it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
