The paper proposes a new approach to address the limitations of the conventional stitching approach, which is widely used in CV and ML for large-scale image segmentation. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of CNNs for remote sensing imagery, which involves processing large-scale images and requires efficient algorithms for inference. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nMoreover, the paper proposes a new approach that involves increasing the input size of the CNN during label inference, which can be seen as a form of optimization or algorithmic improvement. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories cs.GR (Graphics) and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
