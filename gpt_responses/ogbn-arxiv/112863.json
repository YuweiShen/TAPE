Specifically, the use of concept-mapped lexical-chains and emotion mapping suggests a focus on multimedia analysis (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of natural language processing techniques for analyzing time-sync comments suggests a focus on computational linguistics (cs.CL). The use of computer vision techniques for shot analysis suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the use of a framework for highlight detection and summarization suggests a focus on systems and information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
