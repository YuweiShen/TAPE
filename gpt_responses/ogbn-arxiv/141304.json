The paper specifically focuses on deep neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the relationship between probability of prediction and the effect of ensembling, which is a topic commonly studied in the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach using various datasets, which is a common practice in the field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
