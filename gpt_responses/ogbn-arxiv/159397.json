Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of data communication and storage. The paper also discusses the performance improvement achieved by the proposed strategies, which suggests that it could belong to cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture) or cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) categories. The paper also mentions the computational complexity of the receiver, which suggests that it could belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) category. Finally, the paper deals with transmission schemes that use nonlinear Fourier transform, which suggests that it could belong to cs.PHY (Physics and Society) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
