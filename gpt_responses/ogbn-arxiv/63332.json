The proposed approach also involves collision detection and safety systems, which aligns with the systems and control (cs.SY) category. The paper also addresses security risks associated with current vehicular radar devices, indicating a potential fit for the cryptography and security (cs.CR) category. Finally, the experimental demonstration and algorithm processing involve machine learning and pattern recognition, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
