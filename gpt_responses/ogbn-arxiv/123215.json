The proposed method involves using the covariance matrix, which is a common tool in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of Fourier transforms and Wiener filtering, which are common techniques in signal processing and graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the paper involves numerical optimization and estimation, which are common topics in numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
