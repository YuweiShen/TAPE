This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of computer science that deal with data analysis, machine learning, and statistics. Specifically, the paper's focus on heuristics and instance-specific confidence intervals suggests that it may belong to the sub-categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), cryptography and security (cs.CR), or artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
