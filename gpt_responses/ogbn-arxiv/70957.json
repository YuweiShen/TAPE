The paper specifically focuses on black boxes that assign numerical values to symbolic sequential data, which suggests that it could also fall under \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI) and \"Computation and Language\" (cs.CL). The proposed algorithm for extracting weighted automata from black boxes could also be relevant to \"Cryptography and Security\" (cs.CR) and \"Systems and Control\" (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
