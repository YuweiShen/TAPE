This involves techniques in compressed sensing, parallel optimization, and deep learning. The application example considered is channel estimation in MIMO-based grant-free random access for IoT. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are: \n\n1. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with compressed sensing and signal recovery, which are key topics in information theory. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep auto-encoder for noisy linear compression of jointly sparse signals, which is a machine learning technique. \n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions the presence of extra structures in sparse patterns, which is a common theme in computer vision and pattern recognition. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper considers an application example in MIMO-based grant-free random access for IoT, which involves communication networks. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with signal recovery for complex sparse signals, which is relevant to multimedia applications such as image and video processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
