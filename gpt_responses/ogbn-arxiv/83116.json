The paper proposes a new scheduling framework for ML training workloads, which involves allocation of resources and bidding, and aims to ensure fairness and efficiency. This work is relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) and control systems (cs.SY) as well, as it deals with optimizing the performance of ML models and ensuring fairness in resource allocation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
