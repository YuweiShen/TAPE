Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also deals with cache consistency, which falls under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper presents a Python programming interface, which relates to cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.PL (Programming Languages). Finally, the paper mentions autoscaling benefits, which are relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
