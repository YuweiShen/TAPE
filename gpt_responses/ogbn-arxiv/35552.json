The paper also discusses the trade-offs between various parameters impacting the power of interactive proofs, including communication complexity and information theory, which suggests that the paper could also be classified under the categories of Information Theory (cs.IT) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper connects distributed interactive proofs with the established field of distributed verification, which could place it under the category of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). Finally, the paper discusses the power of interactive proofs, which could also place it under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
