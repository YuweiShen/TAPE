The paper proposes a meta algorithm called Pumpout to overcome this problem. The paper also evaluates the proposed method on benchmark datasets, which suggests that the paper belongs to the machine learning subfield. Specifically, the paper focuses on deep learning, which suggests that it belongs to the subfield of deep learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions that it applies the proposed method to image classification tasks, which suggests that it also belongs to the computer vision subfield (cs.CV). The paper also mentions that it leverages the memorization effects of deep neural networks, which suggests that it belongs to the artificial intelligence subfield (cs.AI). Furthermore, the paper proposes a new method for training deep neural networks, which suggests that it belongs to the neural networks subfield (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of noisy labels, which suggests that it belongs to the subfield of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
