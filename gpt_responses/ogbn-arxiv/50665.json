This falls under the category of machine learning and data mining (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The method involves filtering and resampling the sample domain, which is a common technique in data mining (cs.DM). The experiments carried out on different types of datasets also involve image classification (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
