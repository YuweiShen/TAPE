The paper specifically focuses on the behavior of convolutional neural nets in the infinite width limit trained by gradient descent, which is a topic that falls under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper introduces a new benchmark for the performance of a pure kernel-based method on CIFAR-10, which is a standard dataset in computer vision, and thus falls under the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also connects deep learning to notions such as Gaussian processes and kernels, which are topics that fall under the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
