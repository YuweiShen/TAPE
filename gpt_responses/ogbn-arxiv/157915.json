The paper introduces a query language for order-incomplete data, which is a topic that falls under the database sub-category of computer science (cs.DB). The use of partial orders to represent order-incomplete data and the study of possible and certain answers for queries suggest that this paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), and software engineering (cs.SE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
