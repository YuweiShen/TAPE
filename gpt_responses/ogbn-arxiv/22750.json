This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of parity-check matrices in the analysis and construction of LRCs, which relates to the sub-categories of distributed systems (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also mentions the use of linearized polynomial theories and Vandermonde matrices in constructing LRCs, which are topics in signal processing (cs.SI) and computational complexity (cs.CC), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
