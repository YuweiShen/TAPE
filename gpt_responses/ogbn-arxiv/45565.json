However, given the focus on deep learning, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the application of regularization methods in computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper discusses the optimization procedures used in regularization, which could fall under the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
