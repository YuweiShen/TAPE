Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), which deals with communication protocols and network architectures. The paper also discusses the bandwidth efficiency and security paradigm of the standard, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), respectively. Additionally, the paper mentions the MAC layer and PHY layers specifications, which could be relevant to cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
