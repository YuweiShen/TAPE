Computer vision techniques are used to detect and classify the presentation attacks. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper deals with the problem of presentation attacks in Automated Fingerprint Recognition Systems and proposes a method for detecting such attacks. This falls under the domain of cryptography and security. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed Zero-Shot Presentation Attack Detection Model is based on generative model and utilizes task-specific gaussian model to improve the quality of clustering. This involves the use of machine learning techniques. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the problem of presentation attacks in Automated Fingerprint Recognition Systems, which is a multimedia application. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The proposed method involves clustering of fingerprint images to detect presentation attacks. This can be seen as an information retrieval problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
