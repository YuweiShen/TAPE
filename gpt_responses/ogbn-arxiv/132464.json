It also involves network infrastructure and wireless communication (cs.NI), as well as security and privacy (cs.CR) in the context of cognitive radio networks. The paper proposes a novel algorithm for optimizing the sequences, which involves mathematical modeling and optimization (cs.SI). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed sequences through simulations, which involves multimedia systems and applications (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
