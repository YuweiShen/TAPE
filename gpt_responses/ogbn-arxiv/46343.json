Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. The paper also uses neural models, which suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper investigates the benefit of the proposed approach on two different tasks, abstractive summarization and popularity prediction of online petitions, which could place it in cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
