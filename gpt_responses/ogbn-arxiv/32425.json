The paper also mentions the quantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic, which falls under the subfield of logic in computer science (cs.LO). The use of generic approaches and the focus on decision problems suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the subfields of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper mentions the use of modular predicates, which are commonly used in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
