The paper also develops approximation algorithms for various combinatorial optimization problems, which are typically studied in the Computer Science (CS) community. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS and cs.RO. \n\nThe paper also involves game-theoretic concepts such as risk-averseness, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.GT sub-category. The paper also involves machine learning techniques such as black-box distributions, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.LG sub-category.
