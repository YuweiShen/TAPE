It focuses on an effective warm start to accelerate the online learning process for new users. This methodology involves using accumulated data and decision rules from a former study to enrich the data size at the beginning of online learning and initialize the parameter in the online RL model for new users. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society)\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
