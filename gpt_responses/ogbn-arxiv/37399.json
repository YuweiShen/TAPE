Game theory is often used to model such scenarios, and the paper provides lower bounds on the performance of greedy algorithms, which is a common approach in game theory. \n2. cs.DS (Computer Science and Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper deals with submodular maximization, which is a well-studied problem in algorithms and optimization. The paper also proposes a local greedy algorithm for the distributed setting. \n3. cs.SI (Computer Science and Social and Information Networks): The paper considers the impact of the information structure on the performance of the distributed algorithm. This is a common topic in social and information networks research. \n4. cs.LG (Computer Science and Learning): The paper proposes a local greedy algorithm for the distributed setting, which is a common approach in machine learning. \n5. cs.IT (Computer Science and Information Theory): The paper deals with the problem of maximizing a submodular function given limited information. Information theory provides tools to study such problems, and the paper provides lower bounds on the performance of greedy algorithms based on the information structure."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
