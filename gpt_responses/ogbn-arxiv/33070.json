The use of algebraic tools for computing singularities and studying the workspace and joint space suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of symbolic computation (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the selection of the most suited configuration of the manipulator for a given task, which falls under the sub-category of mechanical engineering (cs.ME). The use of certified three-dimensional plotting and tabulation of different parameters associated with the complexity of singularities suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of computer graphics (cs.LO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
