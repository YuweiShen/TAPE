The paper also mentions the use of encoding and decoding techniques, which are commonly used in networked systems, indicating that it could also belong to the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-category. The paper discusses the coordination of states and messages, which could fall under the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of binning, which is a technique used in multimedia systems, suggesting that it could belong to the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category.
