It also involves training neural networks to learn how to run, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV) or robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of an ensemble of actors and critics suggests that the paper may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
