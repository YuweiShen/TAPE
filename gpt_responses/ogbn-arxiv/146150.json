This falls under the category of AI safety and security, which is covered by cs.CR. The designs for Oracles involve decision-making and optimization, which are covered by cs.LG. The Oracles also involve communication and information theory, which are covered by cs.SI. The potential applications of the Oracles in controlling AI also fall under the category of robotics and automation, covered by cs.RO. Overall, cs.AI is the most likely category as it encompasses all of these sub-fields and is the most relevant to the paper's topic."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
