This suggests that the paper could belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category, as well as the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper reviews research on distributed systems, which could place it in the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category.
