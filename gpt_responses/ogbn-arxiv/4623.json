This task is commonly studied in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) communities. The paper proposes a novel attention-guided erasing approach to improve the performance of referring expression grounding, which involves designing a model that can learn to discover complementary textual-visual correspondences. This approach involves generating difficult training samples online, which requires machine learning techniques such as deep learning (cs.AI), and the model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, which is a common practice in machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
