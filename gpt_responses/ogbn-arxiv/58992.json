The lack of interpretability in DL systems also makes system analysis and defect detection difficult, which is a common concern in software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also discusses adversarial attacks against DL systems, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed testing criteria is demonstrated on two well-known datasets, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
