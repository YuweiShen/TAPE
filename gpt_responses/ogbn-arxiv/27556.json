The proposed method aims to prevent model stealing, which involves modifying the weights of an already trained network, indicating that it could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category. The paper mentions classification accuracy, suggesting that it could belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision) category. The use of deep neural networks and their modifications could also place the paper in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category.
