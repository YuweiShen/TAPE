This involves implementing core Unix features like pipes, concurrent processes, signals, sockets, and a shared file system in a JavaScript-only system. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.OS (Operating Systems). The paper also discusses case studies that demonstrate how Browsix eases porting legacy applications to the browser and enables new functionality, which could fall under categories like cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.SE (Software Engineering). Additionally, the paper mentions extended JavaScript runtimes for C, C++, Go, and Node.js, which could fall under categories like cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.DL (Digital Libraries)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
