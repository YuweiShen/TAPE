This involves the use of convolutional neural networks for computing image similarities. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves information retrieval techniques, which could place it in the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category. Additionally, the use of neural networks could place it in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category, and the use of multimodal data could place it in the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
