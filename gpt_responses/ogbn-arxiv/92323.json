The use of high-dimensional geometry suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG). The development of an extension of the classical isoperimetric inequality may be of interest to researchers in numerical analysis (cs.NA) and statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the use of upper bounds and tension quantification may be relevant to researchers in machine learning and optimization (cs.MS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
