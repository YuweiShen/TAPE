This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) as it involves studying the optimal tradeoff among message rates and server broadcast rates. It also involves networked systems (cs.NI) as it deals with multiple servers and receivers. The paper establishes inner and outer bounds on the capacity region, which involves mathematical analysis and optimization, making it relevant to distributed systems (cs.DS) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper proposes a new composite coding scheme, which is related to coding theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
