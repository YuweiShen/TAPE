The paper also discusses network design choices and balancing speed and accuracy, which are topics related to machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of feature gating, which is a technique used in multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the use of pretrained models and the exploration of critical network design choices, which are topics related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of low-cost convolutions and the trade-off between speed and accuracy, which are topics related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
