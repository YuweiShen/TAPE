The focus is on space complexity, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of distance measures, which could place it in the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) or cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) sub-categories. The use of cross-correlation/convolution algorithms could also suggest the cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-category. Finally, the discussion of non-binary inputs could place the paper in the cs.CG (Computational Geometry) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
