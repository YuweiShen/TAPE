Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of various state-of-the-art CNN architectures and proposes a new CNN architecture for memory-efficient classification, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of a large dataset and the need for accurate and timely detection, which could be relevant to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper discusses the potential use of the proposed CNN architecture in mobile applications, which could be relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
