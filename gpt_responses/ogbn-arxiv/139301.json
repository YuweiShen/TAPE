This topic falls under information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of neural networks also suggests machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper also involves data mining and analysis of social media streams, which could fall under social and information sciences (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
