This falls under the scope of social and information networks. \n2. cs.SD (Software Engineering) - The paper proposes an iterative state equation and a score function for identifying influential follower links, which can be considered as software engineering techniques for analyzing event propagation on Twitter. \n3. cs.SOC (Computational Social Science) - The paper uses Twitter data to study event propagation and identifies the Network of Networks (NoN) structure embedded in the follower networks, which is a topic of interest in computational social science. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper formulates event propagation on Twitter as an iterative state equation and proposes a score function on follower links, which involves algorithmic techniques for analyzing data structures. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper uses user languages to identify the NoN structure embedded in the Twitter follower networks, which can be considered as an information retrieval task."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
