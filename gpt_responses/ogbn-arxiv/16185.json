The paper proposes a new algorithm for handling problems with a changing number of objectives. This algorithm involves maintaining two co-evolving populations that are complementary to each other and interact with each other via a mating selection mechanism. This paper is likely to be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it deals with evolutionary computation, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it involves optimization, and cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it involves learning from data. It may also be categorized under cs.SY (Systems and Control) as it deals with optimization in dynamic systems and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) as it involves combinatorial optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
