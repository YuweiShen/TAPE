The paper also proposes an iterative reweighted method, which falls under the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The paper addresses the issue of discretization in compressed sensing, which is related to numerical analysis and optimization, and thus could fall under the cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) sub-category.
