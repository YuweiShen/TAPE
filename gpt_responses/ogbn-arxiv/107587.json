This methodology can be seen as a machine learning approach to detecting concept drift and anomaly detection in graph streams.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with stochastic processes generating graphs, which can be seen as a type of network data. The proposed methodology can be applied to various types of attributed graphs, including those representing biological molecules and drawings, which are common in social and information networks.\n- cs.DM (Data Mining): The paper proposes a methodology for detecting changes in stationarity of stochastic processes generating graphs, which can be seen as a type of data mining problem. The methodology involves embedding graphs into a vector domain and applying a multivariate change detection procedure, which are common techniques in data mining.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a methodology for detecting changes in stationarity of stochastic processes generating graphs, which can be seen as a type of artificial intelligence problem.
