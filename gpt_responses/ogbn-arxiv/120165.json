It could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it proposes a new framework for learning discrete codes and composing embedding vectors. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as these fields also use embedding vectors. Finally, it could be categorized under cs.MM (Multimedia) as it deals with compressing embedding vectors."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
