The use of Mobius transformations as a new tool for proving complexity reductions suggests a connection to algebraic complexity theory (cs.DS), while the discovery of previously unknown families of planar-tractable partition functions suggests a connection to computational geometry (cs.CG) or discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The mention of a \"loop space\" also suggests a connection to topology and algebraic topology (cs.IT, cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
