The paper proposes a new method called blind image deblurring using row-column sparsity (BD-RCS) to address the issue of handling large motions. This involves modeling the outer product of kernel and image coefficients in certain transformation domains as a rank-one matrix and recovering it by solving a rank minimization problem. The paper also proposes two new optimization problems involving RCS to automatically determine blur kernel and image support sequentially. These techniques involve concepts from computer vision, image processing, optimization, and signal processing, which are all subfields of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.SI (Signal Processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
