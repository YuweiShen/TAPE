The use of self-supervised learning and regularization techniques also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the evaluation of the methods on classification and detection tasks suggests a potential connection to natural language processing (cs.CL), although this is less likely than the other categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
