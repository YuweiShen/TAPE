The paper discusses the step-decay schedule, which is a popular learning rate schedule used in practice. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also mentions training modern deep neural networks, which suggests a possible connection to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper deals with optimization, which could also place it in the sub-category cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
