The use of monomial codes is a specific technique within code-based cryptography, which could fall under the category of coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the problem of finding cliques in a graph, which is a common topic in computer science (cs.CY) and could be relevant to the field of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
