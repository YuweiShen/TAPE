Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also discusses the communication and computation constraints of on-board units, which suggests the category cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper proposes a vehicle-centric solution, which could fall under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper discusses the practicality and scalability of the proposed solution, which could also fall under cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
