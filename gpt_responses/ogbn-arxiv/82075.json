This involves natural language processing techniques and classification models, which fall under the scope of cs.CL.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The dataset is collected from comments on YouTube videos, which are a form of social media. The paper also discusses the challenges of annotating social media data, which is noisy and unstructured. Therefore, cs.SI is a likely sub-category.\n- cs.SD (Sound): This is a less likely sub-category, but it is possible that the YouTube videos contain audio content that is relevant to the study of misogyny and aggression.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper addresses issues related to gender-based violence and hate speech on social media, which are important societal concerns. Therefore, cs.CY is a possible sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the development of a classifier for misogyny in the three languages, which involves machine learning techniques. Therefore, cs.LG is a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
