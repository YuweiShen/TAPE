It also involves deep neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. The paper also mentions factorization schemes, which are often used in machine learning (cs.LG) to reduce the dimensionality of features. Additionally, the paper focuses on image retrieval (cs.IR) and mentions state-of-the-art results on three image retrieval datasets. The use of high order statistics and codebook strategy also suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
