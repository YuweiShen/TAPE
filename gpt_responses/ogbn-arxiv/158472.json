The use of training symbols to estimate channel fading coefficients falls under the Signal Processing (cs.SY) sub-category. The investigation of energy efficiency and resource allocation strategies is relevant to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Finally, the analysis of bit energy requirements and comparisons with noncoherent transmission schemes could fall under the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
