This requires the use of data structures and algorithms to efficiently maintain the matching and update it as new jobs arrive. \n2. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The problem of online bipartite matching can be viewed as a game between the algorithm and the adversary, where the algorithm tries to maximize the expected sum of utilities while the adversary tries to minimize it. This makes the problem relevant to game theory. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The problem of online bipartite matching involves making decisions based on incomplete information (i.e., the distribution over job types), which is a common theme in machine learning. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The problem of online bipartite matching involves making decisions in an uncertain and dynamic environment, which is a key challenge in artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory): The problem of online bipartite matching involves maximizing the expected sum of utilities, which can be viewed as a communication problem between the algorithm and the adversary. This makes the problem relevant to information theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
