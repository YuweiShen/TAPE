The paper discusses the use of text embeddings for document retrieval, which is a common task in information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP). Therefore, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of deep neural models, which falls under the categories of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning (DL), making cs.AI and cs.DL likely sub-categories as well. Finally, the paper discusses the empirical comparison of various text-embedding methods, which is a common task in machine learning (ML) and statistics, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
