It may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as cellular games are often used in AI research. The Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper models the behavior of a chain of economic agents. The Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category is relevant as cellular games can be seen as a type of network. Finally, the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DS) sub-category may be relevant as cellular games can be implemented in a distributed or parallel computing environment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
