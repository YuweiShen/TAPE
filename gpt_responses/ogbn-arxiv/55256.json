The approach involves mapping the structure onto a generic form called serialization, which can be used with any sequence-based density estimator. This suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), or neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
