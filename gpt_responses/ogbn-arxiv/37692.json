This involves optimization algorithms and QoE metrics, which are typically studied in the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with bandwidth prediction and optimization, which are also relevant to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses fairness and performance of the proposed algorithm, which are topics of interest in the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
