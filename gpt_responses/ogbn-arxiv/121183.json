It also discusses the performance of coding schemes in terms of signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR), which is a metric commonly used in multimedia applications (cs.MM). The paper also considers the asymptotic performance of coding schemes, which is a topic in statistical inference (cs.ST) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the use of hybrid digital-analog (HDA) coding schemes, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI) and communication networks (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
