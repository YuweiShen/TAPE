These are concepts related to information theory.\n2. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) - The paper also discusses hardware architectures for implementing the proposed scheme, which falls under the domain of hardware architecture.\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a new decoding algorithm for polar codes, which involves the use of a 2-bit quantized hard-decision decoder. This falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the need for a suitable error correction code to ensure data integrity and accuracy in MLC NAND flash memory, which is a system-level concern.\n5. cs.ET (Embedded Systems) - The proposed scheme is intended to be embedded in the control system of MLC NAND flash memory, which falls under the domain of embedded systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
