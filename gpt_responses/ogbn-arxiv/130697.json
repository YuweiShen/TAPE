The use of structured matrices, such as Toeplitz, Hankel, Cauchy, and Vandermonde matrices, is a common technique to reduce the computational cost of these problems. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): This sub-category covers topics related to the numerical solution of mathematical problems, including linear systems of equations and matrix computations.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category covers topics related to the design and analysis of algorithms, which is a key aspect of the paper.\n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation and Computer Algebra): This sub-category covers topics related to the manipulation of mathematical expressions and algorithms, which is relevant to the polynomial and rational functions involved in the paper.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): This sub-category covers topics related to the modeling, analysis, and control of dynamical systems, which is relevant to the linear systems of equations studied in the paper.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): This sub-category covers topics related to the study of the intrinsic difficulty of computational problems, which is a key aspect of the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
