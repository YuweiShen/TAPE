This involves the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) to detect and match changes in the environment. This falls under the domain of AI. \n2. cs.LG - The paper proposes a learning algorithm that uses reinforcement learning to optimize control in a decentralised system. This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n3. cs.MA - The paper proposes a multi-agent system that uses reinforcement learning to optimize control in a decentralised system. This falls under the domain of multi-agent systems. \n4. cs.SY - The paper proposes a system that deals with dynamic and uncertain environments, which is a characteristic of complex systems. This falls under the domain of systems engineering. \n5. cs.NE - The paper proposes the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to detect and match changes in the environment.
