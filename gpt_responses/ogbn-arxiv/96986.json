The use of a simulation game to study decision-making also suggests a potential focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and social computing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper specifically mentions cybersecurity capability development, which could fall under the sub-category of cybersecurity (cs.CY). Finally, the analysis of simulation runs and comparison of experienced and inexperienced groups suggests a potential focus on game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
