The use of mutual information and recurrent neural networks suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the examination of 106 languages implies a cross-linguistic perspective, which could fall under natural language processing (cs.NE) or computational comparative linguistics (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
