It also involves algebraic structures and constructions, which are relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The study of self-dual codes is closely related to cryptography and security (cs.CR), and the use of invariant theory to describe weight enumerators involves numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
