Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of information transmission and processing. The paper also discusses the distortion bound of the recovered signal, which suggests that it could belong to cs.SP (Signal Processing) as well. The use of prior support and its quality information could also place it in cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the application to massive MIMO systems suggests that it could belong to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
