This makes it likely to belong to the Game Theory (cs.GT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper presents a fast algorithm for computing optimal strategies, which suggests it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of probability distributions in optimal play may also make it relevant to the Data Structures (cs.DS) and Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on bidding and auctions could make it relevant to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
