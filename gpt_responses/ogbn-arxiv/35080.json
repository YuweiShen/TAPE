The dataset includes multiview image streams, which were used to reconstruct high fidelity models of five elementary parts: gaze, face, hands, body, and cloth. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision sub-category.\n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper focuses on collecting human behaviors from a diverse population using a massive multi-camera system. The dataset includes information about gaze, face, hands, body, and cloth, which can be used to study human behavior and interactions. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Human-Computer Interaction sub-category.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper presents a new dataset of high fidelity models of behavioral signals in 3D, which were collected using a portable imaging system consisting of 107 HD cameras. The dataset includes multiview image streams, which were used to reconstruct high fidelity models of five elementary parts: gaze, face, hands, body, and cloth.
