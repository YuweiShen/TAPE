The paper also formulates the problem as a non-cooperative power allocation game, which falls under game theory (cs.GT) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the interdependence of different tasks in spectrum management, which can be seen as a system-level perspective (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of joint decoding at the access point, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
