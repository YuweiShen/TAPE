The paper also introduces a new type of neural network architecture, which involves the use of bounded gradient functions, which could be considered a machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of a weighted loss function to improve recognition rates, which could be considered an artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The experiments conducted in the paper involve the use of publicly available facial databases, which could be considered a multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the practical applications of facial expression recognition, which could be considered a human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
