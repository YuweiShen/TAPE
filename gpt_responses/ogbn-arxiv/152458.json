This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the architecture of C-RANs and the fronthaul links connecting remote radio heads to the central unit. This is a networking and internet architecture problem.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an alternative CU-RRH functional split that enables local detection, which can be seen as a control problem.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper leverages Bayesian sparse detection, which is a machine learning technique.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): Although not the main focus of the paper, the use of C-RANs is often motivated by the need to support multimedia applications with high bandwidth and low latency requirements."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
