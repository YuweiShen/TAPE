This falls under the scope of natural language processing, which is a subfield of CS.CL.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed model for intent detection and slot filling is based on deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in AI research. Additionally, the paper discusses the development of an in-cabin agent for autonomous vehicles, which is an application of AI.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper explores the design of an in-cabin agent that can handle natural language interactions with passengers in autonomous vehicles. This falls under the scope of human-computer interaction, which is a subfield of CS.HC.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed model for intent detection and slot filling is based on deep learning techniques, which are a subset of machine learning. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of a multi-modal dataset for training and testing the model, which is a common practice in machine learning research.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the development of an in-cabin agent for autonomous vehicles, which is an application of robotics.
