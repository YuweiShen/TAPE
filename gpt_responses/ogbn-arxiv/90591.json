The problem involves stable matching, which is a well-studied topic in computer science, and the paper provides a discrete algorithm for constructing the stable-matching Voronoi diagram, which suggests that it could also belong to the algorithms (cs.DS) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
