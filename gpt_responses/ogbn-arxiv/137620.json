This involves the use of information theory (cs.IT) to achieve any rate up to capacity, as well as networked systems (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY) to handle the feedback. The paper also discusses linear processing schemes (cs.MM) and the use of limited rate feedback channels (cs.COM) to convey quantized CSI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
