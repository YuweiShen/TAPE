The paper proposes a new algorithm for handling the positive sparsity problem in detection tasks, which involves optimizing over F-measure via dynamic cost-sensitive learning. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) subcategories. Additionally, the paper mentions experiments involving neural network based detection models, which suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) may also be a relevant subcategory. Finally, the paper deals with instance importance measuring, which is a common problem in information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
