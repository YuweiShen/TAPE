Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also incorporates user tastes, topic tastes, and user comments on posts, which involves social network analysis and information retrieval, making cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also mentions the use of deep learning models, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category.
