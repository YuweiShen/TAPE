The investigation of the minimum number of crossings for different types of crossings involves combinatorial methods (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the algorithmic results and complexity analysis fall under the category of computational complexity and algorithms (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
