The abstract mentions large deviations performance analysis, which is a common topic in information theory and probability theory. Therefore, cs.IT and cs.SI are the most likely categories. The use of random networks suggests cs.NI as another likely category. The mention of on-the-fly computation and simulation examples suggest cs.SY as a possible category. Finally, the use of mathematical analysis to derive theoretical results suggests cs.MA as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
