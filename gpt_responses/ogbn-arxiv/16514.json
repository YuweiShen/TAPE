This is a fundamental problem in information theory and signal processing.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes novel deep learning-based architectures and design methodologies for OFDM receivers. Specifically, it uses a generative supervised deep neural network for channel estimation and an autoencoder for data detection. These are typical topics in neural and evolutionary computing.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses deep learning techniques to solve the problem of one-bit OFDM receivers. This falls under the scope of machine learning.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a new system design for OFDM receivers that uses deep learning techniques. This is relevant to the field of systems and control.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the problem of data detection in OFDM receivers, which is a key component of multimedia communication systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
