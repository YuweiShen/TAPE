The use of recognition APIs and objective quality algorithms also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of multiple devices and environments suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM), and the investigation of recognition performance under challenging conditions suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
