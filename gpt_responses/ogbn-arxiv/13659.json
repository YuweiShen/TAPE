This is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. The use of wavelet coefficients suggests a potential connection to signal processing (cs.IT), while the focus on visual quality assessment could also be relevant to graphics (cs.GR) and machine learning (cs.LG) subfields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
