The fusion-width parameter is related to tree-width and clique-width, which are also topics in computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper discusses the computational complexity of computing the fusion-width, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
