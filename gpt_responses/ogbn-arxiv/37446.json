The paper also uses classical results of extremal set theory, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also discusses related models inspired by secret sharing, which is a topic in distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper investigates adaptive versions of the different models, which is a topic in game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
