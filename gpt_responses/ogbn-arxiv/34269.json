Therefore, cs.CV and cs.HC are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also utilizes synthetic data and proposes a weakly-supervised method, which are related to machine learning (ML) and specifically, weakly-supervised learning. Therefore, cs.LG is also a likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves eye gaze information, which is related to multimedia (MM) and graphics (GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
