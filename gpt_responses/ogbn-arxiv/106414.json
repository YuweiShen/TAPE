The paper also discusses the use of symmetric kernels as a regularizer, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the improvement in generalization of CNNs, which is related to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the approximation of rotational invariance, which is related to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
