The use of channel state information and alternate capacity and distortion metrics suggests a focus on Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the mention of ergodic sources and channels suggests a possible connection to Dynamical Systems (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
