This falls under the category of Information Theory (cs.IT). The paper also models the WOM storage as a state transition graph, which involves the use of data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.DC). The proposed construction includes a labeling method for states using integer programming, which falls under the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Signal Processing (cs.SP). Finally, the paper discusses the reduction of inter-cell interference in flash cells, which falls under the category of Architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
