The focus of the paper is on reducing the computational complexity of the construction process, which involves sorting algorithms and partial orders, making it likely to also fall under the categories of systems and control (cs.SI) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of Tal-Vardy's algorithm, which is a technique used in coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the proposed method involves reducing the dimension of the undetermined bit channels, which could be seen as a machine learning approach (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
