This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) categories. The paper also discusses interference alignment (IA) and zero forcing (ZF) techniques, which are commonly used in signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper derives outer bounds on the GDOF under different assumptions of cooperation, which is related to the field of computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
