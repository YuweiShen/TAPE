The paper specifically focuses on the training process of MLPs, which involves updating parameters, and the assumption of exchangeability. This suggests that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the layer-wise kernel of fully-connected layers, which relates to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the identification of a sharp change in network behavior suggests a connection to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
