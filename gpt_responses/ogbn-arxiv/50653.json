The optimization of transmission ranks and user scheduling is based on maximizing a network utility function accounting for fairness among users. This involves the use of interference mitigation techniques, which are typically studied in the information theory literature. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a distributed coordinated scheduler for the OFDMA downlink network, which is motivated by an interference pricing mechanism and relies on a master-slave architecture. This involves the use of networking and internet architecture concepts. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed coordination scheme involves joint optimization of transmission ranks and user scheduling in all cells to maximize a network utility function. This involves the use of systems and control techniques. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of multiple antennas at the transmitter and the receiver to enable multi-stream transmissions to cell edge users. This involves the use of multimedia techniques. \n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The proposed distributed coordinated scheduler is operated based on the user report of a recommended rank for the interfering cells accounting for the receiver interference suppression capability. This involves the use of distributed computing concepts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
