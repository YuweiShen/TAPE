The paper also discusses the identification of pirates in a multimedia setting, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The results are obtained using probabilistic methods, which are commonly used in coding theory (cs.CC) and information theory. Finally, the paper discusses the number of codewords in separable codes, which is a topic related to computational complexity (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
