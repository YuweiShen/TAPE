The use of pairwise constraints and weak labels suggests a focus on semi-supervised learning, which is often studied in the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of feature embeddings and raw data also suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL), where such techniques are commonly used. The use of neural networks also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
