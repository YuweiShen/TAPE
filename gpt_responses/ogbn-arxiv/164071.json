The use of stochastic transmit beamforming and Alamouti space-time coding also suggests a focus on signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia systems (cs.MM). Finally, the presentation of simulation results indicates a possible focus on computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
