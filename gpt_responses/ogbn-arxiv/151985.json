The paper proposes an algorithm based on the computation of the degree of determinants of symbolic matrices, which involves techniques from algebraic geometry and linear algebra. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), followed by cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The paper also involves some control theory and optimization techniques, which could place it in the sub-categories cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
