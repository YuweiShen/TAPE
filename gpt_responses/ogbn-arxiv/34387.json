The use of deep learning for identifying IoT devices from network traffic suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The focus on network traffic and communication behavior of IoT devices suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the use of small images built from network traffic payloads suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
