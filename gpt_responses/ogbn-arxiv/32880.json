Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new approach to improve the last layers of the network, which involves machine learning (LG) and neural networks (NE). Additionally, the paper mentions exploiting recent advances in fine-grained recognition literature, which is related to multimedia (MM) and artificial intelligence (AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
