The topic of game theory is covered by the cs.GT sub-category, which makes it the most likely category. The paper also deals with optimization and algorithms, which are covered by the cs.DS and cs.IT sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of convex cost functions, which is a topic covered by the cs.NE sub-category.
