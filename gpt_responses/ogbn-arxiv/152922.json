The paper also discusses the performance of the algorithm for non-i.i.d. channel matrices, which could be categorized under statistical learning (cs.LG) or networked systems (cs.NI). The use of regularization techniques in the algorithm could also be relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper specifically mentions the use of box-LASSO, which is a machine learning technique, and could be categorized under the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
