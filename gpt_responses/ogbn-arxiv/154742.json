The system also involves two servers and makes improvements on protocols employed by prior work, which suggests Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) as possible sub-categories. The paper also mentions message throughput, latency, and bandwidth consumption, which are related to Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
