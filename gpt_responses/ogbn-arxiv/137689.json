This technique is shown to be universal and efficient, and is applied to realistic Fourier imaging techniques. The paper therefore falls under the categories of information theory (cs.IT), signal processing (cs.SP), machine learning (cs.LG), multimedia (cs.MM), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
