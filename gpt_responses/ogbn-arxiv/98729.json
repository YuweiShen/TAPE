The experiments involve classification, face verification, and abnormal event detection, which are tasks commonly studied in computer vision and multimedia analysis. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper involves the use of closed-form solutions and optimization techniques, which are also relevant to the sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
