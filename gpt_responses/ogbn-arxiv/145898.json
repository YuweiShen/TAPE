The paper also focuses on linear temporal difference (TD) updates, which are a popular method for updating value functions in reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses practical applications of the algorithms, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
