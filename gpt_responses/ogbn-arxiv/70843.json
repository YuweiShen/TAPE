This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) categories. The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques such as ensemble classifiers and batch normalization, which are relevant to the categories of cryptography and security (cs.CR), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.CV and cs.MM, followed by cs.CR, cs.LG, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
