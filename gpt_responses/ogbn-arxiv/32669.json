The paper specifically focuses on a new algorithmic model called double-sided myopic algorithms, which falls under the category of algorithm design and analysis. Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is the most likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also involves game theory, as it discusses the concept of approximation ratios and the hardness of certain problems. This makes cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) a likely sub-category as well. \n\nInformation theory (cs.IT) is also relevant, as the paper discusses the trade-off between deterministic and randomized algorithms. \n\nMachine learning (cs.LG) may also be a relevant sub-category, as submodular maximization is used in certain machine learning applications. \n\nFinally, the paper involves complexity theory, as it deals with NP-hard problems.
