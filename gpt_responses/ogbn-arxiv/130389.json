The most relevant sub-category is likely cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) since deep learning is widely used in these fields. The paper also discusses the limitations of current calibration metrics, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) since these sub-categories deal with the evaluation and improvement of machine learning models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
