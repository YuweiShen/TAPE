This involves using a generative neural network architecture that maps the input scan to an indexed face set. The paper thus involves computer vision (cs.CV) techniques for processing the range scan, graphics (cs.GR) techniques for generating the mesh, machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) techniques for training the generative model, and neural networks (cs.NE) for the architecture design."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
