The paper also discusses the design of deep neural networks for object classification, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of convolutional neural networks is a key aspect of the paper, which is also relevant to the subfield of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses experiments and results on large-scale datasets, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
