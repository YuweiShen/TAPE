The paper discusses the use of multiple interfaces and the optimal set of distribution trees, which are relevant to network infrastructure (cs.NI) and information theory (cs.IT). The paper also mentions improved resiliency to errors, which is related to cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of network coding and its impact on throughput gains is relevant to distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the experimental evaluation of the proposed protocol's performance gains for content retrieval in various network scenarios is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
