This involves the study of the mean time to complete transmission and the use of acknowledgements to decode the information correctly. These are all topics that fall under the purview of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with broadcasting in a network setting, where nodes cannot transmit and receive information simultaneously. This involves the study of the mean time to complete transmission and the use of acknowledgements to decode the information correctly. These are all topics that fall under the purview of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with the use of random linear network coding for broadcasting in a network setting. This involves the study of the mean time to complete transmission and the use of acknowledgements to decode the information correctly. These are all topics that fall under the purview of social and information networks. \n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper deals with the use of random linear network coding for broadcasting in a network setting.
