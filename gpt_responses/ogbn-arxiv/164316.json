This makes it likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes to extend existing coding methods such as PCA, KSVD and Label Consistent KSVD to Riemannian trajectories or more generally to Riemannian functions, which suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of statistical summaries and vector space representations, which are common in the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the analysis of trajectories, which could also make it relevant to the Software Engineering (cs.SD) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
