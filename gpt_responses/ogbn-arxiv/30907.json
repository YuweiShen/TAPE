This involves building a graph model of input data stratified by prediction error, which suggests a focus on machine learning and data analysis. The specific example used in the paper involves misclassifications of MNIST images with added noise, which suggests a focus on computer vision. Therefore, likely arXiv CS sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
