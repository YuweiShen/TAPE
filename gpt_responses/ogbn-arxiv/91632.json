Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which deals with search engines and information retrieval systems. The paper also mentions the use of deep learning methods, which suggests that it could belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves feature extraction and ensemble methods, which could fall under cs.CV (Computer Vision) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
