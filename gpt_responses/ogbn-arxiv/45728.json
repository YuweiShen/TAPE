This falls under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper specifically focuses on using vision as input and learning from sparse rewards, which further supports the likelihood of these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
