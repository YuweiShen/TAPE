Therefore, cs.CL is the most likely sub-category. The paper also extensively uses deep learning techniques, which are commonly studied in the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, some of the tasks studied in the paper involve computer vision (cs.CV), such as image captioning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
