Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions hyperparameter tuning and neural architecture engineering, which are common topics in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper also discusses reproducibility issues, which could fall under cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
