The use of fixed-point (self-referential) argument also suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and logic (cs.LO). Finally, the paper presents a new construction method, which could be of interest to researchers in the field of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
