This falls under the category of machine learning, which is covered by several sub-categories in arXiv CS. The paper specifically focuses on generating a locally accurate pool for test samples in difficult regions of the feature space, which involves analyzing the classification difficulty of samples in different areas. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
