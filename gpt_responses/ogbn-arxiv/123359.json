This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the use of decentralized control and adaptive control, which are topics related to control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also presents a kinematic and dynamic control law, which falls under the category of mathematical analysis (cs.MA). Finally, the paper discusses the use of a graph to model the coordination among the robots, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
