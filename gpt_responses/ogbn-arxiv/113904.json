This falls under the scope of databases. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an algorithm to classify applications under similar CPU utilization patterns, which involves the use of statistical analysis. This falls under the scope of machine learning. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper mentions the use of text processing applications (WordCount, Distributed Grep, and Terasort) and another application (Exim Mainlog parsing) to evaluate the proposed approach. This falls under the scope of information retrieval. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the tweaking of system parameters to efficiently execute Map-Reduce applications, which falls under the scope of software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
