Specifically, the paper mentions the h-index, which is commonly used in bibliometrics and information retrieval (cs.DL, cs.IR). The paper also discusses the normative element of reinforcing the Matthew effect in science, which is relevant to social informatics (cs.SI) and cybernetics (cs.CY). Finally, the paper uses an example to show the instability of the h{\\alpha} index, which could be of interest to researchers in cryptography (cs.CR) who deal with issues of stability and security."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
