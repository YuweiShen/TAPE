This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses the vulnerability of power grids to cyber attacks and proposes a solution to detect and recover from such attacks. This falls under the scope of cryptography and security.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed algorithm for detecting line failures and recovering voltages after a cyber-physical attack involves leveraging the algebraic properties of AC power flows. This could be considered as an application of artificial intelligence techniques.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the impact of cyber-physical attacks on the power grid and proposes a solution that involves obstructing information from within the area to reach the control center. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The proposed algorithm for detecting line failures and recovering voltages after a cyber-physical attack involves leveraging the algebraic properties of AC power flows.
