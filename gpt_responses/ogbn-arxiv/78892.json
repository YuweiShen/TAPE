The paper also discusses power control and beamforming, which are topics related to signal processing (cs.SI). The paper introduces a novel optimization method called matrix fractional programming (FP), which is a mathematical optimization technique and falls under the category of mathematical optimization (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a new approach for coordinating scheduling in D2D networks, which is related to system design and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
