This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) and Graph Theory (cs.GT) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of probability distributions, which suggests that it may also belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) and Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-categories.
