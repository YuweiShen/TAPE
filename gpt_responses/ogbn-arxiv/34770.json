This is a core topic in information theory, making cs.IT the most likely sub-category.\n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a decentralized architecture for baseband processing in MU-MIMO systems, which involves partitioning the antenna array into clusters and developing algorithms that require low communication bandwidth among the clusters. This is a networking and architecture problem, making cs.NI a likely sub-category.\n\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a novel architecture for MU-MIMO systems that involves partitioning the antenna array into clusters, each associated with independent radio-frequency chains, analog and digital modulation circuitry, and computing hardware. This is a systems and control problem, making cs.SY a likely sub-category.\n\n4. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper proposes a novel architecture for MU-MIMO systems that involves partitioning the antenna array into clusters, each associated with independent radio-frequency chains, analog and digital modulation circuitry, and computing hardware. This is a hardware architecture problem, making cs.AR a likely sub-category.\n\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses algorithms for data detection and beamforming in the context of achieving high spectral efficiency in MU-MIMO wireless systems."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
