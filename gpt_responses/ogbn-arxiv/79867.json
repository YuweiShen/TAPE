The paper also focuses on perception-aware planning, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The use of heuristics and optimization algorithms also falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the use of GPUs for parallelization, which is a common topic in systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
