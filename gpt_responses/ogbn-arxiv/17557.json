This involves studying how to estimate the states of a dynamical system from noisy and maliciously corrupted sensor measurements. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), which deals with the analysis, design, and control of dynamical systems. \n\nThe paper also addresses the challenge of maintaining security of UAVs under cyber attacks, which falls under the sub-category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). \n\nFurthermore, the paper proposes a computationally efficient estimator and combines it with a Kalman Filter for improved practical performance, which involves aspects of cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nFinally, the paper uses simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator, which falls under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
