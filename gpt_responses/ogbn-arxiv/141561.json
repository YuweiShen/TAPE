This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper deals with link adaptation functions in MIMO systems, which is a key concept in information theory. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the use of multi-antenna systems for spatial resource exploitation, which is a common technique in multimedia applications. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper presents a practical MAC implementation dealing with realistic system impairments, which falls under the domain of systems and control. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - Although not a primary focus, the paper mentions the use of optimization criteria, which is a common concept in machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
