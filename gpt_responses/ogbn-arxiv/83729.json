This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of deep learning models and transfer learning also suggests that the paper could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also deals with image datasets and their labeling, which could place it under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses saliency maps to represent spatial information, which could also place it under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
