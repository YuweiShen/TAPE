This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and cryptography and security (cs.CR) categories. The use of deep learning techniques such as R-CNN and Mask R-CNN also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of established classification approaches suggests a potential overlap with information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
