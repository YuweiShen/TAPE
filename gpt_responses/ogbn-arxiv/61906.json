This involves algorithmic frameworks for decision procedures for a wide range of robustness properties in a uniform way. The paper also applies the algorithmic framework to the model checking and the entailment problem for symbolic-heap separation logic. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are as follows:\n\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper introduces a formalism for automatic reasoning about robustness properties of the symbolic heap fragment of separation logic with user-defined inductive predicates. This involves algorithmic frameworks for decision procedures for a wide range of robustness properties in a uniform way. This is related to logic in computer science.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses automated program analysis and verification based on separation logic. This is related to programming languages.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses automated program analysis and verification based on separation logic. This is related to software engineering.\n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper introduces heap automata, a formalism for automatic reasoning about robustness properties of the symbolic heap fragment of separation logic with user-defined inductive predicates.
