The paper also discusses the challenges of training on privacy-sensitive datasets, which suggests that it may also belong to the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper deals with estimating different quantities from the same set of examples, which is a problem that falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also proposes a modular approach to adding privacy, which involves configuring the privacy mechanism, and computing the final privacy guarantees, which suggests that it may also belong to the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of iterative training procedures, which is a topic that falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
