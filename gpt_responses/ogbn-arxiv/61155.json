The comparison between parallel and sequential updating schemes for belief propagation decoding is a topic related to statistical inference (cs.SI) and control systems (cs.SY). The study of convergence rates and error correction performance is also related to machine learning (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
