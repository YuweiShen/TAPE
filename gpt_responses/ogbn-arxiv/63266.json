This falls under the Information Theory (cs.IT) category. Additionally, the paper discusses techniques such as broadcast channel and genie-aided techniques, which are commonly used in Network Information Theory (cs.NI). The paper also deals with fading networks, which is a topic in Signal Processing (cs.SP) and Wireless Communications (cs.WC). The paper also discusses capacity outer bounds, which is a topic in Computational Complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the optimization of the derived bound using the entropy power inequality, which is a topic in Statistical Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
