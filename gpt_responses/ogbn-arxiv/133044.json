Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also proposes a queueing system to model the loss tolerant nature of video streaming applications, which falls under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also discusses the use of Maximum Weight (MW) policies, which is a common optimization technique in cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper proposes a polynomial time implementation of the MW policies, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper discusses the performance evaluation of the proposed policies via simulations, which falls under the category of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
