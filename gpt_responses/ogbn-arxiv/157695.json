The use of models and interpretations also suggests a connection to logic (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a tool called Cryptographic Protocol Shapes Analyzer (CPSA), which involves automated reasoning and could be classified under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
