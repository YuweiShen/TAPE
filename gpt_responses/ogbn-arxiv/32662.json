This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) category. The paper also discusses the use of machine learning algorithms such as SVM, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of previous classifiers to improve the classification accuracy, which falls under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR) and data mining (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
