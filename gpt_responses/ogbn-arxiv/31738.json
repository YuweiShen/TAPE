The use of hashing digest and error correction in communication systems suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of information theory (cs.IT) and cybernetics (cs.CY). The paper also proposes the use of the scheme in classical and single-state systems, which may fall under the sub-categories of software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
