The paper introduces a new model of strong adaptive corruptions and analyzes the security of coin flipping protocols in this model. This makes it likely that the paper belongs to the categories of \"cs.CR\" (Cryptography and Security) and \"cs.IT\" (Information Theory). The paper also uses techniques from game theory and graph theory, which are commonly used in the categories of \"cs.DS\" (Data Structures and Algorithms) and \"cs.DC\" (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Finally, the paper analyzes the communication complexity of the protocols, which is a topic in the category of \"cs.CC\" (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
