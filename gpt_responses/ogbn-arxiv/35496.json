The paper also introduces a new dimension called \"cardinality\" in addition to depth and width, which is a novel contribution to the field of deep neural networks and could potentially fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed architecture on image classification and object detection tasks, which could also be relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) for tasks such as image captioning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
