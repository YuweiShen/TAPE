The paper discusses the standardization of data characterization measures used in meta-learning, which is related to feature engineering and data preprocessing. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
