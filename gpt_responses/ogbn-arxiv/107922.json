The paper focuses on optimization algorithms and machine learning, which are both covered by the Computer Science sub-categories. Specifically, the paper deals with optimization algorithms for machine learning, which falls under the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of a black-box optimization method, which is a common topic in the sub-category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). The paper also mentions the use of search strategies and dynamic stopping criteria, which are topics covered by the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also presents experimental results on benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with the practical selection of hyperparameters for Support Vector Machines, which is a topic covered by the sub-category of Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
