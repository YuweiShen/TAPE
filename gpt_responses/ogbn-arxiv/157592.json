This involves the use of multi-modal interaction frameworks and metric maps, which are commonly used in robotics (cs.RO). The paper also mentions the use of referential expressions and topological navigation plans, which are related to natural language processing (cs.CL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper emphasizes the importance of user input and perception, which are relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
