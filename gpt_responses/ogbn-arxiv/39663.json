Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of training CNNs for edge devices, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a framework for incremental learning, which suggests that it may belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category.
