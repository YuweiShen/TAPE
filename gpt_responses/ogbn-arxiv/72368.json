The paper focuses on the development of a passive beamforming method to improve the average receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and establish a two-step approach at the receiver to retrieve the information from both the transmitter and the LIS. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper proposes a novel passive beamforming and information transfer (PBIT) technique to improve the average receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and establish a two-step approach at the receiver to retrieve the information from both the transmitter and the LIS. This is a fundamental problem in information theory. \n\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a technique to improve the energy and spectrum efficiency of wireless networks using a large intelligent surface (LIS). This is a relevant topic in networking and internet architecture. \n\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a technique to improve the energy and spectrum efficiency of wireless networks using a large intelligent surface (LIS). This is a relevant topic in systems and control. \n\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper proposes a technique to improve the energy and spectrum efficiency of wireless networks using a large intelligent surface (LIS).
