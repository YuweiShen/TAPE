Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The use of neural networks also suggests that the paper could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the mention of using ELMo embeddings and BERT model suggests that the paper could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), which often uses these techniques for natural language processing tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
