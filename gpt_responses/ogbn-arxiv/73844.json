Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SE (Software Engineering). The study also involves interviewing employees and surveying organizations, which suggests a potential fit with cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). The use of mixed methods research design may also suggest a fit with cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.CY (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the study touches on conflicts within organizations, which may suggest a potential fit with cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
