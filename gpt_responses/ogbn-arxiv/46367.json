This involves learning intrinsically generated goal-based tasks and leveraging this experience to quickly achieve high performance on externally specified tasks. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
