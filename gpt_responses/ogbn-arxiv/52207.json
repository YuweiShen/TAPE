Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). \n\nAdditionally, the paper also discusses the potential impact on existing websites if access to certain features is restricted, which falls under the scope of cs.SE (Software Engineering). The paper also proposes a configurable browser extension, which involves programming language concepts and implementation, making cs.PL (Programming Languages) another likely sub-category. \n\nFurthermore, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed extension in terms of its impact on user experience, which falls under the scope of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
