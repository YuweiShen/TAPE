The proposed strategy is based on stereo vision inputs, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV) and potentially machine learning algorithms (cs.AI, cs.LG). The strategy also deals with motion constraints and limited field-of-view, which are common challenges in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
