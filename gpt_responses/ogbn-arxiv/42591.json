The use of hierarchical object representation algorithms and the extraction of statistical and geometric features suggest that this paper belongs to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of optimization algorithms and the joint approach to pose estimation and categorization suggest that this paper also belongs to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The focus on multi-view object pose estimation suggests that this paper may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of image datasets suggests that this paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
