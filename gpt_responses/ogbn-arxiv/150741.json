The paper discusses the limitations of traditional dynamical system models, including RNNs, and how MTDSs can overcome these limitations. The paper also discusses the use of a latent code to customize the generated sequences, which is a common topic in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of MTDSs for natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV), which are common applications of sequence generation and prediction. Finally, the paper discusses the use of MTDSs for improving long-term performance, which is a common topic in neural networks and computational neuroscience (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
