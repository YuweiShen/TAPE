The paper focuses on improving the simulation using system identification, developing an accurate actuator model and simulating latency, and learning robust controllers by randomizing the physical environments, adding perturbations, and designing a compact observation space. The paper also evaluates the system on two agile locomotion gaits: trotting and galloping. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
