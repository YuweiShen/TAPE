This involves learning a mapping from inputs to outputs, which falls under the scope of machine learning.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper focuses on modeling inverse dynamics for robot control, specifically using data from a seven degrees of freedom SARCOS robot arm. This falls under the scope of robotics.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for approximating complex non-linear functions using tensor decomposition, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): Although the paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, tensor decomposition is a technique commonly used in computer vision for tasks such as image and video processing.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This category is less likely, but the paper mentions the use of sparse tensor decomposition in relational learning, which can be applied to modeling large knowledge graphs. This falls under the scope of social and information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
