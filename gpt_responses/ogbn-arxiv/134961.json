This involves analyzing the similarity between the two audio and visual modalities and comparing affective cues corresponding to emotion from the two modalities within a video. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.SD (Sound). Additionally, the paper proposes a deep learning network, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and evaluates the model's performance on deepfake detection, which falls under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
