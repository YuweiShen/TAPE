This problem is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). However, given that the paper proposes new RL algorithms and evaluates them empirically, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
