The model is applied to three cases of increasing structural complexity, including philosophical texts, parliamentary debate, and online discussion forums. The paper therefore touches on a range of topics within computer science, including social networks (cs.SI), natural language processing (cs.CL), data mining (cs.SD), cybernetics (cs.CY), and social and information networks (cs.SOC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
