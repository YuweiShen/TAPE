The paper proposes a new achievability scheme for this problem, which involves the use of lattice structure, structured jamming codewords, and lattice alignment. The paper also provides a lower bound on the sum secure rates, which is a key concept in information theory. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper is primarily concerned with the problem of secure communication, which is a core topic in cryptography and security. The paper proposes a new scheme for achieving secure communication in the Gaussian interference channel, which involves the use of structured codes and jamming codewords. The paper also discusses the security properties of the proposed scheme. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with the problem of secure communication in a network setting, specifically the Gaussian interference channel. The paper proposes a new scheme for achieving secure communication in this setting, which involves the use of structured codes and jamming codewords. The paper also discusses the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of achievable rates. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with the problem of secure communication in a network setting, specifically the Gaussian interference channel. The paper proposes a new scheme"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
