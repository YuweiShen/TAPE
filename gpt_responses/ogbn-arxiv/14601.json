The use of discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) is a key aspect of the proposed method, which is a common technique in signal processing (cs.DS) and communication systems (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the decoding process, which is a topic in systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper proposes a hardware implementation for the decoding process, which falls under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
