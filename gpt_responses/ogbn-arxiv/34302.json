The proposed method involves adding a box regression module and a proposal scoring network to improve the accuracy of weakly supervised object detection, which involves training a detector with only image-level annotations. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of pseudo-labels and the PRS algorithm may also indicate relevance to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
