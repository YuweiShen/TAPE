The use of commercial VPNs as vantage points for measurements suggests a focus on network infrastructure (cs.NI). The detection of network interference such as surveillance and malware injection suggests a focus on cyber-physical systems (cs.CY) and system security (cs.SI). Finally, the use of clustering techniques to discover previously unknown block pages suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and data mining (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
