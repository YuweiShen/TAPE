The proposed method uses superpixel segmentation for scene decomposition and alignment of scene contents at the superpixel level. The paper extensively evaluates the proposed method and achieves up to 5 dB reconstruction PSNR advantage over state-of-the-art methods. \n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with video content alignment and compensation for rain removal in a CNN framework. The proposed method restores high-frequency details to the intermediate output for compensation of mis-alignment blur. The paper evaluates the proposed method using visual inspection and achieves much cleaner rain removal, especially for highly dynamic scenes with heavy and opaque rainfall from a fast-moving camera. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a convolutional neural network to restore high-frequency details to the intermediate output for compensation of mis-alignment blur. The proposed method uses two alignment output tensors, i.e., optimal temporal match tensor and sorted spatial-temporal match tensor, as input features for the convolutional neural network. \n4. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper deals with rain removal from outdoor vision-based systems, which is a common problem in computer graphics. The proposed method uses superpixel segmentation for scene decomposition and alignment of scene contents at the superpixel level. \n5. cs.RO (Robot"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
