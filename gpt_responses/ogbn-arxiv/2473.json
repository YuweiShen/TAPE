This falls under the purview of information theory, making cs.IT the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a DNN architecture for signal detection, which involves training the network using backpropagation. This falls under the purview of neural computing, making cs.NE a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for signal detection, which involves training a DNN. This falls under the purview of machine learning, making cs.LG a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper deals with the problem of signal detection in a wireless communication system, which falls under the purview of signal processing. This makes cs.SI a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the problem of detecting signals transmitted over multiple antennas, which can be considered a form of multimedia signal processing. This makes cs.MM a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
