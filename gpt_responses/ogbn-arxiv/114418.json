The use of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and the focus on large-scale problems suggest that the paper is likely to be relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The optimization aspect of the problem and the use of linear programming methods suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the Robotics (cs.RO) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the use of constraint-based methods and the focus on large-scale problems suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
