Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also covers the use of Software-defined networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), which are related to distributed computing and systems, making cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) the second likely category. The paper also discusses the state-of-the-art slicing approaches and future directions, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the gaps and trends towards network slicing realization, which is related to architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
