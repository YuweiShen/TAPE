The paper introduces an intuitionistic modal logic called OM to characterise open bisimilarity, which is a notion of bisimilarity for the pi-calculus that is a congruence. The paper also provides a mechanised proof of soundness for open bisimilarity with respect to the modal logic in Abella. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Other likely sub-categories include cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.LOgic (Logic in Computer Science), cs.SE (Software Engineering), and cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
