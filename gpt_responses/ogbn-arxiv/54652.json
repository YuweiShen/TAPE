The proposed model uses artificial intelligence techniques such as back-propagation supervised learning algorithm, which is a common technique used in machine learning (cs.AI). The model also involves image processing and analysis to detect obstacles and plan a safe path, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of the model in autonomous systems, which falls under control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves the training of the neural network, which falls under the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
