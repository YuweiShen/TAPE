The use of power-law degree distributions and scale-free graph structures is a common theme in network science and graph theory, which suggests categories such as cs.DS (data structures and algorithms) and cs.GT (computational geometry). The problem of finding subgraphs in random graphs is also relevant to the study of complex networks (cs.NE) and social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
