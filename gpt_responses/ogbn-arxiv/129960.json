The paper discusses the use of hexagonal time-frequency lattices and optimization of transmit/receive waveforms for FBMC systems. This falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the impact of synchronization errors and offers a reduction in out-of-band emissions, which relates to network infrastructure (cs.NI) and system engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of FBMC for multi-source transmission, which could relate to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
