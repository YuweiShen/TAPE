This involves using a network model, historical load and generation data, and regression to find a function for each inverter that maps its local historical data to an approximation of its optimal reactive power injection. This approach involves elements of systems engineering (cs.SY), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
