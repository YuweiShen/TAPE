This is a topic that falls under systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper mentions the use of nested lattice codes, which are commonly used in multimedia applications such as video compression. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper proposes a new relaying scheme based on compute-and-forward, which involves solving computational problems at the relay node. This is a topic that falls under computational engineering, finance, and science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
