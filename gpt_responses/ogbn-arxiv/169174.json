The attacks being studied are related to cyber-physical systems (CPS), which could also place this paper under the systems and control (cs.SY) category. The use of optimization techniques and constraints could also potentially place this paper under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) category. Finally, the potential application of these attack strategies to gain insights on vulnerabilities could also place this paper under computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
