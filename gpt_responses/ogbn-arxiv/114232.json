The use of MDS codes and colluding servers indicates a connection to distributed systems (cs.DS) and cryptography (cs.CR). The study of capacity and linear schemes suggests a possible connection to coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the focus on privacy and security may also suggest a connection to security and privacy (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
