The use of multiple-antenna terminals and joint precoding/decoding design also suggests a focus on information theory. \n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the deployment of full-duplex relaying in cooperative networks, which involves networking and communication protocols. The antenna selection problem and power allocation scheme also suggest a focus on networking and internet architecture. \n\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The optimization of end-to-end performance in full-duplex relay systems involves the design and control of system components, such as antennas and signal processing algorithms. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The use of multiple-antenna terminals and joint precoding/decoding design may have applications in multimedia systems, such as video streaming and conferencing. \n\n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): While the paper does not directly address social or ethical issues related to computing, it may have implications for the design and deployment of communication systems in society."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
