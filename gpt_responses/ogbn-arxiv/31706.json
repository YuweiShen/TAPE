The paper focuses on addressing the gradient mismatch problem in BNNs, which is a common issue that affects their performance. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
