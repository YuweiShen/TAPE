It also mentions practical scenarios such as MIMO systems and non-Gaussian interference, which are relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the low complexity construction, encoding, and decoding of polar codes, which is related to computer communications (cs.CC). Finally, the mention of MIMO systems suggests a possible connection to multimedia systems (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
