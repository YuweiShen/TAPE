It also involves deep learning techniques, which makes it likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a new method for open set recognition, which involves detecting unknown categories, making it relevant to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The datasets used in the experiments are related to multimedia (UCF11, UCF50, UCF101, and HMDB51), which makes it relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves training neural networks, which makes it relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
