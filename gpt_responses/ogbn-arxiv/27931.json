The focus is on selecting the best subset of sensors that guarantees a certain estimation performance. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses several functions of the Cram\\'er-Rao bound (CRB) as a performance measure. The CRB is a fundamental concept in information theory that characterizes the minimum achievable variance of an estimator. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper formulates the sensor selection problem as the design of a selection vector, which is a common approach in machine learning for feature selection. \n4. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes relaxed sensor selection solvers that can be efficiently solved in polynomial time. This involves numerical optimization techniques that are commonly used in numerical analysis. \n5. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper also discusses how the proposed algorithm can be easily distributed, which is a key concern in multi-agent systems where agents need to coordinate their actions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
