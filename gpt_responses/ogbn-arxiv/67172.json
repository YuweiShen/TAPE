This involves the study of graph structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with network coding and communication, which are topics related to social and information networks. \n5. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper discusses the construction of specific digraphs with high guessing numbers, which involves the study of graph structures and properties, a topic that falls under the scope of computational geometry."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
