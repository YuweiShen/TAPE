Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely categories. The paper also deals with robotics and autonomous vehicles, which makes cs.RO (Robotics) a likely category.
