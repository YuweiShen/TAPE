The paper also considers the excess distortion probability and the cumulant generating function of codeword lengths, which are topics in probability theory and statistics (cs.ITP). The paper may also be relevant to multimedia systems (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI) due to its focus on compression. Finally, the paper provides an explicit code construction and investigates an asymptotic single-letter characterization, which are topics in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
