The use of convex optimization and sums-of-squares programming suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category. The paper also deals with feedback control, which is a topic in the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. The use of machine learning techniques to evaluate motion plans suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The paper also deals with obstacle avoidance, which is a topic in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with simulation experiments of ground vehicles and quadrotors navigating through cluttered environments, which suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
