The paper specifically addresses the issue of scaling EMO algorithms for problems with many objectives, which is a common problem in the field of machine learning and optimization. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
