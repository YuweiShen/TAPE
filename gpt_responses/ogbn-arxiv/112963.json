Therefore, it is likely to be categorized under cs.LG.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The dataset can be used for information retrieval tasks, such as identifying the language of a document or query. Therefore, it is possible that the paper could be categorized under cs.IR.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves the use of machine learning algorithms to classify text, which falls under the scope of AI.
