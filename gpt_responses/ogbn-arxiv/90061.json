Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes an agent sharing network, which involves self-supervised learning and fusion of views from multiple drones, indicating a possible connection to robotics and control (cs.RO). The use of deep learning techniques for tracking and fusion suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG and cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with video data and proposes evaluation metrics, indicating a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
