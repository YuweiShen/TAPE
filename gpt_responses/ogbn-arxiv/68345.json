The use of Restricted Isometry Constant (RIC) and Basis Pursuit De-Noising (BPDN) indicates that it could be related to Information Theory (cs.IT) and Signal Processing (cs.SP). The paper also mentions error estimates, which could be related to Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Numerical Analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the use of Partially Known Support Information (PKSI) suggests that it could be related to Statistics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
