Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of automatic feature engineering and fast model learning, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of sliding-window detection, which is a common technique in object detection, and could place it in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
