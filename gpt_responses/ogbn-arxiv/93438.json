The paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to solve 1-dimensional scalar conservation laws. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SI (Systems and Control), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
