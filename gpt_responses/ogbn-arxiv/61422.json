The problem also involves game theory (cs.GT) since it models matching markets. The paper proposes an online attenuation framework that uses an algorithm for offline stochastic matching, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The framework also involves optimization and information theory (cs.LG, cs.IT) to achieve a competitive ratio."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
