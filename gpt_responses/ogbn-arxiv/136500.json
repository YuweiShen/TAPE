The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques for automated detection, which falls under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of post-processing techniques such as non-maximum suppression and differencing, which are common in information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
