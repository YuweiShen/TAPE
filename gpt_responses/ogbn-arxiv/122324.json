The paper presents results on the complexity of computing bounded-error rational-values affine automata and the impossibility of computing algebraic-valued affine automata. These results are likely to be of interest to researchers in the areas of computational complexity (cs.CC), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), logic in computer science (cs.LO), formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL), and scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
