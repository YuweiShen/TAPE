The paper focuses on the use of directional antennas and self-backhauling, which are both relevant to the field of networking. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). \n\nThe paper also discusses the rate distribution and spectral efficiency of mmW networks, which are related to information theory. Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is also a likely sub-category. \n\nThe use of directional antennas and resource sharing between access and backhaul links is a key aspect of the paper, which is relevant to the field of multimedia. Therefore, cs.MM (Multimedia) is another possible sub-category. \n\nThe paper also discusses the impact of increasing system bandwidth, which is related to system design and optimization. Therefore, cs.SY (Systems and Control) is another possible sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the use of a tractable model to analyze mmW networks, which is relevant to the field of computer communications. Therefore, cs.COM (Computer Communications and Networks) is another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
