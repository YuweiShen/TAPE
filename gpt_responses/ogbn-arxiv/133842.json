The paper also discusses a learning scheme for constructing optimal spectral descriptors, which suggests that it may be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper demonstrates its approach on a benchmark dataset, which indicates that it may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
