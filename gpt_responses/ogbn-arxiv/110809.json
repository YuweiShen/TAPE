It could also belong to the Coding Theory and Cryptography (cs.CC) sub-category as polar codes are a type of error-correcting code. The paper may also be relevant to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category as polar codes are used in various signal processing applications. Additionally, it could be relevant to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category as polar codes are used in communication systems. Finally, it could be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as polar codes have been used in machine learning applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
