This work involves techniques from artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for improving SAT solving efficiency. It also involves data structures (DS) and algorithms for CDCL SAT solving. The paper presents experimental results and empirical evaluation, which are typical of research in the areas of machine learning (LG) and software engineering (SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
