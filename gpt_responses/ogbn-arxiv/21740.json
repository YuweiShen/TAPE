The use of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and the focus on combinatorial formulas suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) sub-categories. The study of upper bounds on channel capacities may also be relevant to the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) sub-category.
