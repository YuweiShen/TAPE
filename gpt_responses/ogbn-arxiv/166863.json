The paper proposes a new semantics for non-monotonic queries, which is inspired by semantics from the area of deductive databases. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.DB (Database Systems and Applications): This sub-category is the most likely because the paper deals with a core problem in database management systems, namely, relational data exchange. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): This sub-category is also likely because the paper proposes a new semantics for non-monotonic queries, which is inspired by semantics from the area of deductive databases. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category is likely because the paper deals with the problem of answering queries against target data, which is a core problem in artificial intelligence. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category is likely because the paper explores the (data) complexity of evaluating non-monotonic queries under the proposed semantics. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): This sub-category is also likely because the paper explores the (data) complexity of evaluating non-monotonic queries under the proposed semantics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
