Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. The use of deep neural networks for morphological tagging suggests cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as a possible sub-category. The paper also involves the use of word embeddings for text classification, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the use of GloVe, fastText, CBOW, and SkipGram algorithms suggests cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
