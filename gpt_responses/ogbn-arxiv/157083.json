The paper also discusses the impact of frame size on the performance of the schemes, which is related to networked systems (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper introduces a new approach to estimate the frame error rate, which can be considered as a contribution to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
