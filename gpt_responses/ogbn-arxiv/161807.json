The approach uses a Long Short Term Memory based Encoder-Decoder (LSTM-ED) scheme to obtain an unsupervised health index (HI) for the system. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
