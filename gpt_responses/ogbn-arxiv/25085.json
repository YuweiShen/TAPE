This is a core problem in computer vision, and hence, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new framework that involves multiple branches working together to detect action instances. This involves a certain level of intelligence, and hence, cs.AI is also likely.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves training a model to detect action instances, which is a machine learning problem. Hence, cs.LG is also likely.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with action detection in videos, which is a multimedia problem. Hence, cs.MM is also likely.\n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper proposes a new framework for detecting action instances, which could be useful in robotics applications. Hence, cs.RO is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
