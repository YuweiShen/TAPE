It also involves learning a pose estimator using a novel loss function, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) category. The use of Non-Rigid Structure from Motion (NRSfM) also suggests that it could be classified under robotics (cs.RO) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. Finally, the validation on the H3.6M dataset indicates that it could also be classified under multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
