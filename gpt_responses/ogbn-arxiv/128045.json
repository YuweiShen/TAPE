The paper focuses on few-shot learning and presents state-of-the-art results on two few-shot classification benchmarks (Omniglot and Mini-ImageNet) and competitive results in a multi-modal task-distribution regression. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
