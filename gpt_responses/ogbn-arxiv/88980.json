The paper also focuses on document image analysis, which falls under the information retrieval sub-category (cs.IR). The use of deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning sub-category (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with natural language processing tasks such as word spotting, which is associated with the computational linguistics sub-category (cs.CL). Finally, the use of CNNs for word spotting suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence sub-category (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
