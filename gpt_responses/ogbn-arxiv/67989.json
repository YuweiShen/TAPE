The use of tailored mutation operators involves modifying the codebase, which is related to programming languages (cs.PL). The evaluation of the approach is based on the Defects4J dataset, which is a well-known dataset for software debugging (cs.SD). The paper also discusses the effectiveness of mutation analysis, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and cybersecurity (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
