This involves using cardiac cine MR data and a variational autoencoder architecture with a regression loss in the latent space. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Medical Imaging (cs.MED), and Neurons and Cognition (cs.NEURON) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
