Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of binary-input symmetric-output surrogate channels, which is a technique used in network information theory, making cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) a likely sub-category as well. The paper also discusses the joint optimization of LDPC code node degrees and the mapping of coded bits, which is related to system optimization and control, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the use of protographs, which are a type of graphical model used in coding theory and signal processing, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
