This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. \n2. cs.CL - The paper deals with natural language datasets and the challenge of finding useful analogies in them. This is a common problem in computational linguistics. \n3. cs.LG - The paper discusses the use of machine learning techniques to learn structural representations. This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n4. cs.IR - The paper discusses the use of information retrieval methods to find analogies in large datasets. This falls under the domain of information retrieval. \n5. cs.CY - The paper discusses the use of crowdsourcing to extract purpose and mechanism vector representations from product descriptions.
