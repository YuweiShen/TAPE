The paper derives upper and lower bounds for the achievable error rate, which is a key concept in information theory. \n2. cs.SI (Signal Processing) - The paper deals with the problem of modulation and estimation of a random parameter, which is a classic problem in signal processing. The paper proposes a scheme based on quantization and channel coding, which is a common approach in signal processing. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the problem of parameter estimation, which is a common problem in multimedia applications such as image and video processing. The paper proposes a scheme based on quantization and channel coding, which is a common approach in multimedia applications. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper deals with the problem of parameter estimation, which is a common problem in machine learning. The paper proposes a scheme based on quantization and channel coding, which is a common approach in machine learning. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with the problem of communication across a discrete memoryless channel, which is a classic problem in networking and internet architecture.
