Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which deals with NLP and ML techniques for information retrieval. The paper also involves learning a joint representation for job titles and skills, which falls under the category of representation learning, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) the second most likely category. The paper also involves analyzing job postings and resumes, which involves NLP techniques, making cs.CL (Computation and Language) the third most likely category. The paper also involves location-based recommendations, which involves computer vision techniques, making cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) the fourth most likely category.
