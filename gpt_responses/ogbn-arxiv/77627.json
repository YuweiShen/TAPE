The paper proposes a novel approach that uses a deception network to guide domain randomization in a task-specific manner. This approach is applicable to a wide range of tasks, including digit recognition, object classification, object pose estimation, and semantic segmentation. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
