This involves signal processing techniques such as nested arrays, fast Fourier transform, and continuous recovery of Doppler frequencies. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SI (Signal Processing), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also involves image processing techniques, which could fall under cs.CV (Computer Vision), and machine learning techniques, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
