The approach taken involves streaming algorithms and sublinear space, which are topics in data structures (cs.DS) and database systems (cs.DB). The paper also discusses communication complexity and information theory, which are relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
