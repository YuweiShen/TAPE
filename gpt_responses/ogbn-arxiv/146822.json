Therefore, cs.CL and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of dropout as a regularizer, which is a common technique in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) research, suggesting cs.LG and cs.AI as likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper presents empirical results on standard benchmarks, indicating cs.NE as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
