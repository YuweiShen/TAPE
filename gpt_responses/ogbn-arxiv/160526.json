The paper focuses on developing a new RL method for solving linearly-solvable Markov decision processes (L-MDPs) without active exploration, which is a problem commonly encountered in robotics and control systems. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
