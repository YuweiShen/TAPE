The paper also focuses on energy savings, which is a common concern in the field of neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of approximate storage approaches, which is a topic in the field of approximate computing (cs.AR). The paper also addresses the issue of device variability, which is a concern in the field of control systems (cs.SY).
