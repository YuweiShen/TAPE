This falls under the domain of Information Theory (cs.IT) and Networked Systems (cs.NI). The paper also involves the study of interference channels (cs.SI) and the use of Aligned Images bounds (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper deals with the concept of shared messages (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
