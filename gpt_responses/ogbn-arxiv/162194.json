The use of hierarchical abstractions to generate human-understandable reasons for unsolvability suggests a focus on AI planning and reasoning, which is a subfield of AI (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the computational efficacy of the proposed methods, which suggests a focus on robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves user studies, which suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and human-computer interaction (HCI). Finally, the paper deals with classical planning problems, which suggests a focus on programming languages and compilers (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
