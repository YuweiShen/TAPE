It could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as the task of summarization involves retrieving relevant information from multiple documents. Additionally, the use of sentence embeddings and graph-based models suggests that it could also be categorized under cs.LG (Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the use of data-driven methods and neural networks suggests that it could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
