It also introduces a method that uses phrase-syntactic annotations from the Penn Treebank during training only, which is a common approach in computational linguistics. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) because the paper uses a segmental RNN and a multitask objective, which are common techniques in these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
