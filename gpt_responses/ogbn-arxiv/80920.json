The use of vectors and matrices in the automata is related to linear algebra, which is a common tool in computer science and can be found in topics such as data analysis, machine learning, and signal processing (cs.DS, cs.IT). The comparison of different types of automata and their associated language classes involves complexity theory and the study of algorithms (cs.CC). Finally, the use of blind versions of the machines, where only one entry of the vector can be tested for equality to 1 at any time, suggests a connection to logic and automata theory (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
