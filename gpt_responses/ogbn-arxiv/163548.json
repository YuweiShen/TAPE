The paper specifically focuses on energy efficiency, which is a key concern in WSNs, and evaluates the performance of different variants of Distributed Energy-Efficient Clustering (DEEC) protocol. This involves analyzing the stability period, network lifetime, and throughput of the protocols, which falls under the subfields of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Information Theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
