Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also discusses computational efficiency and storage space, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DB (Databases). Additionally, the paper mentions applications in social networks and computational advertising, which could place it in cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SD (Sound and Music Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
