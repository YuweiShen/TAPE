The paper proposes a model and an EM algorithm for estimating the random walk parameters, which significantly simplifies the problem. The paper also proposes a polynomial-time Monte Carlo EM algorithm based on importance sampling and derives conditions that ensure convergence of the algorithm with high probability. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
