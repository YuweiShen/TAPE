The paper also discusses the embedding of the logic of grounded knowledge (GK) into general logic programming (cs.PL), and the use of disjunctive ASP solvers (cs.CL) to compute the extension/expansion semantics of various nonmonotonic logics. Finally, the paper involves computational complexity analysis (cs.DS) of the translation from GK to disjunctive logic programming."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
