The use of Arikan-style transformation and the construction of codes for multiple access channels suggest that the paper may also fall under the categories of coding theory (cs.ET) and error-correcting codes (cs.CC). The use of homomorphism channels and the construction of codes for arbitrary classical-quantum channels suggest that the paper may also fall under the categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and mathematical physics (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
