The use of features extracted from the glottal waveform to classify emotions also involves signal processing and machine learning techniques, which are relevant to sub-categories such as Computation and Language (cs.CL), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper also involves pairwise classification of emotional states, which could be relevant to sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
