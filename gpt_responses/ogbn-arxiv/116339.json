This suggests that the paper could fall under the Software Engineering (cs.SE) category, as it discusses the application of ISO 26262, a functional safety standard, to ML-based systems. Additionally, the paper focuses on the use of ML in autonomous driving, which could fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Robotics (cs.RO) categories. The paper also discusses the success stories of ML applications, which could fall under the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category. Finally, the paper discusses safety-related systems, which could fall under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
