Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also introduces a new search space and uses a differentiable search strategy, which are related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also mentions modeling global pose constraint relationships, which involves modeling the relationships between different parts of the human body, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its method on datasets, which involves data processing and management, making cs.MM (Multimedia) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
