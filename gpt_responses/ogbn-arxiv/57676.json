The use of Hard Example Mining technique for selecting a subset of data is a machine learning approach (cs.LG) commonly used for addressing class imbalance, which is a common problem in medical imaging datasets. The paper also proposes a robust and efficient method for incremental learning, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of publicly available datasets and the evaluation of the proposed approach on a dental caries detection model also suggests the involvement of information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM) subfields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
