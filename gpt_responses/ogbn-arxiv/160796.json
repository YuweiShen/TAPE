This work is closely related to the fields of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and cybersecurity (cs.CR). The proposed method involves incorporating gradients as a constraint, which is a common technique in optimization-based methods in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
