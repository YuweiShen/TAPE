This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The proposed decoder architecture uses a dynamic message storage in the memory and a simple address controller. This involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms for memory management and addressing, which is a key aspect of data structures and algorithms.\n3. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) - The paper discusses the implementation of the proposed decoder architecture on an Altera Stratix FPGA and achieves a high throughput of 2.0 Gb/s. This falls under the scope of hardware architecture.\n4. cs.ET (Embedded Systems) - The implementation of the proposed decoder architecture on an FPGA involves designing an embedded system that can efficiently process LDPC-CCs. This falls under the scope of embedded systems.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The proposed decoder architecture involves designing a system that can efficiently decode LDPC-CCs and achieve a high throughput.
