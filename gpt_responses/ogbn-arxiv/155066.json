The paper discusses different approaches for efficient search, which are relevant to machine learning (ML) and data mining (DB) as well. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IR, followed by cs.CV and cs.LG. cs.DB and cs.MM are also possible sub-categories since they deal with data management and multimedia, respectively, which are relevant to the problem of large-scale retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
