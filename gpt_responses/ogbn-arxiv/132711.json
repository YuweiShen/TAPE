However, the focus on visual processing and smart triggering makes cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) the most likely category. The use of focal-plane processing and low-power FPGA implementation also suggests a potential fit with cs.EM (Embedded Systems) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper's emphasis on power consumption and low-power processing could also place it in cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval), where energy-efficient algorithms and hardware are of increasing importance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
