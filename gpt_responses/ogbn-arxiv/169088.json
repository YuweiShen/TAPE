It could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a new technique for reducing model parameters. Additionally, it could be classified under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it involves the use of deep neural nets. The paper also mentions experiments and results, which could place it under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category.
