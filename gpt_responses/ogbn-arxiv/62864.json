This involves image processing and computer vision techniques, making cs.CV the most likely category.\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper uses a deep learning-based approach for ASL translation, which involves natural language processing techniques. Hence, cs.CL is also a likely category.\n3. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper aims to break the communication barrier between deaf people and the hearing majority, which is a significant human-computer interaction problem. Therefore, cs.HC is another likely category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a deep learning-based approach for ASL translation, making cs.LG a possible category.\n5. cs.SD (Sound): Although the paper does not directly deal with sound, it involves the translation of sign language, which is a visual form of communication. However, cs.SD is the least likely category among the five."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
