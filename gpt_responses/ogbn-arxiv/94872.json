Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of silver-labelled data scraped from Facebook, which involves web scraping and data mining, making cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) likely sub-categories as well. The use of machine learning techniques for training the tagger suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper also touches upon the challenges of processing noisy and informal language, which could fall under cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
