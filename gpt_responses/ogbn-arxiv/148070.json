It uses LDA topic modeling to analyze reading and writing behaviors of individuals, including Charles Darwin and Thomas Jefferson. This suggests that the paper could fit into several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Deep Learning (cs.DL), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), and Computers and Society (cs.CY). However, given the focus on text analysis and topic modeling, cs.IR and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
