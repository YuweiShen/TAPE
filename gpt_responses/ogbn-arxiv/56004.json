The introduction of new concepts such as absdet-pseudo-codewords and perm-pseudo-codewords suggests that the paper may also belong to the categories of discrete structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper may also be relevant to the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) as it discusses the structure of fundamental cones. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the category of machine learning (cs.LG) as linear programming decoding is a common technique in machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
