The use of neural networks also suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The focus on composition and vector representation could also place it in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the use of recurrent neural networks and the potential application to image captioning could also suggest a connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
