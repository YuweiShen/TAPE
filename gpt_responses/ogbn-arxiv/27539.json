The concept of \"Lightning Does not Strike Twice\" is a novel approach to modeling coupled uncertain parameters, which could be of interest to researchers in control systems (cs.SY) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper proposes tractable algorithms for computing optimal control policies, which falls under the category of mathematical optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
