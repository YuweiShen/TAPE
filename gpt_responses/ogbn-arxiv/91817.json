The proposed method uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a novel double focal loss function, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of skip connections in the CNN structure is a common technique in robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision. The paper also introduces a new large-scale vehicle detection dataset, which could be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and data mining (cs.DM) communities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
