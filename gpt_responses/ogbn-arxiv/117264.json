The focus on releasing differentially private answers to Boolean conjunctions suggests that the paper may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-categories. The use of statistical queries and the lower bounds on differentially private algorithms suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), and computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
