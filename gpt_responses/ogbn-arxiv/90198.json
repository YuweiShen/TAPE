The use of explicit substitution and the connection to linear logic proof-nets suggest a possible categorization in programming languages (cs.PL) and category theory (cs.CT). The mention of the Geometry of Interaction, a topic in theoretical computer science, points towards a possible categorization in computer science and game theory (cs.LG). Finally, the use of call-by-value and call-by-name translations suggests a possible categorization in computational logic (cs.CL) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
