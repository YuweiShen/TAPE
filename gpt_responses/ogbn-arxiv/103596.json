The proposed Cyber-Physical Scheduling (CPS) framework leverages both physical and cyber structures of vehicle traffic flows to address the challenges of interference control in inter-vehicle communications. This suggests that the paper could be categorized under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper also proposes a new interference model (gPRK) and leverages mathematical techniques to address the challenges of vehicle mobility, which suggests that it could also be categorized under cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). Finally, the paper also discusses the challenges of ensuring predictable communication reliability in the face of potential cyber attacks, which suggests that it could also be categorized under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
