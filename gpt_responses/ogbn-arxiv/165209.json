The tool also integrates multi-user annotations and computes label uncertainty, which involves machine learning and optimization (cs.LG, cs.AI). The use of virtual reality also suggests a potential application in robotics and automation (cs.RO). Finally, the paper presents results on both indoor and outdoor environments, which could be relevant to graphics and visualization (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
