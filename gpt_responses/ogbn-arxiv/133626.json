The focus is on learning discriminative and powerful representations that are invariant to sensitive attributes. This problem is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), cryptography and security (cs.CR), and natural language processing (cs.CL). However, given that the paper deals with image datasets and proposes a disentanglement approach, cs.CV is a likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
