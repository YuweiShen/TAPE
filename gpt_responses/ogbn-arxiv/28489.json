Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the use of coordinated multipoint (CoMP) technique, which involves the use of multiple antennas and signal processing techniques, which falls under the category of cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the use of simulation results, which falls under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also discusses the use of constraints and optimization techniques, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper discusses the use of backhaul traffic, which falls under the category of cs.COM (Computer Networks and Communications)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
