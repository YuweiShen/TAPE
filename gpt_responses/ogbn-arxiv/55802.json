This is the most likely category for this paper.\n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the performance of the Go program on up to 240 parallel threads, and analyzes the scalability of the program on the Xeon Phi architecture. This category is also relevant to the paper.\n3. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): The paper discusses the architecture of the Xeon Phi co-processor board, and how it affects the performance of the Go program. This category is relevant to the paper, but less likely than the previous two.\n4. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the programming challenges of achieving good performance on the Xeon Phi architecture, and how the scheduling of threads affects performance. This category is also relevant to the paper, but less likely than the previous three.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper presents a case study of a complex application running on a high-performance computing platform, and discusses the performance optimization techniques used to achieve good performance.
