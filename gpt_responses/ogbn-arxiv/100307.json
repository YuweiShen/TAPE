This involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV) and machine learning algorithms (cs.LG) applied to healthcare (cs.HC) data. The Eye-CU system developed in the paper also involves hardware and sensor design (cs.MM). Additionally, the use of constrained least-squares optimization (cc-LS) for pose classification falls under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
