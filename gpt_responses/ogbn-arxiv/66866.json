The paper also proposes a novel data association scheme based on predicted trajectories, which falls under robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The use of deep learning models for both localisation and tracking also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed method on multiple public benchmarks, including both static and dynamic cameras, suggests that it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
