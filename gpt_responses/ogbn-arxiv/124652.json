Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves matrix operations and optimization, which falls under cs.MM (Mathematical Optimization) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) in the decoding process, which is related to cs.SI (Signal Processing) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
