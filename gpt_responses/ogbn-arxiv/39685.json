This falls under the scope of software engineering (cs.SE) and also touches upon topics such as human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and emerging technologies (cs.ET). The focus on societal change and transformation suggests a potential fit with the category of cybernetics (cs.CY), while the workshop and focus group sessions with local actors indicate a potential fit with the category of computer science education (cs.CS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
