It also involves the concept of ergodicity, which is a central topic in dynamical systems (cs.DS). The paper uses Martin-L\u00f6f randomness, which is a concept from algorithmic randomness and computability theory (cs.LG). The proof involves Birkhoff's ergodic theorem, which is a classical result in ergodic theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper deals with the effective dimension of sequences, which is a topic in computational complexity and information theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
