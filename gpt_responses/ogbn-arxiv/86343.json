However, the focus on waveform design, optimization, and detection aspects suggests that the paper is most likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Other relevant sub-categories include Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Machine Learning (cs.LG), as the paper touches upon aspects related to spatial channel precoding, low-complexity IoT networks, and optimization techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
