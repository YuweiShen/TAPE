The paper proposes a method for constructing sparse coresets for SVD on infinite streams, which is a problem in data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). The method involves using techniques from information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA) to maintain the coresets. The paper also emphasizes the interpretability and sparsity of the resulting coresets, which are important topics in social informatics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
