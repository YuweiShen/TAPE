This involves transferring relation-specific meta information to make the model learn the most important knowledge and learn faster. The paper uses embedding-based methods and focuses on relations that only have a few associative triples. Therefore, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) for the use of machine learning techniques, cs.LG (Machine Learning) for the focus on learning, cs.CL (Computation and Language) for the use of natural language processing techniques, cs.DB (Databases) for the use of knowledge graphs, and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) for the focus on link prediction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
