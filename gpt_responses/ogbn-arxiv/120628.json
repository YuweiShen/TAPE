This is a common problem in social and information networks, making cs.SI a likely category.\n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper discusses a fully decentralized algorithm for solving AC optimal power flow, which involves distributed computation across multiple nodes in a power system. This makes cs.DC a likely category.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the use of tensor decomposition in identifying common features across a collection of matrices in power system computation. This is a common problem in systems and control, making cs.SY a likely category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper discusses the use of higher order generalized singular value decomposition technique in capturing common features in genomic signal processing. This is a common problem in machine learning, making cs.LG a likely category.\n5. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) - The paper discusses the use of semidefinite programming approach to solve an AC optimal power flow problem.
