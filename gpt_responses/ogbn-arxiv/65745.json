This involves refining proposals towards actions over a few steps, which suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of regression outputs from previous steps also indicates a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the evaluation of the approach on video datasets suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
