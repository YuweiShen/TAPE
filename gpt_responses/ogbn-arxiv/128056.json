The use of deep learning techniques also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The optimization of data tiling and structure of DCNN for multi-channel data and splicing edge effect suggests that it could also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the use of remote sensing data for land-use mapping suggests that it could belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
