The use of stit semantics and branching discrete-time structures also suggests a connection to modal logic (cs.LO) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Finally, the paper's focus on axiomatic systems and completeness suggests a connection to formal methods and computer science theory (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
