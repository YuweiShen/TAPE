The paper discusses the complexity of these networks with piecewise linear activations, which is a topic that falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper compares deep and shallow network architectures, which is a topic that falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses mathematical tools for analyzing these models, which is a topic that falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
