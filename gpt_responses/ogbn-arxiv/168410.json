The proposed method uses a regression-based approach, which involves learning mappings between facial appearance and shape-increment manifolds, and uses a locally lightweight feature called intimacy definition feature. This suggests that the paper could also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves experiments with challenging datasets, which could also make it relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
