Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also specifically mentions applications in Information Retrieval, which suggests cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as another likely category. The use of wavelet trees and the exploration of their properties and applications may also fall under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Finally, the paper discusses the representation of inverted lists, which is a common topic in cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
