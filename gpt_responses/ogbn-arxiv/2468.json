Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses the behavior of neural networks with ReLU activation, which is a common activation function used in computer vision tasks, suggesting that cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a remedy to activation saturation, which is a common issue in neural network training, indicating that cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the application of binary neural networks in edge computing, which is a topic related to control systems, suggesting that cs.SY (Systems and Control) is a less likely but still possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
