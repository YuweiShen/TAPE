The focus on synaptic weight elements based on Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs) suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of Emerging Technologies (cs.ET). The use of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures and the demonstration on image classification datasets such as MNIST and EMNIST suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) and Applied Robotics (cs.AR). Finally, the discussion of non-idealities in hardware and the proposed off-line, continuously differentiable HW-aware training algorithm suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of Embedded Systems (cs.EM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
