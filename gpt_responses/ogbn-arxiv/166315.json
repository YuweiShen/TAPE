The paper also discusses the impact of the correlation on the capacity, which is relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of multiple antennas is a key aspect of the paper, making it relevant to the sub-category of multiple-input multiple-output (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the implications of the results for the design of communication systems, which falls under the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
