The paper also discusses techniques for distributed stochastic learning, which could fall under the cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-categories. The use of GPUs for acceleration suggests a possible fit with the cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on optimization and model updates could also place it in the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
