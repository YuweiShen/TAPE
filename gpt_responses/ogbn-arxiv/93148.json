This is a key area of research in information theory.\n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) - The paper discusses the performance of the proposed signal code in terms of symbol error rate and noise threshold, which are important metrics in communication systems.\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper introduces a low-complexity decoding algorithm for the proposed signal code, which is relevant to networking and internet architecture.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper deals with the design and analysis of a signal code, which can be viewed as a system. The decoding algorithm also involves control of the system.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a new decoding algorithm for the signal code, which involves data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
