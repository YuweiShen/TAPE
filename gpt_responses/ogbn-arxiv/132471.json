The development of BigExcel, a web-based framework for exploring big data, addresses these challenges. The paper focuses on issues related to data management, query construction, and infrastructure management, which are relevant to the database (cs.DB) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. The framework also emphasizes accessibility and ease of use, which are important considerations in human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and cybersecurity (cs.CY). Finally, the paper applies the framework to social science datasets, which falls under the social and information sciences (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
