The use of symbolic computation package MATHEMATICA suggests that the paper is more focused on the theoretical and algorithmic aspects rather than practical applications. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.SC (Symbolic Computation). The paper also involves the computation of rational and polynomial matrices, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The use of algorithms and implementation in MATHEMATICA suggests that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
