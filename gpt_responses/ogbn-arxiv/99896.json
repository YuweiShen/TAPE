The paper also presents a framework for handling uncertainty without detailed probabilistic information, which involves techniques from machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper uses this framework to justify various known voting heuristics, which is related to the field of mechanism design (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
