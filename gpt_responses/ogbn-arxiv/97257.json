The experiments are conducted on the MNIST dataset, which is a popular dataset in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper proposes a new learning algorithm for deep-RBF networks, which is a type of neural network commonly used in pattern recognition and classification tasks (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the vanishing gradient problem, which is a common issue in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of robustness against adversarial attacks, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
