Therefore, cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses lattice-based problems, which are a topic in cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.IT (Information Theory). The construction of a hash function family also involves topics in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
