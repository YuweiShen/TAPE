The paper also discusses the use of automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols, which is a topic related to system implementation (cs.SI). The paper proposes two algorithms for turbo packet combining, which involves signal processing (cs.MM) and communication systems (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
