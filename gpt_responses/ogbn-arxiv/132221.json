The paper proposes a certified-removal mechanism for linear classifiers, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the theoretical guarantees of the proposed mechanism, which involves cryptography and security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper deals with the practical implementation of the mechanism, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data science (cs.DS), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
