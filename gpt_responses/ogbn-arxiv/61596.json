The paper focuses on maximizing the minimum harvested energy among IoT devices while satisfying their individual QoS requirements. The paper involves the study of RF EH models and presents an equivalent semi-definite relaxation formulation. The paper also derives tight upper and lower bounds on the globally optimal solution that are exploited in obtaining low complexity algorithmic implementations for the targeted joint design. Based on these aspects, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
