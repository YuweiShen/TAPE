The use of attention mechanism and dense block for better feature extraction also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The creation of a dataset in Pascal VOC format annotated with three types of detection targets further supports the computer vision and machine learning focus. The use of Swish to improve accuracy may also suggest a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
