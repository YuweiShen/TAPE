It also focuses on the concept of computational secrecy, which is a key aspect of cryptography (cs.CR). The study of guessing moments and error exponents involves probability theory and statistics, which are relevant to coding theory (cs.CC) and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper establishes a relationship between different types of exponents, which could be of interest to researchers in signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
