The approach involves defining a system model that captures various relevant structural, behavioral, and interaction aspects, which could also be relevant to programming languages (cs.PL) and logic (cs.LO). The paper also mentions the use of tools to make the semantics definition machine-checkable, which could be related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the system model is a general declarative characterization of object systems, which could be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
