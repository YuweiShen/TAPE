The paper also discusses the properties of these codes, which could fall under the sub-category of information theory and probability (cs.ITP). The construction of codes involves mathematical structures and algorithms, which could be classified under computer science and computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also mentions the kissing number, which is a concept in discrete mathematics and combinatorial optimization, falling under the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the uniformity properties of the constructed codes, which could be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
