The use of implication digraphs suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.CC). The problem of determining isomorphism types of 2-MUs also has applications in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and logic (cs.LO). Finally, the use of polytime algorithms suggests a connection to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
