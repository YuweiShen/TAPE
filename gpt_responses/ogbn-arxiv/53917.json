This suggests the use of computer vision techniques such as image and audio processing, which fall under the scope of cs.CV.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with analyzing multimedia content (movies) to detect a specific type of scene (kissing scenes). This falls under the scope of cs.MM, which covers research related to multimedia content analysis, retrieval, and processing.\n- cs.SD (Sound): The paper uses audio features in addition to visual features to detect kissing scenes. This suggests the use of sound processing techniques, which fall under the scope of cs.SD.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper deals with detecting a specific type of scene (kissing scenes) in a database of Hollywood films. This falls under the scope of cs.IR, which covers research related to information retrieval and search engines.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a binary classifier to predict whether a segment contains a kissing scene or not, and aggregates the predictions to identify kissing scenes. This suggests the use of machine learning techniques, which fall under the scope of cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
