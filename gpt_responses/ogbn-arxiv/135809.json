The paper also discusses relevant applications to incremental computation (cs.DS) and observer design pattern (cs.LO), which are subcategories of data structures (cs.DS) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed approach, which is relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
