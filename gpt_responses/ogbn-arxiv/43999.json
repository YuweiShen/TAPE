The use of technology and the need for efficient communication suggest that the paper could also fit into the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) sub-categories. The focus on network communication and the use of bandwidth suggest that the paper could also fit into the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-category.
