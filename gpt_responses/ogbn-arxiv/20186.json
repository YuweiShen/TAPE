This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a fusion strategy to reduce storage and time consumption, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper's use of semantic information and distance algorithms suggests that it could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
