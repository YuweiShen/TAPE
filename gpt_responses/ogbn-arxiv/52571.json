The paper specifically discusses a popular type of active learning that measures the utility of a sample based on a specified goal achieved by the retrained model. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of influence functions, which are commonly used in the fields of computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses empirical studies with both synthetic and real-world datasets, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the field of data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
