The method involves dividing video frames into grids of patches and training a network to solve jigsaw puzzles on these patches. The proposed approach is evaluated on benchmark video action recognition datasets. Given the focus on video recognition and self-supervised learning, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also involves training a network, which suggests machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) as another likely sub-category. The use of video data suggests multimedia (cs.MM) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the use of a novel permutation strategy suggests neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
