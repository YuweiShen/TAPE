This involves using Bayesian Optimization with a kernel function defined over the proposed embedding space. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
