Game theory concepts are used to analyze the proposed mechanisms. \n2. cs.CY (Cryptography and Security) - The paper discusses the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts to implement civic crowdfunding in a secure and transparent manner. The refund bonus schemes proposed also need to ensure security and prevent fraud. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - Similar to cs.CY, the paper deals with security and trust issues in civic crowdfunding, especially with regards to the refund bonus schemes. \n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The use of blockchain and smart contracts involves distributed computing and consensus mechanisms. The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the proposed mechanisms. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - Civic crowdfunding involves social networks and information sharing among the players. The paper analyzes the strategic behavior of the players and the impact of the refund bonus schemes on their contributions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
