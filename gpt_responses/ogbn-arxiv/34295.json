The use of transfer learning and weak supervision also suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed RRPN module involves region proposal, which is a common technique in robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the experimental results involve datasets related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
