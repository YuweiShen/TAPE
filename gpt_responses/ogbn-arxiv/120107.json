The use of sigmoid and noisy-OR networks also suggests a focus on probabilistic modeling and inference (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the size of the network as a factor that makes exact computations infeasible, which could fall under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The use of numerical experiments to illustrate the tightness of the bounds suggests a focus on simulation and modeling (cs.SI). Finally, the mention of likelihoods in the title suggests a focus on information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
