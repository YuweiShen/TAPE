The use of differential equations to analyze the behavior of residual networks and their variants suggests a systems and control theory perspective (cs.SY). The experiments conducted on a real-world image classification task indicate a computer vision (cs.CV) application, while the proposed method for utilizing Bernoulli dropout within the plain residual network architecture suggests an artificial intelligence (cs.AI) approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
