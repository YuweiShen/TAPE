The paper focuses on the distribution of softmax induced by stochastic transformations and proposes a separate lightweight distribution classifier to recognize distinct features in the distributions of softmax outputs of transformed images. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with security and privacy (adversarial attacks), so cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a method to improve existing defenses, which involves training a separate classifier, so cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
