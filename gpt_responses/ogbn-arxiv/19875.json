The use of cryptographic primitives and the formal analysis of the protocol also suggest a potential fit for the categories of cryptography (cs.CY) and software engineering (cs.SE). The methodology proposed for the analysis of security properties could also be relevant to the categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
