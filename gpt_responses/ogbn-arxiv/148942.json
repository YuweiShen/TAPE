The paper also specifically mentions the use of convolutional networks (cs.CV) and compares the performance of the spiking network to deep feedforward networks (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of a biologically plausible learning rule, which is relevant to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural interfaces (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
