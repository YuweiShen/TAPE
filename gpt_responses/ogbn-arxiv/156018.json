The paper also discusses the use of analytical approach to solve the SLAM problem, which involves mathematical modeling and optimization techniques (cs.CV). The paper also performs numerical simulations and experiments on robotic hardware, which involves machine learning and data analysis techniques (cs.LG). The paper also deals with the robustness of the algorithm, which involves control theory and system dynamics (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the motivation of using the algorithm in real hardware experiments, which involves artificial intelligence and robotics (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
