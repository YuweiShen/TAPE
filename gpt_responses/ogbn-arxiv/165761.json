The use of aligned image sets is a technique commonly used in network information theory (NI) and signal processing (SI). The paper also discusses the impact of finite precision channel state information (CSI), which is a topic studied in the communication and networking (CC) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the coherence time of the network, which is a concept studied in the multimedia (MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
