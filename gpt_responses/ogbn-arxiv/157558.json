It also discusses the tradeoff between error probability and power consumption, which is relevant to the design of communication protocols and networks (cs.CC, cs.NI). The decoder architecture and sphere-packing arguments used in the paper are related to coding theory and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses iterative decoding and sparse-graph codes, which are common in the field of distributed computing and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
