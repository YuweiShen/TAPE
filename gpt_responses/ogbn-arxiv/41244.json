This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions joint learning of discriminative regions and optimal mixing weights, which suggests the use of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) techniques. Finally, the experiments involve face datasets, indicating the use of multimedia (cs.MM) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
