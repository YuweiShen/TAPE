This involves topics related to information theory (cs.IT), network infrastructure (cs.NI), signal processing (cs.SI), mathematical analysis (cs.MA), and multimedia (cs.MM). The use of random matrix theory and optimization techniques further supports these categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
