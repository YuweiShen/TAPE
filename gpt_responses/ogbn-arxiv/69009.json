The use of closed-form expressions and analytical analysis suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of statistical inference (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of simulations and numerical analysis suggests that the paper may also be relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
