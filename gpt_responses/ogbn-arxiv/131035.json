Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the use of NOMA in multi-cell networks, which involves network infrastructure and system design, making cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) another likely category. The paper also discusses physical layer security channel models, which falls under the category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of multiple antennas, which falls under the category of cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the use of NOMA in improving user-fairness, which involves system optimization and control, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
