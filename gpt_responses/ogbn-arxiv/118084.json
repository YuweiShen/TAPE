Therefore, this category is the most likely fit for this paper.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): Jolie is a programming language, and this paper discusses the development and continuous improvement of its usability. This fits well within the software engineering category.\n- cs.Distributed: As mentioned earlier, Jolie is a microservices-based programming language, which is a distributed computing architecture. Therefore, this category is also a likely fit.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): This paper discusses the Jolie programming language, its features, and its community. Therefore, this category is also a possible fit.\n- cs.SD (Software Development): This paper discusses the development and continuous improvement of Jolie, which is a software development-related topic. Therefore, this category is also a possible fit."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
