The paper proposes two algorithms for learning in drifting non-stationary MDPs, which involves both exploration and exploitation. This makes it likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and robotics (cs.RO). The paper also involves the use of metrics and budgets to quantify the variation in the reward and state transition distributions, which suggests it could belong to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with the control of dynamic systems, which suggests it could belong to the sub-category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
