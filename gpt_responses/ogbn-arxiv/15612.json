Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are the most likely sub-categories. Additionally, the proposed framework involves machine learning techniques, which suggests cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Learning) as possible sub-categories. Finally, the use of knowledge bases and distant supervision implies a connection to databases, making cs.DB (Databases) another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
