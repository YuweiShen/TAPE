The use of triplet probability constraints for learning a low-dimensional discriminative embedding is a machine learning approach, which could also place the paper under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also mentions experiments on the IJB-A dataset, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM). The use of deep features for robustness to challenges such as age, pose, blur, and clutter could also place the paper under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with face verification, which is a security-related application, and could also place the paper under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
