The use of Gauss periods suggests a connection to number theory and algebraic geometry, which are also relevant to coding theory and cryptography. The mention of secret sharing schemes suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and access control (cs.CC). Finally, the paper's focus on practical applications suggests a connection to systems and networking (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
