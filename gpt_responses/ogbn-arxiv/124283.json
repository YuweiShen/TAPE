The paper also discusses sample complexity and approximation error, which are important concepts in statistical learning theory and optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper uses concepts from high-dimensional statistics and optimization, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
