This involves combining the characteristics of destructive SRAM reads with the error resilience of neural networks in a memory-adaptive training process. The paper also eliminates PVT-related voltage margins using bit-cells from synaptic weights as in-situ canaries to track runtime environmental variation. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AR (Hardware Architecture), cs.ET (Embedded Systems), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
