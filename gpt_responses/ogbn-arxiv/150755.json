Therefore, it is highly likely to belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): Sentiment analysis is also a task related to information retrieval, as it involves analyzing and categorizing large volumes of text data. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a solution based on self-attention neural networks, which is a machine learning technique. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Sentiment analysis is a subfield of artificial intelligence, and the proposed solution is based on a neural network architecture, which is a common technique in AI. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): While less likely, this sub-category could also be relevant as the paper discusses the impact of e-commerce and digital marketing on Vietnamese society and businesses."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
