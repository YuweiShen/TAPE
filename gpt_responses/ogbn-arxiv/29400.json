The paper also presents a new data set for shadow removal algorithms, which could be considered as a graphics (cs.GR) contribution. The use of on-the-fly learning and user inputs for shadow detection could be seen as a machine learning (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) contribution. Finally, the comparison of state-of-the-art shadow removal methods and the development of an online benchmark website could be considered as a machine learning (cs.LG) contribution."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
