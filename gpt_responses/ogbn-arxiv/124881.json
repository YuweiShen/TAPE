The paper also discusses distributed optimization and algorithms for solving the optimization problem, which falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The paper also mentions homogeneous and heterogeneous multi-agent systems, which are topics in the field of optimization and control (cs.OH). The paper uses the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM), which is a popular method in the field of distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper discusses numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which falls under the category of simulation and modeling (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
