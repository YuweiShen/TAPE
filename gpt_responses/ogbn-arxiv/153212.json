The use of difference fields and telescoping techniques suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), cs.SY (Systems and Control), or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The focus on efficiency and algorithmic improvements suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
