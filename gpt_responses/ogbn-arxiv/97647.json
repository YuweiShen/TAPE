This involves modelling the relevance, error rates, and bias of each information source to learn a spatial Gaussian Process classifier. The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on two real-world problems from disaster response. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Computer vision (cs.CV) and information retrieval (cs.IR) are also relevant due to the use of spatial data and image analysis. Finally, social and information networks (cs.SI) could also be a possible sub-category due to the use of crowdsourcing and multiple sources of data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
