This problem can be seen as a coding problem where the remainders are the received symbols and the large number is the message to be decoded. \n2. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes reconstruction algorithms for the robust remaindering problem. This involves designing efficient data structures and algorithms for manipulating the remainders and the moduli. \n3. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) - The paper derives a closed-form formula for the dynamic range and the robustness bound for two-modular systems. This involves numerical analysis and optimization techniques. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper mentions the application of the robust remaindering problem in wireless sensor networks. This involves designing efficient algorithms for distributed computation and communication. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a method for robustly reconstructing a large number from its erroneous remainders. This can be seen as a control problem where the remainders are the measurements and the large number is the state to be estimated."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
