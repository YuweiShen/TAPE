Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which focuses on NLP and MT. The paper also mentions the use of heuristics and semantic text structure analysis, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the improvement in MT system score, which falls under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR) and deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
