The paper proposes a new training procedure for these models that focuses on the final loss metric evaluated on the output of beam search, which is a technique commonly used in natural language processing. This suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions experiments on Named Entity Recognition and CCG Supertagging, which are tasks that involve analyzing text and could be relevant to Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
