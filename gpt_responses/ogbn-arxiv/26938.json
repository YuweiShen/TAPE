The paper also discusses the covering radius and deep holes, which are concepts that are relevant to coding theory (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also uses algebraic techniques to study the properties of Gabidulin codes, which is a common approach in the algebraic coding theory (cs.DS) community. Finally, the paper discusses the error distance of words to Gabidulin codes, which is a topic that is relevant to the signal processing (cs.SI) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
