The use of LIDAR data also supports this category.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper proposes a method to capture the spatial uncertainty of moving objects, which is a common problem in computer vision. The use of LIDAR data also supports this category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a method to incorporate temporal dependencies into occupancy models, which is a common problem in machine learning. The use of a rich high-dimensional feature space also supports this category.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method to predict future occupancy levels, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence.
