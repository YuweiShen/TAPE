The paper also discusses an extension of first-order logic, which is a topic that falls under the scope of logic. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). \n\nThe paper also presents a trichotomy theorem on classes of existential positive queries, which involves the study of algorithms and their complexity. This makes cs.CC (Computational Complexity) another likely sub-category. \n\nFurthermore, the paper deals with the counting problem on finite structures, which is a topic that falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms. This makes cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) another likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also discusses an extension of first-order logic that can be used to express algorithms for the counting problem.
