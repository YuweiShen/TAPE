The paper also discusses robustness and regularization, which are important topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper uses mathematical proofs and theorems, indicating that it may also be relevant to the sub-categories of neural networks (cs.NE) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
