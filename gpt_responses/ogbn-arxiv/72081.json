Therefore, it is likely to belong to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): This sub-category deals with the study of logic and its applications in computer science. The paper presents a new logic that subsumes two existing logics, and defines a total heap semantics for it, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in this area.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): This sub-category deals with the design, implementation, and analysis of programming languages. The paper is concerned with two logics that are used for specifying programs, and defines a semantics for them, which is likely to be of interest to researchers in this area.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): This sub-category deals with the study of software design, development, and maintenance. The paper is concerned with logics that are used for specifying programs, which is relevant to software engineering.\n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): This sub-category deals with the study of formal languages and automata, and their applications in computer science.
