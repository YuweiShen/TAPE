The concept of sparsity is central to the paper, as the authors show that stable identifiability is possible if the total support area of the operator's spreading function satisfies certain conditions. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Signal Processing (cs.SP), Numerical Analysis (cs.NA), and Systems and Control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
