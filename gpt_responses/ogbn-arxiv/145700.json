The paper also considers achievable rate regions for both discrete memoryless channels and Gaussian channels with additive interference, which falls under the sub-category of network information theory (cs.NI). The use of CSI in the MAC also relates to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper investigates two different scenarios: a two-user MAC with common message (MACCM) and a two-user MAC with conferencing encoders (MACCE), which could be classified under multimedia (cs.MM) and computer communication networks (cs.CC), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
