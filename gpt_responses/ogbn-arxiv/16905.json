However, it also mentions computer vision (cs.CV) and data structures (cs.DS) in the abstract, which suggests that it may have applications in those areas as well. Additionally, the library's high performance and flexibility may make it relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the mention of a consistent API suggests that software engineering (cs.SE) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
