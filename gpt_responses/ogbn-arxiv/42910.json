The use of code expurgation and stochastic likelihood decoder also suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-categories of Information Theory and Probability (cs.ITP) and Signal Processing (cs.SI). The asymmetric nature of the broadcast channel may also make it relevant to the Networked and Distributed Systems (cs.NI) sub-category. Finally, the use of machine learning-based techniques for decoding may also make it relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
