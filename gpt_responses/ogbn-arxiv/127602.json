The paper also discusses the partitioning of messages into two classes, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI) and network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents a system of equations to determine optimal thresholds, which is related to optimization (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
