The method involves learning an embedding space and updating subspaces within a deep neural network, which suggests the involvement of computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The paper also mentions scalability issues, which could be addressed using techniques from neural networks (cs.NE) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
