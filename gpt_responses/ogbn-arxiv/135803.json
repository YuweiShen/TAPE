The paper also discusses algorithms for selecting which model to probe next, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The problem formulation involves a fixed budget of probes, which suggests a focus on resource allocation and optimization, placing the paper in the subfield of data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the empirical performance of various algorithms, which suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
