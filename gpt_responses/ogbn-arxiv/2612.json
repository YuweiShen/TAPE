The paper also mentions kinematically feasible paths, which is a common term in robotics. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper uses a deep neural network for surface segmentation, which is a common task in computer vision. The paper also mentions sparse visual measurements, which is another common term in computer vision. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel uncertainty-aware planner, which involves reasoning about various uncertainties. This is a common problem in AI. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses a deep Bayesian neural network for surface segmentation, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a planner for unstructured environments, which involves control of a system (e.g. a robot) in a complex environment. This is a common problem in systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
