The discussion on how quantum cognitive models can contribute to the modelling and prediction of human paradoxical decisions also suggests a potential connection to quantum computing (cs.QU). However, since the paper does not explicitly mention quantum computing, it is less likely to be the primary sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
