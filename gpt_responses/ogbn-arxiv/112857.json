The paper also uses techniques from combinatorics and number theory. \n2. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the complexity of submodular function minimization under certain constraints, and introduces a new approach to solve the problem efficiently. \n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses techniques from number theory to establish a connection between the correctness of a natural algorithm and the inexistence of certain set systems. \n4. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper mentions the odd-cut problem, which is a classical problem in computational geometry. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new algorithmic approach to solve submodular function minimization under certain constraints."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
