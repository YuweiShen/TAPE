The proposed method involves excavating the intrinsic structure features of different places that are condition-invariant. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The method also involves using a self-supervised cycle loss designed based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper employs a weakly-supervised strategy to utilize unpaired set-based training data, which suggests that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The problem of long-term place recognition is also relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and neural networks (cs.NE), which suggests that these sub-categories are also likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
