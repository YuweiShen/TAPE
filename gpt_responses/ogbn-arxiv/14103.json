It also discusses the implementation of the proposed method using Prolog abstract machines, which falls under software engineering (cs.SE). The paper presents a new resolution method, which involves the use of tables to resolve infinite loops, making it likely to be classified under databases (cs.DS) as well. Finally, the paper deals with the termination and completeness of the proposed method, which is a topic in mathematical logic (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
