It involves the use of graphs constructed from data sets, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), and social and information networks (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper deals with label noise, which is a common issue in semi-supervised learning, indicating that it could also belong to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
