This is a problem that is commonly studied in the natural language processing (NLP) community, which falls under the cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-category. The paper also proposes a transfer mechanism for label dependencies, which is a common technique in transfer learning, falling under the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The paper also uses contextual embeddings, which is a popular technique in NLP and falls under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. The paper also uses pair-wise embedding, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision, falling under the cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on slot tagging and named entity recognition, which are common tasks in NLP and fall under the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
