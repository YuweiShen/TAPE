The paper also introduces a new class of DCNNs called $\\Pi$-Nets, which are polynomial neural networks, indicating that it could also belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of $\\Pi$-Nets in generative models, such as StyleGAN, which suggests that it could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of $\\Pi$-Nets in a variety of tasks, including images, graphs, and audio, indicating that it could also belong to the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
