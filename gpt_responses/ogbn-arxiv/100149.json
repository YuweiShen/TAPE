The focus of the paper is on solving this problem for metric spaces where the query points are constrained to lie on a subspace of low doubling dimension, while the data is high-dimensional. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including:\n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of efficient algorithms and data structures for solving computational problems. The Approximate Nearest Neighbor problem is a classic problem in this area, and the paper's focus on efficient solutions suggests that it could belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category deals with the analysis and interpretation of visual data, including images and videos. The Approximate Nearest Neighbor problem is a common problem in computer vision, and the paper's focus on solving it efficiently suggests that it could belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of algorithms that can learn from data. The Approximate Nearest Neighbor problem is a common problem in machine learning, and the paper's focus on solving it efficiently suggests that it could belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.IT ("}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
