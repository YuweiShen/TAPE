This falls under the scope of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also involves the design of beamforming algorithms, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of multiple antennas and multiple IRSs, which could potentially involve natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques for efficient communication between the different components."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
