The use of coded transmissions between storage nodes suggests that the paper may also be relevant to Information Theory (cs.IT). The concept of data skew and the need for uniform distribution of data among storage nodes relates to Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The rebalancing schemes and communication costs are also relevant to Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper specifically deals with distributed databases, which falls under the sub-category of Databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
