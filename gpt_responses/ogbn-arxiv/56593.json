The use of selectivity and its hierarchy also suggests a connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The study of the internal structure and properties of the selectivity hierarchy may also fall under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper mentions lower bounds and the extended low hierarchy, which are topics in cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper discusses the relationship between the generalized selectivity classes and Ogihara's P-mc classes, which may involve information theory and fall under cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
