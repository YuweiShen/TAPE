The use of neural networks for classification also falls under machine learning (cs.LG). The paper discusses the robustness of the classification for different impressions of the same fingerprint, which is related to the field of biometrics (cs.CR). The study also involves image processing and feature extraction, which are topics in information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
