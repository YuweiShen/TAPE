The paper also focuses on the architecture and network design of the agents, which is a common topic in Machine Learning (cs.LG). The use of 3D environments and simulations suggests a possible connection to Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses the use of limited hardware resources, which is a common topic in Neural Networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
