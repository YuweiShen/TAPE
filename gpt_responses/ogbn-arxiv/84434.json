This falls under the domain of machine learning, specifically in the areas of supervised and unsupervised learning. The paper also mentions the use of ancillary data, which could fall under computer vision or data science. Therefore, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
