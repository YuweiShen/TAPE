This involves optimization of GEMM operations and is relevant to numerical linear algebra and scientific computing. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.MS (Mathematical Software). Other possible sub-categories include cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.SC (Scientific Computing), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
