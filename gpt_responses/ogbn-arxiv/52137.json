The paper also proposes a non-iterative scheme for uplink channel estimation and a hybrid system that combines time-multiplexed and superimposed pilots, which are related to system design and control (cs.SY) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of interference on the system performance, which is relevant to communication and networking (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
