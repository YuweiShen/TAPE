The paper focuses on the application of the Laplacian of similarity graphs obtained from the representation of training data at each layer of the DNN architecture. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper deals with the robustness of DNNs, it could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
