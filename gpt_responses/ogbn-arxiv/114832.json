The use of symbolic computations and pattern matching suggests that the paper may belong to cs.MS (Mathematical Software) or cs.SC (Symbolic Computation). The focus on decomposing the target problem into simpler sub-problems suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). Finally, the emphasis on correctness proofs suggests that the paper may belong to cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
