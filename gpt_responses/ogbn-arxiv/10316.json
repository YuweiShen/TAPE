The method involves capturing complex correlations among data samples using a graph structure and a dual-encoder. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and cryptography and security (cs.CR) as anomaly detection is a common problem in these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
