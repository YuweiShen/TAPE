This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Game Theory (cs.GT) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of prospect theory models for decision making suggests that the paper could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the analysis of the effects of weight functions on optimal communication strategies suggests that the paper could also belong to the Signal Processing (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
