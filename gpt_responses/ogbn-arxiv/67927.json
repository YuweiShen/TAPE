The use of measures such as Inf, Sup, LimInf, LimSup, and WMP suggests a connection to mathematical logic (cs.LO) and the study of quantitative systems (cs.DS). The mention of Boolean combinations of constraints and the study of parameterized complexity suggest a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and the synthesis of reactive systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
