The approach involves formulating the problem as a spatio-temporal graph prediction problem and using spatial graph convolution to build a multi-view graph convolutional network. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
