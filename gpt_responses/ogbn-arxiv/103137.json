The paper proposes a new method to address the issues of noisy pseudo labels and data distribution mismatch. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and multimedia (cs.MM). Among these, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely categories as the paper deals with classification tasks and proposes a new method for multi-task learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
