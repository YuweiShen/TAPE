The paper also proposes a novel framework for cross-domain weakly supervised object detection, which involves domain adaptation techniques, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of image-level annotations, which is a common topic in multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the paper discusses the use of natural language processing techniques for generating image annotations, which is relevant to computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
