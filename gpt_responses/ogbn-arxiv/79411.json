It also discusses privacy implications, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of deep learning in face recognition systems makes it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the large-scale face identification experiment involves handling and processing of images, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
