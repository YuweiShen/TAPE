The use of probe functions and semantic understanding of shapes suggests a focus on machine learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI). The segmentation and keypoint selection applications also suggest a possible connection to natural language processing (CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
