The paper uses techniques from coding theory, probability theory, and Fourier analysis, which are typically studied in subfields such as complexity theory (cs.CC), cryptography (cs.CR), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
