The proposed method involves designing a multi-branch network, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses incorporating skip-layer connections and dilated convolution, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO) for improving feature extraction and object detection. Finally, the experiments are conducted on pedestrian datasets and COCO benchmark, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
