The study of asymptotic behavior of differential entropy is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The concept of weighted differential entropy is also relevant to information theory and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the application of Rao-Cram\\'er, Bhattacharyya and Kullback inequalities is related to statistics (cs.ST)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
