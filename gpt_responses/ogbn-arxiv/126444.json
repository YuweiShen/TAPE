The paper discusses undecidability results for several problems, including determinizability, complementation, minimization, and shuffling of timed automata. These topics are closely related to the areas of logic (cs.LO), formal languages (cs.FL), programming languages (cs.PL), data structures (cs.DS), and computational complexity (cs.CC). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
