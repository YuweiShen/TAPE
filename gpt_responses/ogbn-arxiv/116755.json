This could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. \n\nFinally, the paper uses a bi-directional propagation technique to obtain true 2D global contexts, which could fall under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
