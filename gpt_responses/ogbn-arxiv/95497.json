The paper discusses the design of consistent algorithms for this problem, which is a topic of interest in the field of machine learning. The paper also discusses the use of different surrogates for this problem, which is a common technique used in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
