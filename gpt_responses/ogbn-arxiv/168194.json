This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also addresses power control variables and system constraints, which are relevant to control and systems engineering (cs.SY). Additionally, the use of spatial multiplexing components (SMCs) and grouping algorithms suggests a focus on multimedia systems (cs.MM) and communication networks (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
