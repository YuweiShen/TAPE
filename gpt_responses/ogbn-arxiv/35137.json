The system is trained with a new version of the backpropagation algorithm adapted to on-chip learning in neuromorphic hardware. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper presents a spiking neural network for inference of relations, which is trained with a new version of the backpropagation algorithm adapted to on-chip learning in neuromorphic hardware. Therefore, it is likely to belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper presents a machine learning approach for training a spiking neural network with on-chip learning capabilities. Therefore, it is likely to belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper demonstrates the strength of the approach on a visual XOR task on the MNIST dataset. Therefore, it is likely to belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper presents a spiking neural network for inference of relations, which is interesting for sensor fusion applications and embedded learning in autonomous neuromorphic agents.
