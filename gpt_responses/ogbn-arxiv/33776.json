This involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques and privacy-preserving methods, which are commonly studied in the cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the trade-off between privacy and data utility, which is a topic of interest in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category.
