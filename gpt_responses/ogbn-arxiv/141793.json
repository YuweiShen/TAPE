The paper also discusses the use of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) for traffic shaping, which falls under the category of computer networks and communications (cs.NI). The method proposed in the paper involves analyzing video quality representation, which is related to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper presents experimental results, which involve data analysis and machine learning, falling under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
