Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of ensemble learning and explores the effectiveness of different convolution and ReLU ratios, which are topics that fall under the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Computation and Language (cs.CL) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
