This topic falls under the field of information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SP). The use of orthogonal polynomials suggests a connection to numerical analysis (cs.NA), while the optimization problem and the use of filters suggest a connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
