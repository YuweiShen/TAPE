The evaluation is done on a dataset of images, which is a common practice in computer vision research. \n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract words from images and color them according to the probability of belonging to a textual category of interest. This is a common technique used in information retrieval to extract relevant information from text. \n3. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper proposes a novel visual representation of the semantic meaning of text, referred to as text-map, which is integrated with the actual image to provide a much richer input to the network. This is a common area of research in computational linguistics, where researchers try to combine text and visual information to improve natural language processing tasks. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new technique that combines appearance and text in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting regions of different textual categories. This is a common area of research in machine learning, where researchers try to improve the performance of deep learning models by incorporating different types of data. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper proposes a new technique that combines appearance and text in"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
