The proposed approach is based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), which is a classical technique in statistics and machine learning. The paper focuses on the case of heteroscedasticity, which means that the variance of the data is not constant across classes. This is a common situation in real-world datasets, and it can affect the performance of LDA. Therefore, the paper proposes a new linear classifier, called Gaussian Linear Discriminant (GLD), that directly minimizes the Bayes error for binary classification under heteroscedasticity. The paper also proposes a local neighbourhood search (LNS) algorithm to handle non-normal distributions. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach is performed on twelve datasets from different application areas, including handwriting recognition, medical diagnosis, and remote sensing. The results show that the GLD outperforms existing LDA approaches and other linear classifiers in terms of classification accuracy and training time. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new linear classifier for binary classification, which is a core problem in machine learning.
