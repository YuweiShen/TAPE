The paper proposes an efficient algorithm for the computation of the exact Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) for a generic case. EHVI is a criterion used in multi-objective Bayesian Global Optimization (MOBGO), which is a subfield of optimization algorithms commonly used in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
