The proposed method involves message passing among features, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.LG). The use of gated functions to control message transmission is also a common technique in neural networks (cs.AI, cs.NE). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on three object detection datasets, which is a common evaluation method in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
