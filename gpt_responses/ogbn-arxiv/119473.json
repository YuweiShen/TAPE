The paper discusses the use of RN to refine the encoding representations of the source, which is a common problem in NMT. The paper also discusses the use of attention modules and decoders to improve the performance of NMT. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
