This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a formal programming model for serverless computing, which combines ideas from both the $\\lambda$-calculus (for functions) and the $\\pi$-calculus (for communication). This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The paper also discusses limitations of current vendor technologies and proposes possible amendments, which suggests that the paper may belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Finally, the paper models a real-world serverless system, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
