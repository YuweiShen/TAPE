The method is based on visual, auditory, and haptic information, which are often used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) applications. The paper also discusses the theoretical properties of the information gain maximization criterion, which is relevant to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
