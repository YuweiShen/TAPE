The use of an ontology to guide and bootstrap the learning of new concepts suggests a strong emphasis on artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The active learning loop and the focus on improving recall suggest a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). The use of semantic search on a library of annotated videos suggests a connection to information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the use of visual media and the focus on detecting arbitrary concepts suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
