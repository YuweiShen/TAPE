The paper also mentions the use of the Transformer model, which is commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV) tasks. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of graph convolutional networks, which are commonly used in graph-based tasks such as social network analysis (cs.SI) and knowledge graph representation (cs.DB).
