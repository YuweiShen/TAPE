This problem is commonly studied in the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) communities. The authors also propose a mathematical abstraction of the problem, which involves defining a lineage forest of cells, which is a problem that falls under the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.CV and cs.DM, followed by cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
