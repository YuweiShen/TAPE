The use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and A2C algorithm suggests that the paper may also belong to the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The optimization problem being solved involves multiple objectives, which may indicate that the paper belongs to the subfield of control systems (cs.SY) or information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
