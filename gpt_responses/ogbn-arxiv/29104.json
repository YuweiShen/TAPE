Therefore, cs.IR is the most likely category. The paper also discusses the evaluation of autotagging systems, which involves machine learning techniques, making cs.SD (Software Engineering) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) likely categories as well. The paper also deals with the use of datasets and procedures that are standard in MIR, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks).
