This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also introduces a new interactive learning framework, which involves asking questions, indicating that it may also be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-categories.
