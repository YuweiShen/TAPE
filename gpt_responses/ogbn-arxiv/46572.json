This falls under the areas of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG), as well as Databases (cs.DB) and Software Engineering (cs.SE) due to the focus on automating the demanding task of rule authoring. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for rule authoring, which falls under the area of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
