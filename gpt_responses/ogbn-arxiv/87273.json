The proposed self-learning annotation scheme and AI framework involve training and optimizing the models, which also falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of K-means clustering algorithm and merging conditions for initial labelling information involves information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. Finally, the use of dermoscopy images and the focus on skin lesion classification suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
