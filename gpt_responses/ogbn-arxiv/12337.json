The authors propose the use of neural network architectures, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the authors evaluate their approach on a dataset and provide a video showing their results, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
