This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and network science (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the limitations of existing methods that use hand-crafted features (cs.SD) and graph kernels (cs.NE). Finally, the experiments involve analyzing large collections of real-world networks (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
