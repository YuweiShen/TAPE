Specifically, it focuses on the segmentation of coronary arteries from intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) images. This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves the use of medical imaging (cs.MM) and deep neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
