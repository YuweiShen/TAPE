This involves interpolation and beamforming techniques, which are related to information theory.\n- cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper deals with direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in radar, which is a signal processing problem. The proposed method involves folding the received data into a tensorial structure and applying tensor-based methods for DOA estimation.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a method for improving the performance of a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar system by optimizing the transmit array and using tensor-based methods for DOA estimation. This is related to systems and control theory.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses tensor-based methods for DOA estimation, which can be seen as a form of machine learning. Tensor decomposition is a popular technique in machine learning for analyzing high-dimensional data.\n- cs.SP (Signal Processing): Similar to cs.SI, the paper deals with signal processing techniques for DOA estimation in radar. The proposed method involves interpolation and beamforming techniques, which are also related to signal processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
