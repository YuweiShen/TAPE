The paper proposes a new module that can be added to any existing CNN topology and is trained along with the rest of the network in an end-to-end manner. The paper also discusses the imaging parameters relevant to the task and their dynamics, which are deduced from the variety in the training data. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also discusses the training of the network in an end-to-end manner, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach to blind universal restoration, which may fall under the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of a Self-Normalization Side-Chain (SCNC) module, which may fall under the sub-category cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper deals with image restoration tasks, which may fall under the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
