The paper proposes a solution to find bias in the Streaming API data without the need for expensive Firehose data. This involves analyzing the trend of a hashtag in the Streaming API data and comparing it to its trend in the true activity on Twitter. This methodology involves techniques from social media analysis (cs.SOC), information retrieval (cs.IR), and natural language processing (cs.CL).
