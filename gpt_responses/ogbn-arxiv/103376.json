The paper evaluates six compositional architectures on annotated textual similarity datasets drawn from a wide range of domains. The experiments conducted in the paper are related to natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and neural networks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
