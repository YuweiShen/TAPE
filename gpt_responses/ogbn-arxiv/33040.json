This task is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM). The proposed method uses deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Lastly, the method also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) to generate summaries. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.CV and cs.MM, followed by cs.LG, cs.IR, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
