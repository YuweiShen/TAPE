The proposed method involves the estimation and refinement of transmission maps, which is a common approach in graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. The use of a variational model and regularization terms suggests a focus on optimization (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
