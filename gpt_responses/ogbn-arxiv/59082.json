The proposed Soft Parameters Pruning (SPP) strategy aims to overcome this problem by freeing up parameters that are less important for remembering previous tasks while preserving knowledge about those tasks. This paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CL (Computation and Language) as it deals with deep neural networks, machine learning, and natural language processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
