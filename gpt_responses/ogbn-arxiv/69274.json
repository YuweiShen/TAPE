The paper also mentions popular sequence labeling algorithms such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Conditional Random Fields (CRF), and Support Vector Machines on Structured Output Spaces (StructSVM), which are commonly used in NLP and CV. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
