Therefore, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely categories. The paper also specifically addresses cooperative multiagent problems, which falls under the category of multiagent systems (cs.MA). The proposed architectures and mechanisms are related to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY) as they aim to learn high-level coordination and deal with non-stationarity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
