The method proposed in the paper involves feature extraction and embedding, which are common techniques in computer vision and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves dissimilarity measurement, which is a common problem in information retrieval, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also involves multiscale feature extraction, which is a common technique in multimedia processing, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also involves handcrafted features and competitive performance, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper involves feature extraction and embedding, which are common techniques in deep learning, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
