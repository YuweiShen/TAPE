This involves techniques such as tensor decomposition and network embedding. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is Information Retrieval (cs.IR) as the paper deals with similarity search. Other likely sub-categories include Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) as the paper deals with heterogeneous networks, Machine Learning (cs.LG) as the paper uses embedding techniques, Databases (cs.DB) as the paper deals with data structures and algorithms for efficient search, and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) as the paper proposes a new method for similarity search."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
