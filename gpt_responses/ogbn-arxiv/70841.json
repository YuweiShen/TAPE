The paper also proposes a new feature propagation scheme and a novel feature estimation scheme, which involve machine learning techniques, making it relevant to the cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper addresses the issue of inference speed, which is related to optimization and efficiency, making it relevant to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category.
