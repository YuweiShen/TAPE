It also involves training neural networks, which makes it likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of adaptive training suggests that it may belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the fact that the paper deals with road scenes suggests that it may also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
