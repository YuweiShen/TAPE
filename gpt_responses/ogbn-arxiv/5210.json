This is a common problem in computer vision, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the impact of context on classification tasks, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of heuristic proposal schemes and improved sampling techniques is also relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
