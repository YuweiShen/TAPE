Specifically, the paper focuses on using task meta-features and previous model training experiments to quickly identify a good candidate architecture for a new task. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
