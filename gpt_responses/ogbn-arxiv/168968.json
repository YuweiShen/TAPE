This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions that the proposed models enjoy favorable sample complexity guarantees, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the Computational Economics (cs.CE) sub-category. The paper also deals with large-scale data, which suggests that it may belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions experiments on three large choice datasets, which suggests that it may also belong to the Electronic Commerce (cs.EC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
