The use of deep learning methods and joint-embedding also points towards computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). The focus on language generation and question-answering tasks suggests natural language processing (cs.CL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as likely sub-categories. Finally, the use of inferences about the broader context of the scene suggests information retrieval (cs.IR) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
