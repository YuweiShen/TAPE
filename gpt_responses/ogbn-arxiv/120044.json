Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper proposes a data augmentation technique and uses neural models, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions the use of neural models for coreference resolution, which could place it in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper discusses the use of visual cues for coreference resolution, which could suggest a connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
