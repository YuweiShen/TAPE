The authors propose a new method for disentangling object classification and regression, which involves self-learned optimal feature extraction, suggesting a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions an ensemble strategy and several training/inferencing strategies, indicating a potential focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
