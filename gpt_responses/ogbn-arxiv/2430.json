This involves image processing and feature extraction, which falls under the domain of computer vision. \n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The decoder in the proposed model is a stacked bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) model integrated with soft attention mechanism, which works as a language model to translate the encoder output into a sequence of LaTeX tokens. This involves natural language processing, which falls under the domain of computation and language. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed model is a deep neural network that is trained using Maximum-Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and a new objective function inspired by the policy gradient algorithm from reinforcement learning. This involves machine learning techniques, which falls under the domain of machine learning. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed model involves the use of deep neural networks and machine learning techniques to translate mathematical formula images into LaTeX sequences. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.DL (Deep Learning): The proposed model is a deep neural network that involves the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and stacked bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) models.
