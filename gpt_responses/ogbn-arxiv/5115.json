This falls under the scope of systems and control. \n- cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The paper considers a multi-agent system where the followers interact over a directed acyclic graph. The problem of leader-following is a common topic in multi-agent systems. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper mentions that the followers can be mobile agents whose state or part of their state is their position vector. This suggests that the paper may be relevant to robotics. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a distributed algorithm for the followers to track the sampled state of the leader. This falls under the scope of distributed computing. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an algorithm for the followers to track the sampled state of the leader, which involves decision-making and control. This may be relevant to artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
