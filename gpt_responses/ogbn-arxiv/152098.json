The use of differential behavior criteria to generate corner cases for testing also relates to software engineering (cs.SE) and system testing (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper explores the use of photo-realistic images and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for testing, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
