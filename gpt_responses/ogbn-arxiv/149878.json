The approach also involves visual reporting and user interaction, which suggests a human-computer interaction (cs.HC) aspect. The use of a list representation and tracking progress on solving issues suggests a database (cs.DB) or programming languages (cs.PL) aspect. Finally, the live inspection approach could also be relevant to cybersecurity (cs.CY) as it involves detecting potential vulnerabilities in real-time."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
