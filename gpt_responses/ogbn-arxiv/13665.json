The paper also proposes a cooperative feedback strategy to improve channel quantization performance, which is related to machine learning (cs.MM) and optimization (cs.LG). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.IT, followed by cs.NI, cs.SY, cs.MM, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
