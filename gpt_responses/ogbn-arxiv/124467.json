Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also involves analysis of the number of comparisons made by the algorithms, which falls under cs.AL (Computational Complexity) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The use of distributional equations and Zolotarev metric space suggests a connection to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
