This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes the use of an ensemble of Hankel matrices for emotion classification, which involves machine learning techniques such as nearest neighbor and majority vote schema. Therefore, it is likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories as well. Additionally, the paper focuses on the dynamics of appearance feature time series for emotion recognition, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and affective computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
