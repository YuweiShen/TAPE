However, given that the proposed solution involves training modular redundancies to validate input samples in parallel with the victim DL model, it is most likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the use of DL in critical and time-sensitive applications such as unmanned vehicles, drones, and video surveillance systems suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper's emphasis on hardware/software/algorithm co-design and customized acceleration suggests that it may also be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
