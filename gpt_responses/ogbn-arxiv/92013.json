The paper also discusses the use of higher-order tensors in invariant networks, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE). The paper's focus on symmetry transformations and permuting coordinates suggests that it may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper's exploration of the universality of invariant networks could also be relevant to the subfield of computational complexity (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
