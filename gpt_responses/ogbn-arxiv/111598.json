The use of graph mining methods and distributed systems suggests that the paper could belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) or Databases (cs.DB) sub-categories. The focus on communication cost and I/O costs suggests that the paper could also belong to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories.
