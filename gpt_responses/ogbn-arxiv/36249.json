The use of deep learning models to replace traditional index structures suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the theoretical analysis of learned indexes, which could fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category.
