This is a classic topic in algorithms research.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of experiments to explore the performance of the proposed allocation mechanisms. This is a common topic in machine learning research.\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the behavioural economics aspect of people being averse to inequality and making choices to avoid unequal outcomes.
