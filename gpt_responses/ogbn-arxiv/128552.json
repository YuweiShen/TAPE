Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves statistical analysis of channel conditions, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The use of mobility management parameters suggests the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The paper also deals with maintaining seamless connectivity, which is a system-level issue, and hence, the category of systems and control (cs.SY) is also likely. Finally, the paper mentions vehicular users, which suggests the category of multimedia (cs.MM) as it involves the transmission of audio and video data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
