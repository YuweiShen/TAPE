The paper also discusses the application of the theory to convolutional neural networks (cs.CV) and residual neural networks (cs.AI), which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is a popular optimization algorithm in machine learning and falls under the category of control and optimization (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
