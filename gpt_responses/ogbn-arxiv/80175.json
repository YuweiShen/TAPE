The proposed algorithm involves the use of iterative re-weighted least-squares implementation, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing is a common technique in neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
