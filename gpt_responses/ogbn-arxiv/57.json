The paper also introduces and studies maximal invariant sets of piecewise linear transformations, which is a topic in dynamical systems (cs.DS) and control theory (cs.SY). The techniques used in the paper involve non-ergodicity of dynamical systems, which is a topic in statistical mechanics and probability theory (cs.SD). Finally, the paper involves parameterization of triples $(a,b,c)$, which is a topic in numerical analysis and optimization (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
