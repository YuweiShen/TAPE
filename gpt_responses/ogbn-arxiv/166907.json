The paper proposes a new strategy based on channel diagonalization and cyclic communication, which is a common technique in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with a multi-way relay channel, which is a common problem in networking. The paper proposes a new transmission strategy that can be applied to wireless networks. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with a multi-way relay channel, which is a common problem in social and information networks. The paper proposes a new transmission strategy that can be applied to social and information networks. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with a multi-way relay channel, which is a common problem in multimedia communication. The paper proposes a new transmission strategy that can be applied to multimedia communication. \n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper deals with a multi-way relay channel, which is a common problem in computational engineering and science.
