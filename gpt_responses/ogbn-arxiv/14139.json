This involves optimizing the achievable rate subject to a constraint on the pattern transmission probability distribution. The problem is related to information theory (cs.IT) and communication systems (cs.COMM), as well as signal processing (cs.SI), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
