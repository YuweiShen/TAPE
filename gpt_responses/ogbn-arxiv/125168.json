The Networked and Internet Systems (cs.NI) sub-category is also likely as the paper discusses the factors that influence performance variations in IaaS systems, which includes network performance. The Operating Systems (cs.OS) sub-category is another possibility as the paper evaluates the performance of different cloud platforms. The Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category is also possible as the paper discusses the impact of multi-tenancy on performance and predictability, which is a security concern. Finally, the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category is a possibility as the paper conducts real-life experimentation to validate hypotheses, which involves software development and testing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
