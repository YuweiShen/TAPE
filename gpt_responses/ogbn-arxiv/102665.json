Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves machine learning techniques, such as word embedding layer initialization, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with noisy and non-canonical data, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper involves evaluating the effectiveness of different strategies, which could also fall under cs.SD (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
