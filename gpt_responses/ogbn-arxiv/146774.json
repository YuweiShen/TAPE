The paper also mentions the need for crowd sourced labelling and the use of cloud-based models, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of drones for capturing video footage and the mention of monitoring speed suggest a possible connection to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses the end use of the evolving model, which could involve information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
