The use of dynamic motion primitives and neural network controllers also suggests that it could belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The mention of a global goal scoring estimator and the use of expert demonstrations suggest that it could also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category.
