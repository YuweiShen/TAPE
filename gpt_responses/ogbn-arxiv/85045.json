This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category, which deals with the design, development, and maintenance of software systems. \n\nThe paper also mentions the need to preserve a desired property from a high-level design into a low-level platform implementation, which suggests that it may be relevant to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category, which deals with the design and analysis of secure systems. \n\nThe paper proposes a technique for synthesizing a mapping based on symbolic constraint search, which suggests that it may be relevant to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category, which deals with the design and implementation of programming languages and their compilers. \n\nThe paper also provides a formalization of the synthesis problem, which suggests that it may be relevant to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category, which deals with the use of logic and formal methods in computer science. \n\nFinally, the paper describes a case study demonstrating the application of the technique to synthesizing secure platform mappings for OAuth, a popular family of authorization protocols on the web, which suggests that it may be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category, which deals with the design"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
