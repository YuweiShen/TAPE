The paper presents a novel clustering objective for unsupervised image classification and segmentation, which is a common topic in computer vision (cs.CV). The method involves learning a neural network classifier from scratch, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The objective is based on information theory, which is also relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
