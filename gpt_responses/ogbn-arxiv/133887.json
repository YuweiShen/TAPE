The use of automata and weights also suggests connections to formal languages and logic (cs.LO), while the optimization aspect involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also deals with a specific subclass of priced timed games, which could be of interest to researchers in programming languages (cs.PL) who work on timed automata and verification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
