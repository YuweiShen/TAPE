The model is based on a two-branch encoder-decoder architecture and is evaluated on image classification tasks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Neural networks (cs.NE) and computational linguistics (cs.CL) are also possible sub-categories, as the paper proposes a new training objective and discusses the behavior of the model."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
