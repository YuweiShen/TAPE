The method involves aligning layers and sharing weights, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also mentions the potential for reducing training overhead, which could be relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) where training large language models can be computationally expensive."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
