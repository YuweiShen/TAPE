This involves learning an explicit latent representation of unknown environment properties to facilitate generalization on novel environments at test time. The approach also uses a neural network ensemble that models dynamics and captures uncertainty over dynamics. Given these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
