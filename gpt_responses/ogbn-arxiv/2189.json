The focus is on image recognition and content analysis, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The use of hashtags and social network information also suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and social networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper involves natural language processing (cs.CL) in the analysis of hashtags.
