This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the use of low-complexity implementation and optimal filters, which are relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents mathematical derivations and analyses, which could be classified under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
