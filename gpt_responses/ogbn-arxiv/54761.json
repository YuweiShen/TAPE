The use of proximal quasi-Newton methods is a specific technique that is often used in large-scale optimization problems, which suggests the paper may belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.Optimization. The paper also discusses convergence rates and practical considerations, which suggests it may belong to cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) or cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). Finally, the paper specifically mentions the case of strongly convex functions, which suggests it may belong to cs.SC (Symbolic Computation and Algebraic Manipulation)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
