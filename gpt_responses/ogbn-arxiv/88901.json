The paper also focuses on weakly supervised learning, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of saliency maps and image-level annotations suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
