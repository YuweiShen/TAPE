This falls under the scope of operating systems.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a distributed platform for battery measurements, which involves designing and deploying a combination of hardware and software solutions. This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a distributed platform for battery measurements, which involves sharing existing battery testing setups and transforming them into a planetary-scale measurement platform. This falls under the scope of distributed computing.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the design and deployment of a distributed platform for battery measurements, which involves enabling communication between heterogeneous devices. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the accuracy of battery reporting and system benchmarking, which involves analyzing and processing data. This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
