The paper introduces a new model for investigating QCSP complexity, which involves restricting the types of constraints given by the existentially quantified variables. This topic is closely related to computational complexity, artificial intelligence, and discrete mathematics, which are covered by the cs.CC, cs.AI, cs.DS, cs.LO, and cs.DM sub-categories of arXiv CS. Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
