This involves studying the effective capacity (EC) of the NOMA users and comparing it with orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in different scenarios. This topic falls under the intersection of several computer science sub-categories such as Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
