This involves the use of deep bidirectional transformers for named entity recognition (NER) and slot tagging. The paper also discusses the challenges of training NLU components for conversational agents, which suggests that it could be relevant to the categories of natural language processing (cs.CL), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the focus on the biomedical domain suggests that it could be relevant to the categories of neural engineering (cs.NE) and computational biology (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
