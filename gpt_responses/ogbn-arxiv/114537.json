This task is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) research. The proposed method utilizes semantic information and attention mechanisms, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
