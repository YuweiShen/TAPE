The paper also specifically mentions applications to on-line indexing, which suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) or Database (cs.DB) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a new algorithm for constructing suffix trees in worst case time $O(\\log n)$ per input symbol, which is a data structure problem and suggests that the paper may belong to the Data Structures (cs.DS) sub-category. The paper also mentions applications to dynamic lowest common ancestors and order maintenance, which are problems in computational geometry and combinatorial algorithms, suggesting that the paper may belong to the Computational Geometry (cs.CG) or Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a general technique that is more general than previous work, which suggests that the paper may belong to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
