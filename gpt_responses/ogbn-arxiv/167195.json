It also involves the study of structural properties of graphs, such as partial 2-trees and triconnected simply-nested graphs, which are relevant to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also uses forbidden subgraphs and structural decompositions, which are common techniques in graph theory (cs.DM). The study of triconnected graphs and their outerplanarity index suggests a connection to graph theory and topology (cs.GT). Finally, the paper may have applications in information visualization and human-computer interaction (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
