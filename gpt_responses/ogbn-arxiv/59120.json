The four theorems discussed in the paper cover a range of topics, including selectivity, information, and approximation, which are also relevant to information theory (cs.IT), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Therefore, these five sub-categories are the most likely candidates for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
