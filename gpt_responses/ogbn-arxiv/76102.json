The use of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The mention of different types of images such as natural, face, text, and low-illumination images suggests that it could also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of numerical optimization methods suggests that it could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
