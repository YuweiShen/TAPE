It may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as ridge regression is a commonly used technique in AI. The paper mentions the use of kernel methods, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and statistics (cs.ST). Finally, the paper deals with regression, which is a common problem in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
