The paper also discusses the use of traditional robotic tools and techniques to extend state-of-the-art DRL implementations, which suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The empirical study conducted in both simulation and real robot environments involves evaluating the performance of DRL methods, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the transfer of DRL methods from simulation to reality, which suggests a focus on control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of simulation to evaluate the robot's performance, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
