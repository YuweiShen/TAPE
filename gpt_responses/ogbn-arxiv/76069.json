The use of caches also suggests a connection to distributed systems (cs.DS). The problem of PIR involves privacy and security, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also involves coding and decoding techniques, which is related to coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the tradeoff between caching ratio and download cost, which is a topic in optimization and decision making (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
