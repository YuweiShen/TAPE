This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the use of the proposed method for control systems (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the use of multiple sparse GP models for capturing unmodeled dynamics suggests the possibility of neural network-based approaches (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
