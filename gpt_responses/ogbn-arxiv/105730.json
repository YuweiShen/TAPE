Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses training methods and regularization techniques, which are related to machine learning and optimization, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. The use of adversarial training also suggests cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the problem of image corruptions, which can be seen as a form of attack, making cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
