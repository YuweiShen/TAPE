The study also involves understanding the dynamics of the robots, which can be related to distributed systems (cs.DS) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The presence of faults and the need for fault tolerance can be linked to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of algorithms and mathematical analysis suggests a connection to mathematical aspects of computer science (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
