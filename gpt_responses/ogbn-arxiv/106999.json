The paper discusses experiments conducted on models trained on MNIST or ImageNet and decision tree models, which suggests that the method is a general way to boost the performance of current adversarial attack methods. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper mentions Bayesian Optimization and successive halving, which are commonly used in optimization and search algorithms, suggesting that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
