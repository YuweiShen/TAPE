This falls under the scope of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a fully-integrated radar and communication system, which involves networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a system that integrates communication and sensing, which falls under the scope of systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper involves the use of radar sensing, which can be considered a form of multimedia. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although not the main focus of the paper, the integration of radar and communication systems may have implications for security and cryptography."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
