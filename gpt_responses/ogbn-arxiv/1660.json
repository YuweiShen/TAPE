This involves using real-time physiological data and eye-tracking data to optimize search duration and improve efficiency while preserving decision accuracy. The paper also mentions a scenario motivated from human supervisory control in surveillance missions, indicating a potential application in human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the use of image clutter and functional models of detection accuracy suggest a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The probabilistic estimations and experimental evaluation also suggest a potential focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
