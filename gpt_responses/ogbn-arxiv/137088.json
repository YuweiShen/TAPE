The focus on constructing a bibliographic dataset for systematic reviews suggests that cs.DL (Digital Libraries) is the most likely sub-category. The use of keyword-based search and literature-based discovery also suggests relevance to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The methodology of cascading citation expansion and the visualization of research fields suggest relevance to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.CY (Computers and Society). Finally, the use of network visualization overlays suggests relevance to cs.SD (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
