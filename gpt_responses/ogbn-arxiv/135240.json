The paper also introduces a novel training method for similarity learning, which involves training a deep neural network, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the computational efficiency of the proposed method, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
