This falls under the sub-category of \"Sound and Music Computing\" (cs.SD). The paper also discusses hidden Markov models and probabilistic context-free grammar models, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The unsupervised learning techniques for inducing latent grammar from data also falls under the sub-category of \"Statistical Learning\" (cs.SI).
