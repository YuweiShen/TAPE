The method involves generating short videos of CT slices through the depth of each quadrant of a patient's lung and outsourcing the annotation task to an online community of non-expert users. This involves aspects of computer vision (cs.CV) in generating the videos and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) in designing the crowdsourcing workflow. The use of crowdsourcing also falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) as it involves collecting and analyzing data from a large number of non-expert users. Finally, the paper also touches upon the potential use of the presented workflow in combination with computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithms, which falls under the category of cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
