The paper also mentions the use of machine learning techniques to capture spatial invariants, which suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the use of exploratory conditions to facilitate the emergence of spatial representations, which suggests a connection to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
