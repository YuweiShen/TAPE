The approach involves adding a new prediction head to the network, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The paper also discusses loss combinations and improvements on metrics, which are common topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the approach on the MS COCO dataset, which is a popular benchmark in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
