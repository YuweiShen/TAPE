The paper proposes a novel bi-level actor-critic learning method for finding Stackelberg equilibrium in Markov games. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.MA (Multiagent Systems). Additionally, the paper also involves reinforcement learning, which is a popular technique in artificial intelligence, so cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also discusses convergence proofs and optimization, which are topics in machine learning and optimization, respectively, so cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.GT (Game Theory), and cs.SY (Systems and Control) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
