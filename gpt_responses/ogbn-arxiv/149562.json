The authors also develop algorithms that use dynamic programming techniques and additional heuristics, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of computer vision techniques to detect and track objects on a moving conveyor (cs.CV). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of real-time performance, which is relevant to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
