The paper proposes a novel approach for adapting a scene coordinate regression network for online use, which involves predicting points in one scene and then looking up clusters of points in another scene. This involves techniques from computer vision (such as feature extraction and matching) as well as machine learning (such as regression forests and neural networks). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.RO (Robotics), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
