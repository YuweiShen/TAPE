The proposed method involves the use of a graph-based network for relational reasoning, which is also relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of deep learning techniques such as CNNs and GCNs suggests that this paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the task of text detection is often related to information retrieval (cs.IR), as it involves finding and extracting relevant information from images."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
