The focus is on mission-critical software domains, which suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also mentions scalability, skills, and education as key challenges, which are relevant to programming languages (cs.PL) and logic (cs.LO). The negative perception of ease of use and the need for future research suggest a connection to computer security (cs.CR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
