The paper also discusses the use of heuristics and sampling-based methods, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of optimization techniques, which are relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses experiments involving high-dimensional planning problems, which are often encountered in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
