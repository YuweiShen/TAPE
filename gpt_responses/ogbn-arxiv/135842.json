This falls under the scope of information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses a multi-way relay network where a common user facilitates communication between other users. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with a network where multiple users exchange information through a common user. This falls under the scope of social and information networks.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper considers M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation with square constellation as a special case of lattice code transmission. This falls under the scope of multimedia.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes a novel user pairing scheme and derives upper bounds on the average common rate and the average sum rate. This falls under the scope of computational engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
