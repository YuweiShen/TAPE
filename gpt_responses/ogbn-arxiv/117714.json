The network uses dilated-convolutions to capture subtle changes in the eye images, which is a technique commonly used in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the subject-dependent bias in gaze estimation, which is a topic related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The proposed calibration method involves estimating the bias from a few images taken as the subject gazes at only a few or even just a single gaze target, which is a technique commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
