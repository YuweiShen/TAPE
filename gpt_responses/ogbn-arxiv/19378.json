This involves the use of multiple deep learning classifiers, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of natural language processing techniques to extract biomarkers from the histopathological images, which could fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories. Finally, the paper mentions the use of neural networks for prediction, which falls under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
