The procedure combines a classical algebraic rewrite system for knowledge with an operational semantics for quantum distributed computing, which involves the study of quantum information theory (cs.IT) and programming languages for quantum computing (cs.PL). The paper also analyzes different scenarios based on the safety assumptions of the classical and quantum channels, which involves the study of network protocols and distributed systems (cs.ET). Finally, the paper uses epistemic analysis based on classical knowledge, which involves the study of logic and reasoning (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
