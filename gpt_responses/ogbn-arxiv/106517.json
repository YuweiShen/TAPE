The paper proposes a watermarking framework for DNNs, which falls under the machine learning and computer vision domains, making cs.LG and cs.CV likely categories as well. The paper also mentions targeted adversarial attacks, which is a common technique in the field of computer vision and multimedia, making cs.MM a possible category. Finally, the paper uses fine-tuning to embed the watermark, which is a common technique in the field of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
