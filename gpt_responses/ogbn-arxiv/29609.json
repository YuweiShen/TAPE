The algorithmic framework is based on a weighted separator theorem and treewidth techniques, which are also common in computational complexity (cs.CC) and graph theory (cs.GT). The lower bound framework is based on the Exponential Time Hypothesis and constructive embeddings, which are relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
