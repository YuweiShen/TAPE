The use of gradient descent and its variants is common in these fields, and the focus on saddle point evasion is a current area of research. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also mentions an application to online tensor decomposition, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
