The paper also mentions treewidth, which is a concept from graph theory and algorithms (cs.DS). The topic of tightness is also related to the study of topological spaces and graphs, which falls under the category of graph theory (cs.GT) and structural dynamics (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
