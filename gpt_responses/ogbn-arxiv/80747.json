The paper also proposes a method that combines symbolic planning methods with deep learning, which falls under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of visual input suggests that computer vision (cs.CV) may also be a relevant sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the challenges of grounding symbols from sensor data in a partially-observable world, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
