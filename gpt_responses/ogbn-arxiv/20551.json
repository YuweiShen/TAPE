The paper also discusses the security and reliability of the system, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of distributed ledgers and blockchains involves data structures and algorithms, which are studied in computer science theory (cs.DS). The paper proposes the use of a specialized blockchain, which is related to database systems (cs.DB). Finally, the paper discusses client utility and append models, which are related to machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
