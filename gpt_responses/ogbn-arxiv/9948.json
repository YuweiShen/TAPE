The use of surrogate benchmarks is a technique that involves constructing a regression model, which is also a common approach in machine learning and data science (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the optimization of solvers for hard combinatorial problems, which is a topic in computational engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the use of surrogate benchmarks is a technique that involves approximating the response surface of the true target algorithm performance, which is a common approach in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
