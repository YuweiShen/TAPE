Additionally, the use of a two-stage framework and joint shape representation and classification suggests that machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) techniques are also involved. The focus on detecting pancreatic cancer in CT scans suggests that the medical imaging (cs.MED) sub-category is also relevant. Finally, the use of classification techniques suggests that the neural networks (cs.NEURON) sub-category may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
