The concept of update functions and interaction graphs is also related to the field of logic (cs.LO). The use of larger alphabets and projection/restriction operations involves information theory (cs.IT). The study of synchronous, asynchronous, and sequential updates is related to the field of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper also deals with the characterization of sets of functions, which is a topic in formal languages (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
