This involves the use of task planning and control of whole-body dynamic locomotion behaviors in constrained and dynamically changing environments. The paper also discusses the use of a two-player temporal logic game to synthesize a winning strategy that delivers symbolic locomotion actions, which satisfies the desired high-level task specifications expressed in a fragment of temporal logic. These actions are then sent to a robust finite transition system that synthesizes a locomotion controller that fulfills state reachability constraints. The paper also discusses the use of a low-level motion planner that generates feasible locomotion trajectories. Overall, the paper deals with topics related to robotics, artificial intelligence, control systems, and planning, which are all sub-categories of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.RO (Robotics), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
