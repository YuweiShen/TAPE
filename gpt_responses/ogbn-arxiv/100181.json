The use of Yao subgraphs and disk graphs also suggests a possible categorization under data structures (cs.DS) or discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the motivation for the study of connectivity properties in mobile networks with directional antennas suggests a possible categorization under social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
