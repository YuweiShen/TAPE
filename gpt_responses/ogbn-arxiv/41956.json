The use of point processes and asymptotic analysis suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of mathematical analysis (cs.MA) and statistical theory (cs.SI). Finally, the study of network geometry and interference-to-signal ratios may also be relevant to the sub-category of game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
