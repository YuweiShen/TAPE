The paper also discusses the allocation and scheduling phases of the problem, which could be categorized under Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The use of Linear Programming and List Scheduling policies suggests a possible category of Probability and Statistics (cs.PF). The paper also proposes an on-line scheduling algorithm, which could be categorized under Software Engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the use of different types of computing units and the experimentation on actual libraries suggests a possible category of Programming Languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
