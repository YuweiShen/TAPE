The use of a vending machine to control the acquisition of side information is a novel concept that could also be relevant to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also discusses the design of optimal coding strategies, which is a topic that falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
