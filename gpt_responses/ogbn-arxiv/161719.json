It discusses the problem of managing proof contexts and proposes a new approach to managing them using context linking and caching. The paper also evaluates the proposed approach using case studies drawn from practice. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.SE (Software Engineering), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
