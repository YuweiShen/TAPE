This problem is relevant to several applications such as disease diagnosis and fault diagnosis in computer networks. The proposed algorithm uses a rank-based greedy approach to maximize the area under the ROC curve of the output. This approach significantly reduces the complexity of active query selection, making it more efficient for large networks. Based on this description, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an algorithm for active diagnosis, which involves selecting queries based on observed responses. This is a common problem in AI, and the proposed approach may involve machine learning techniques. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a rank-based greedy algorithm for active diagnosis, which involves selecting queries to maximize the area under the ROC curve of the output. This approach may involve supervised learning techniques to optimize the selection of queries. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new algorithm for active diagnosis that reduces the complexity of query selection. This is a problem in algorithm design, and the proposed approach may involve data structures and optimization techniques. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The problem of fault diagnosis in computer networks is a common application of active diagnosis.
