The specific problems addressed in the paper, partial clustering, are also relevant to Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The use of partial optimizations and the consideration of noise in large data scenarios suggest a connection to Databases (cs.DB) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
