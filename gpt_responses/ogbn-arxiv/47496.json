The techniques used involve matrices and lifting methods, which are common tools in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the properties of simplicial polytopes, which is a topic in combinatorics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper provides complexity bounds for the constructions, which is a topic in theoretical computer science (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
