Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses multi-task and curriculum learning, which are topics related to machine learning. Hence, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. The paper uses publicly available datasets, which suggests that it may fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
