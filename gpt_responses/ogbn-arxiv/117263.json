The paper also introduces a new asymmetric query model and provides a lower bound on the number of queries required in this model. These topics are closely related to data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
