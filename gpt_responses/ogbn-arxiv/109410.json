This suggests that the paper may belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of random matrix theory, which is often used in Statistical Learning (cs.LG) and Signal Processing (cs.SI) research. Finally, the paper specifically focuses on Massive MIMO systems, which is a topic that falls under the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT and cs.NI, followed by cs.SI, cs.LG, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
