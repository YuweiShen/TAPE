Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a multi-mapping mechanism and posterior mapping selection, which involve machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. The model optimization and selection process also involve deep learning and neural networks, which are common in cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach to modeling the one-to-many relationship, which can be considered as a problem in optimization and decision-making, making cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) possible sub-categories as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
