The use of trace class operators and quantum information theory also suggests a possible connection to signal processing and information theory (cs.SI). The problem of optimal link adaptation is also relevant to networked systems and networking protocols (cs.NI), as well as control and optimization in communication systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
