The paper focuses on building computational models to discriminate effective questions from ineffective ones, which falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). Specifically, the paper uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to predict whether a question will be answered based on a large-scale dataset collected from Reddit. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
