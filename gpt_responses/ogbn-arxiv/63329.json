This involves the use of abstract interpretation-based checker and the design of the checker. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also deals with software safety and correctness, which suggests the category cs.SE (Software Engineering). The paper also mentions the use of fixpoint abstraction, which is related to the category cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also deals with security and safety policies, which suggests the category cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper mentions the implementation and benchmarking of the proposed approach, which suggests the category cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
