The use of linear binary codes is also a common technique in coding theory (cs.DS) and error-correcting codes (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the entropy rate of the output, which is a concept often studied in information theory and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
