The use of word embeddings and deep neural networks also suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the use of SVMs and surface features could also place it in the sub-categories of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) as these techniques are commonly used in these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
