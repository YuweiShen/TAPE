This falls under the domain of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR), which are covered under cs.CL. The use of neural network models and semi-supervised learning techniques suggests that the paper may also fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper may involve image processing techniques for analyzing resumes, which falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
