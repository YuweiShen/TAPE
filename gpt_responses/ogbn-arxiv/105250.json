The paper combines elements from distributional reinforcement learning and approximate Bayesian inference techniques with neural networks. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
