The use of quantized measurements suggests that information theory (IT) may be relevant, as well as machine learning (LG) and signal processing (SP). The mention of low-rank matrices and compressible signals suggests that matrix methods (MM) and computer vision (CV) may also be relevant. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT, cs.LG, cs.SP, cs.MM, and cs.CV, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
