The paper specifically focuses on dropout variational inference and alpha-divergences as alternative divergences to VI's KL objective. These topics are closely related to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and systems and control (cs.SY). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
