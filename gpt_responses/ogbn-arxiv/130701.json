The use of amplify and forward (AF) strategy and power minimization problem suggests the possibility of optimization techniques (cs.SY). The consideration of multiple relays and the asymptotic regime of large number of relays may involve multiple access (cs.MM) and communication and information theory (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
