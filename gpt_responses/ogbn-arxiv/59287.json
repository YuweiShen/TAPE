Computer vision techniques are used to process the collected traces and detect the overall floorplan shape as well as higher level semantics such as detecting rooms and corridors shapes. \n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - The paper discusses the use of crowdsourcing to collect data from users of a building to construct indoor floorplans. The system is designed to be transparent and automatic, leveraging the sensors in smartphones that are ubiquitously available with humans who use a building. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper discusses the use of crowdsourcing to collect data from users of a building to construct indoor floorplans.
