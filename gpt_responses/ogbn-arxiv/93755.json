This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of formal program verification, which is a topic that falls under the cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) sub-categories.
