The paper also proposes a low complexity radar sensor design, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SP). Finally, the paper discusses recovery guarantees for structured measurement matrices, which could fall under statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
