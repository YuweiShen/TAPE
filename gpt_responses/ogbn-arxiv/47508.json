The paper also discusses the use of LSA in dealing with polysemy and synonymy, which are common issues in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also mentions the use of Perron-Frobenius theory, which is a mathematical tool commonly used in Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the selection of perturbed Perron vectors, which is a method that can be used in various applications of LSA, including Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
