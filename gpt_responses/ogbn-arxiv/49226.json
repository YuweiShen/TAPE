Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses the application of EM in linear Gaussian state space models, which falls under the sub-category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper discusses the use of EM to break cycles in factor graphs, which is related to the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
