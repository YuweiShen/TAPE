Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also focuses on web development and user interaction, which suggests the category cs.WEB (Web Applications). Additionally, the paper discusses network protocols and data transmission, which could fall under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also mentions trade-offs and empirical studies, which could relate to cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
