The work proposes a novel on-the-fly learning model for data recovery, which is implemented in the file system. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper addresses the security and privacy concerns in Edge computing environments, specifically the malicious deletion of mission-critical data due to ransomware, trojans, and viruses. The proposed file system aims to provide efficient post-deletion data recovery and maintain data integrity. \n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): Edge computing involves distributed computing and storage resources, and the proposed file system aims to provide an optimal scheme for data protection in such environments. \n4. cs.DB (Databases): The paper discusses the challenges in providing efficient data recovery in Edge computing environments with compute and storage limitations. The proposed file system provides an Adaptive Recover-ability Aware file allocation platform for efficient post-deletion data recovery. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a novel on-the-fly learning model for data recovery, which is implemented in the file system. The work also evaluates the overhead characteristics of the proposed file system and compares it with other related works."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
