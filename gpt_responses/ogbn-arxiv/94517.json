The use of Shape Expression schema (ShEx) to specify constraints on the target RDF graph suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques for data modeling and validation. The paper also proposes a method for translating ShEx into a set of target dependencies, which is a topic related to software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
