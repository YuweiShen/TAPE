The use of a multi-regional multi-label CNN for predicting semantic concepts and a context-gated sentence generation scheme for semantic order learning also suggests that this paper could be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the fact that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on two public benchmark datasets indicates that this paper could also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
