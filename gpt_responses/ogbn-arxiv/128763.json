The paper also discusses machine learning techniques for learning these models, which could fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions using lattice sampling, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV) as it involves sampling points in a grid-like fashion. Finally, the paper discusses exploiting symmetries, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY) as it involves understanding the properties of the system being controlled."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
