The use of ordinal preferences and the metric assumption on agent costs suggest a connection to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The construction of instances and analysis of worst-case distortion involve algorithmic techniques and data structures (cs.DS). The fairness properties of social choice rules are also discussed, which relates to topics in machine learning and algorithmic fairness (cs.LG, cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
