The paper also proposes a collaborative learning framework, which involves training two different types of detectors jointly, so it could also be relevant to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category. Additionally, the paper introduces a new prediction consistency loss, which is a type of regularization, so it could be relevant to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category. The paper also uses deep learning models, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) tasks, so these categories are also possible."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
