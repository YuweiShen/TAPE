The paper also introduces a new distance metric, which involves modeling signal intensity and is applicable to general, non-positive signals. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG), which often involve developing new distance metrics for classification and clustering tasks. Finally, the paper's focus on transport-based distances and their applications to classification suggests that it may also be relevant to statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
