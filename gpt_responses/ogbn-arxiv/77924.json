The use of weak supervision and curriculum learning strategies suggests a focus on machine learning techniques, which are often found in the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of size estimates and object proposals also suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the use of weights to improve object localization suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
