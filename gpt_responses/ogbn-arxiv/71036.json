The problem also involves multiple servers and the need for privacy, which suggests that it may be related to distributed systems (cs.DS) and security and cryptography (cs.CR). The achievable scheme and information theoretic converse involve coding and communication, which could fall under computer communications (cs.CC). Finally, the problem of private information delivery may have applications in privacy-preserving data analysis, which could relate to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
