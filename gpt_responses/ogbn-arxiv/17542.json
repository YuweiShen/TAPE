Additionally, the platform is designed to enable collaboration between security and usability researchers, indicating a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The use of cryptography and secure cryptographic operations also suggests a potential fit for the categories of cryptography (cs.CY) and software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the platform is designed to work with existing web applications, indicating a potential fit for the category of programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
