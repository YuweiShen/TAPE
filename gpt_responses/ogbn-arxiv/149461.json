The paper proposes a new approach called Shapley Q-value for credit assignment in global reward games, which is a critical problem in MARL. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.MA. The paper also introduces a cooperative-game theoretical framework and derives an MARL algorithm, which are relevant to cs.GT and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
