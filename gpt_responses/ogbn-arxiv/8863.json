This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of domain augmentation, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of instance normalization, which is commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
