This involves adding an attention module to the feature extractor of an established baseline, resulting in a trainable model that can produce saliency maps. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a new approach to visualize saliency maps for deep neural network models, which is a subfield of machine learning. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper applies the proposed approach to deep reinforcement learning agents, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper involves visualizing saliency maps, which is a subfield of computer vision. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper involves deep neural network models, which is a subfield of neural computing. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper evaluates saliency metrics on the Atari-HEAD dataset of human gameplay, which is a subfield of human-computer interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
