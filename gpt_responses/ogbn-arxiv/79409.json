The paper also discusses channel reciprocity properties and channel parameter estimation algorithms, which are related to networking and communication (cs.NI) and communication systems (cs.COMM). The paper proposes a revision for the standardization 5G channel model, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of its findings on the transmission scheme design for FDD massive MIMO systems, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
