The paper proposes a new algorithm for training object detectors, which involves optimizing the loss function. This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The algorithm also involves sampling techniques, which could be related to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper mentions experiments on datasets, which could be related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
