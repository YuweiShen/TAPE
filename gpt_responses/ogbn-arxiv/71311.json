The paper also mentions the use of query reformulation, which is a common technique in IR. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category as it involves understanding the user's search behavior and query reformulation decisions, which requires natural language processing techniques. \n\nThe Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper aims to better serve the user's information need, which is a key goal of HCI. \n\nThe Deep Learning (cs.DL) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories are also possible as the paper proposes a relevance modelling approach that is driven by the user's search behavior, which could involve the use of machine learning techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
