The paper also mentions the use of algebraic structures, which is related to number theory (cs.NT). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of lattices in cryptography (cs.CR) and signal processing (cs.SI), which are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper mentions generalizations of the constructions, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
