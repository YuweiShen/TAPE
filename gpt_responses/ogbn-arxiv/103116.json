The paper introduces a novel technique called failout, which simulates physical node failure conditions during training using dropout. This technique is specifically designed to improve the resiliency of distributed neural networks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
