The paper also considers interference constraints and time-varying channels, which are topics related to control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.MA). Additionally, the paper proposes two scheduling policies, which involve optimization and decision-making, respectively, and thus could be related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
