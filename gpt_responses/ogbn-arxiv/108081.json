Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new adversarial training scheme, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the security implications of the vulnerability of deep networks to geometric transformations, which could be relevant to the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
