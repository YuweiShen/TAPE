The method involves training an ensemble of classifiers in a self-supervised manner, which is a technique commonly used in deep learning. The paper also proposes a novel margin-based loss function and a method for combining the outputs of the ensemble of classifiers. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves some aspects of computer security (cs.CR) and neural networks (cs.NE), which are less likely but still relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
