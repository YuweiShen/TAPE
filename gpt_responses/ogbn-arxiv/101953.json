The use of leverage scores and nuclear norm minimization are also common techniques in this area. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely category. The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) in terms of the number of observed entries required for exact recovery. Additionally, numerical analysis (cs.NA) is relevant for the analysis of the sampling probabilities. The use of leverage scores also relates to data structures (cs.DS) and the paper discusses experiments on real data (cs.SI, Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
