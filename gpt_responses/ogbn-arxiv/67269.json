The use of nonconvex regularizers is a novel approach that has shown better empirical performance in standard matrix completion (cs.LG). The paper also provides a recovery guarantee for the proposed model, which involves optimization techniques (cs.IT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world data sets involve numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
