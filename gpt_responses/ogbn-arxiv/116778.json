The approach also involves the use of geometric priors, which can be seen as a form of regularization or prior knowledge, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of branch-and-bound algorithm to find a planar patch in a 3D volume also involves computational geometry (cs.GR). Finally, the evaluation is done on image volumes, which can be considered as a sub-topic of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
