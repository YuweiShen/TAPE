This falls under the scope of several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.CL (Computation and Language). However, given the focus on citation networks and topic modeling, cs.DL and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories. The use of a non-parametric extension of the Poisson mixed-topic link model and the author-topic model also suggests a potential fit with cs.LG. The incorporation of supervision into topic modeling could also align with cs.CL. Finally, the use of publicly available corpora and the proposed algorithm for exploring subsets of research publications could be relevant to cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
