The paper discusses the convergence analysis of the algorithm, which is a fundamental problem in information theory and signal processing. Therefore, cs.IT and cs.SI are the most likely categories. The paper also considers the cases where $N_u>N_r$, which is related to the design of wireless networks and communication protocols, and hence, cs.NI is also a likely category. The paper uses the large-scale property of the MIMO-NOMA to simplify the convergence analysis, which is a common technique in machine learning and optimization, and hence, cs.LG is also a likely category. Finally, the paper provides numerical results to verify the theoretical results, which is related to multimedia applications, and hence, cs.MM is also a likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
