The method is applied to large-scale visual tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth regression, which are subfields of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the computational overhead of the method, which is a concern in systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the method involves approximating variance propagation, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks and optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
