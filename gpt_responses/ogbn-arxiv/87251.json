Additionally, the paper proposes a novel criterion for pruning based on neural network interpretability, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also involves computation and parameter storage costs, which suggests that it may belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on a broad range of computer vision datasets, which suggests that it may also belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
