The use of a quadruplet loss also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the use of online hard negative mining suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper also involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques to improve the generalization ability of the model. Finally, the paper may also belong to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category as person re-identification is often used in video surveillance for security purposes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
