These problems are typically studied in the context of data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational geometry (cs.CG), and graph theory (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses space-efficient algorithms, which could also fall under the category of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
