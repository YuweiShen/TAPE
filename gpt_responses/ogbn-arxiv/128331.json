Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communication and Networking). The paper also mentions the use of modulation schemes, which falls under the sub-category cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper discusses the concavity property and Jensen's inequality, which are related to systems and control theory, falling under the sub-category cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper may also fall under the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia), as OFDM is commonly used in multimedia applications such as digital television and audio broadcasting."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
