The method is based on softmax of scaled cosine similarity, which is a technique used in metric learning. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
