The paper also discusses the use of neural networks for training, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The concept of smoothing label/prediction distribution is also mentioned, which is related to probability and statistics (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses downstream tasks, which could involve natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
