The most relevant sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), which focuses on the development and application of neural networks. Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CL (Computation and Language), as these sub-fields are closely related to deep learning and often use neural networks as a tool."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
