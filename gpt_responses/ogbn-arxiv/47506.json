The use of new methods for drawing trees suggests that the paper may also be relevant to data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The problem of drawing trees on fixed points is closely related to graph drawing (cs.GR) and visualization (cs.SI), which further supports these categories as likely choices."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
