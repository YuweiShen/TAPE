The paper focuses on developing a surrogate objective for learning highly exploring and fast mixing policies, which is a core problem in reinforcement learning and falls under the scope of these sub-categories. Additionally, the empirical evaluation of the proposed algorithm is conducted on a set of hard-exploration tasks, which further supports the relevance of these sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
