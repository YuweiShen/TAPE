This involves adapting kernel alignment to active learning with small sample sizes. The paper is focused on machine learning and optimization techniques, which suggests that it is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and social and information networks (cs.SI). However, given the specific focus on outlier detection and hyperparameter estimation, machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
