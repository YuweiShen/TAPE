This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also discusses training strategies and optimization techniques, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of weak supervision and unlabeled data is also mentioned, which relates to neural networks (cs.NE) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
