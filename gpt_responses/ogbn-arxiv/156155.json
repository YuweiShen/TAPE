The proposed methodology for defining changes is flexible and extendible, which suggests an application of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The use of an ontology for storing detected changes and enabling automated processing and analysis of changes is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the proposed detection algorithm and proof-of-concept application suggest a software engineering (cs.SE) aspect to the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
