The paper discusses the impact of entropy regularization on policy optimization and presents new tools for understanding the optimization landscape. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses the impact of entropy on the optimization landscape, which could be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
