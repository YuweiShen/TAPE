The paper proposes a meta-learning approach to enable fast adaptation to previously unseen cameras, which involves training a model on few-shot regression tasks. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper evaluates its approach on publicly available datasets, which indicates that it may also belong to the sub-categories of multimedia (cs.MM) and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
