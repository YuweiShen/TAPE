The paper also addresses security concerns related to digital contracts, which could place it in the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of linear logic and resource analysis, which could place it in the categories of logic in computer science (cs.LO) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of digital contracts implemented in a prototype language, which could place it in the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
