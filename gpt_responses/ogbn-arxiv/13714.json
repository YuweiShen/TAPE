Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. Within cs.CL, the paper could also fit into cs.IR (Information Retrieval) since sentiment analysis is often used in search engines and recommendation systems. Additionally, the paper discusses various techniques and approaches, which could fall under cs.LG (Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper mentions the challenges of Arabic sentiment analysis, which could also make it relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as neural networks are often used to overcome language-specific challenges in NLP."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
