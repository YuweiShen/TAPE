The paper proposes a novel approach for joint quantization of weights and activations, which is a technique commonly used in neural network optimization (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the hardware costs of the proposed approach, which is relevant to computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
