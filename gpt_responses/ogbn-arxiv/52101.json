This is a common problem in machine learning, and the paper provides a new algorithmic framework for solving it efficiently. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Joint alignment is a common problem in computer vision, where the goal is to align multiple images or objects. The paper's proposed algorithm could be useful for solving this problem efficiently. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a new algorithm for solving a discrete assignment problem, which involves pairwise differences. This is a common problem in data structures and algorithms, and the paper provides a new approach for solving it efficiently. \n4. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the problem of recovering discrete variables from noisy observations of their modulo differences. This is a problem that is relevant to information theory, as it involves encoding and decoding information. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new algorithmic framework for solving a joint alignment problem, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence.
