The use of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a signal processing technique that can be categorized under information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the reduction of bias field noise, which is a common problem in medical imaging (cs.NA). Finally, the proposed algorithms for robust registration can be considered as a form of machine learning or pattern recognition (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
