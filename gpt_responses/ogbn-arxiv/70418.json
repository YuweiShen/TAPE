The proposed construction is based on subspace codes, which are a type of error-correcting codes commonly studied in information theory (cs.IT) and coding theory (cs.CC). The application of the scheme is specifically for biometric authentication, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM). Therefore, these five categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
