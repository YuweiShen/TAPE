The paper also proposes a solution using neural networks, which falls under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper uses simulated low-resource scenarios, which could fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE) or computer vision (cs.CV) if image data is involved."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
