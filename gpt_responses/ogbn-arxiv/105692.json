This is a subfield of social and information networks. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a recursive method for obtaining optimal prediction coefficients as the graph expands, which involves manipulating data structures. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for predicting graph signals, which is a task that falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): Although the paper does not explicitly mention neural networks or evolutionary algorithms, these are subfields of computer science that are often used for prediction tasks, and could potentially be used in conjunction with the proposed method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
