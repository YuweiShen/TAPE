Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper uses Word2Vec and BERT, which are deep learning models, and LDA, which is a statistical model, to process and classify the clinical text. Hence, it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper deals with healthcare data, which could make it relevant to cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
