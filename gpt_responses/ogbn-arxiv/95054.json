The use of algorithms to find near-optimum teams suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The large-scale experiments and use of data sets suggest a focus on data science (cs.DS). Finally, the use of social connections and the need to divide tasks among team members suggests a focus on social influence (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
