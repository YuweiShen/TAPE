The use of dynamic programming and minimal separators suggests a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The perfect phylogeny problem is a well-known problem in computational biology, which could also place the paper in the category of computational complexity (cs.CC) or machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
