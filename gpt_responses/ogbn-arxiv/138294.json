Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper proposes an improved mean absolute error (IMAE) loss function, which is a modification of the traditional MAE loss function. This makes it relevant to the sub-category cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
