The paper also proposes new methods for uncertainty estimation that do not require retraining or redesigning the model, which falls under the scope of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of uncertainty estimation to improve neural network training, which is relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
