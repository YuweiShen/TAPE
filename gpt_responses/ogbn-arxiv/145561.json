The paper uses a corpus of texts and identifies a set of features that can describe the phonological, morphological, lexical, syntactic, discursive, and psychological complexity of a given text. The paper then conducts experiments with five machine learning algorithms to classify the texts into three different levels of difficulty. The paper also evaluates the scalability of the classifier to test if it can be used within real applications. Based on this, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with the study of computational aspects of language and the design of algorithms to process and analyze natural language data. The paper's focus on identifying text complexity and using linguistic features to build a classifier makes it relevant to this sub-category. \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data. The paper's use of machine learning algorithms to classify texts based on their complexity makes it relevant to this sub-category. \n\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category deals with the study of techniques and algorithms for searching and retrieving information from large collections of data.
