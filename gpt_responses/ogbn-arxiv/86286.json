The use of finite state machines and the study of their asymptotic speed suggest a connection to the areas of data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). The optimization aspect also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the use of probability models and the analysis of the expected ratio of text accesses suggest a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
