The paper focuses on improving the regularization of RNNs by reconstructing the previous hidden state with the present one. This technique can be applied to different domains, such as image captioning and source code captioning, which suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories. \n\ncs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category since the paper deals with natural language processing tasks, such as caption generation. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is also likely since the paper applies the proposed architecture to image captioning tasks. cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also possible sub-categories since the paper proposes a new architecture for improving the performance of RNNs, which is a common technique in machine learning and AI. Finally, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a less likely sub-category, but still possible since the paper deals with recurrent neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
