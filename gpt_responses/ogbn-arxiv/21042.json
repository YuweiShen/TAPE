The focus on optimization and variance reduction suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the importance of these gradient estimators in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The mention of evolution strategies experiments suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY), and the potential application to a Beta distribution suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
