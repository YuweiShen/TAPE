The paper also deals with control strategies for such engines, which could fall under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The use of support vector machines and extreme learning machines for model development suggests that the paper could also fall under the categories of neural networks (cs.NE) and software engineering (cs.SE). Overall, the most likely category is machine learning (cs.LG), followed by artificial intelligence (cs.AI), control systems (cs.SY), neural networks (cs.NE), and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
