Therefore, cs.CL and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a neural network model, which involves training and optimization, making cs.LG a likely sub-category as well. The paper also deals with information retrieval (IR) and cybernetics (CY) in terms of aggregating signals from external evidence articles and assessing the trustworthiness of their sources.
