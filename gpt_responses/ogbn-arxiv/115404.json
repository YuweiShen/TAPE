Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves data structures and optimization techniques, which are relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The study of area and perimeter optimization falls under cs.GR (Graphics) and the fitting of a point set with a two-joint chain relates to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
