This involves designing an orthogonal D2D multiple access protocol and formulating the optimization problem of joint cellular and D2D resource allocation for downlink transmissions. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper considers the use of millimeter wave (mmWave) links to enable high data rate D2D communications and proposes a virtual antenna array formed by sharing antennas across different terminals to realize the diversity gain of MIMO channels. This involves designing an orthogonal D2D multiple access protocol and formulating the optimization problem of joint cellular and D2D resource allocation for downlink transmissions. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper considers the use of millimeter wave (mmWave) links to enable high data rate D2D communications, which is relevant to multimedia applications that require high bandwidth. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a hybrid D2D-cellular scheme to improve the rate performance for cellular users, which involves designing an orthogonal D2D multiple access protocol and formulating the optimization problem of joint cellular and D2D resource allocation for downlink transmissions.
