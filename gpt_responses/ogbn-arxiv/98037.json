This involves optimization of the sensor deployment and energy-aware transmission policy. The paper also discusses the tradeoff between spreading out the sensors for more informative samples and concentrating them at locations with high energy arrival rates or large channel gains. These topics are related to information theory (cs.IT), control systems (cs.SY), machine learning (cs.MA), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
