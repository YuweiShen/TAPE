This falls under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and social and information networks (cs.SI). The paper also considers the use of this sampling procedure to find a target set of vertices, which relates to graph theory (cs.GT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper derives exact and approximate expressions, which involves information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
