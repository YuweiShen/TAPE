The objective is to minimize the total charging cost with user dissatisfaction taken into account. This involves designing online algorithms with the best possible competitive ratio among all deterministic algorithms. Game theory is often used to study such competitive scenarios. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of online algorithms for EV charging load scheduling in response to real-time electricity prices. Machine learning techniques are often used for online decision-making problems. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper focuses on designing online algorithms for EV charging load scheduling under real-time pricing. This involves developing efficient algorithms for making irrevocable charging decisions in each time slot. \n4. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper considers a demand-response scenario where a user schedules the flexible electric vehicle (EV) charging load in response to real-time electricity prices. This involves optimizing the charging cost with user dissatisfaction taken into account. Computational techniques are often used to solve such optimization problems. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of online algorithms for EV charging load scheduling in response to real-time electricity prices.
