The paper also presents a duplication index and best practices for collecting code corpora, which involves machine learning techniques such as natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance metrics of machine learning models, which is related to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of code corpora, which is related to the programming languages (cs.PL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
