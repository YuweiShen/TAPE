Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of deep models like FastText.zip (FTZ) and the effectiveness of the selected samples for training large models, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of active learning strategies, which could place it in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the creation of tiny high-quality datasets, which could suggest a connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper discusses the problem of sampling bias, which could place it in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
