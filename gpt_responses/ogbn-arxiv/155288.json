This is a clear indication that the paper belongs to the Computer Vision sub-category.\n2. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with mobile visual data and proposes a deep learning approach for efficient feature extraction and recognition. This is a relevant topic for the Multimedia sub-category.\n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper proposes a deep learning approach for mobile visual search, which is a relevant topic for the Information Retrieval sub-category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep learning approach for constructing binary hash codes for mobile visual search. This is a relevant topic for the Machine Learning sub-category.\n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): Although the paper does not deal with natural language processing, it proposes a deep learning approach for mobile visual search, which can be considered as a form of language understanding. Hence, the paper may also be relevant to the Computation and Language sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
