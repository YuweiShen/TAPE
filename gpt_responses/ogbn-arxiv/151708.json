The paper also focuses on improving the understandability and maintainability of tactics, which is relevant to software engineering (cs.SE). The use of functional programming and combinator languages may also relate to programming languages (cs.PL) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the mention of an industrial technology transfer project suggests a possible connection to emerging technologies (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
