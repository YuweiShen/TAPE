It also involves spatial multiplexing and linear receiver structures, which are relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and networked systems (cs.NI). The use of transmit antenna selection and diversity order are also relevant to multimedia systems (cs.MM) and communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
