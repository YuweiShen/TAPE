The use of Turing machines suggests a connection to computability theory, which falls under cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also discusses the quantification over arrow updates, which is a topic in artificial intelligence and decision making, falling under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The paper's focus on the logic's properties and axiomatization suggests a connection to proof theory and computational complexity, falling under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
