The paper discusses the use of information-based criteria in feature/model selection, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also derives close-form relations of normalized mutual information with respect to accuracy, precision, and recall, which are commonly used performance metrics in binary classifications. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the information theory (cs.IT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of normalized mutual information in image classification, which could place it in the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of normalized mutual information in evaluating the performance of classifiers, which could place it in the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
