The paper combines constraints that formalize the background knowledge concerned with qualitative reasoning with appropriate inter-state constraints that are formulated using linear temporal logic. This approach is implemented in a constraint programming system by drawing on ideas from bounded model checking. The paper's focus on constraint programming, qualitative reasoning, and temporal logic suggests that the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Other possible sub-categories include cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.SE (Software Engineering), and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
