Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel transmission scheme, which falls under the category of signal processing and communication, making cs.SI (Signal Processing) a likely sub-category as well. The paper also deals with computation capacity regions, which falls under the category of distributed computing, making cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper draws a parallel with recent results in the context of two-way interference channels, which falls under the category of computer communication networks, making cs.CC (Computer Communication and Networks) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
