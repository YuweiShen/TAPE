The paper discusses the design, dynamics, control, and operation of the microbots used in the SPEER system. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The microbots used in the SPEER system are equipped with an array of adapted COTS sensors, which could potentially involve AI techniques for data processing and analysis. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the dynamics and control of the microbots used in the SPEER system. \n4. cs.ROB (Robotics and Perception): The paper discusses the design and operation of the microbots used in the SPEER system, which involves perception and sensing capabilities. \n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper does not explicitly discuss software engineering, but it is likely that software is involved in the control and operation of the SPEER system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
