The use of Markov decision processes and dynamic decision networks to learn from clinical data and develop complex plans via simulation of alternative sequential decision paths indicates that it could also belong to the cs.LG sub-category. The paper addresses challenges in the healthcare system, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.CY sub-category. The evaluation of the framework using real patient data from an electronic health record indicates that it could also belong to the cs.HC sub-category. Finally, the use of machine learning algorithms for personalized medicine in future work suggests that it could belong to the cs.SI sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
