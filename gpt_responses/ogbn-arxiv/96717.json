The paper also discusses the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) in multi-antenna communications, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper uses analytical methods to evaluate the eigenfunction weights, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
