This involves developing an on-line learning approach based on the Back-Propagation (BP) algorithm for ANNs. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper deals with IoT (Internet of Things) and MA (Multi-Agent Systems) concepts, which are relevant to the implementation of the wireless sensor network. Hence, cs.IOT and cs.MA are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
