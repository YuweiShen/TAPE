This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of Bayesian optimization and Gaussian processes for hyperparameter optimization suggests the paper may also belong to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the proposed non-stationary kernel for the surrogate model and the use of evolutionary strategy may also relate to statistical learning (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
