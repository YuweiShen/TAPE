The use of deep learning techniques for signal classification suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also addresses the issue of interference from jammers, which is a security concern and may place the paper under the sub-category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses blind source separation using independent component analysis, which is a technique commonly used in signal processing and may place the paper under the sub-category of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
