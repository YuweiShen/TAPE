This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication systems (cs.COMM). The paper also addresses the design and performance analysis of the system, which involves signal processing techniques and system modeling, falling under the domains of systems and control (cs.SY) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper presents numerical results of the spectral efficiency for the rate-adaptive systems, which involves performance evaluation and simulation, falling under the domain of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
