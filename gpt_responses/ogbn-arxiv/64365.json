The model uses a novel Dual-Attention unit to disentangle the knowledge of words in the textual representations and visual concepts in the visual representations, and align them with each other. This disentangled task-invariant alignment of representations facilitates grounding and knowledge transfer across both tasks. The paper involves natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning, which are all covered by the above sub-categories. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV, cs.LG, and cs.RO."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
