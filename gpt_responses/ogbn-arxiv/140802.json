The focus on reward functions and state-initialization suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The mention of viability kernels and failure suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of vision-based tasks in the experiments suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
