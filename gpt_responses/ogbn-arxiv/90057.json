It also mentions dynamic code analysis and signed nested transactions for ensuring valid state changes, which can be considered security measures. \n\n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper deals with crosschain transactions, which involve multiple blockchains and require coordination between them. This falls under the domain of distributed computing. \n\n3. cs.Distributed (Distributed Computing): Similar to the above, the paper deals with distributed systems and the challenges of coordinating transactions across multiple blockchains. \n\n4. cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the use of Coordination Contracts and Dynamic code analysis for managing the state of crosschain transactions and ensuring valid state changes. This can be considered a programming language-related topic. \n\n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses various techniques for ensuring atomicity and validity of crosschain transactions, which can be considered software engineering challenges."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
