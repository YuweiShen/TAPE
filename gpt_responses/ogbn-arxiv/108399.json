The paper specifically evaluates the performance of multilingual BERT models on Finnish language tasks, which relates to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also introduces a new Finnish BERT model trained from scratch, which could be relevant to neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) and cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
