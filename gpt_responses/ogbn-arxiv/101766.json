Additionally, the paper discusses the use of this object detection for robotic perception systems, which falls under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The paper also presents a theoretical framework and verification tests, which involve machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The use of these techniques to improve the accuracy of object detection can be considered a form of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the reliability and security of the detection system, which can be considered a form of computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
