The method aims to minimize complexity and computational cost, which is relevant to optimization and efficiency in neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also mentions the use of neural networks in computer vision applications, which falls under the computer vision sub-category (cs.CV). Finally, the paper presents numerical experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which involves data analysis and experimentation, falling under the data science sub-category (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
