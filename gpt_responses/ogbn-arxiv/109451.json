The specific problem being addressed is the quadratic Gaussian multiple description coding, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also introduces a new encoding scheme based on combinatorial message sharing, which involves combinatorial optimization techniques (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses achievable rate-distortion regions, which is a topic in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
