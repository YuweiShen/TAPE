The method proposed involves constrained optimization and fine-tuning of the network, which falls under the category of optimization and learning algorithms (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the application of the method to image classification tasks, which is a common application of neural networks in computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper involves the use of Lagrangian multipliers, which is a common technique in optimization and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves the use of automatic control over the rate of tapering, which falls under the category of adaptive systems and reinforcement learning (cs.AI, cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
