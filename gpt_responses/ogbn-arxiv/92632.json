It also presents a typology of current models of computation and indicates future paths for the advancement of the field. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.ET (Emerging Technologies), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) as they deal with the fundamental nature of computation and its models. The paper also discusses the application of computation in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE), making them the fourth and fifth likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
