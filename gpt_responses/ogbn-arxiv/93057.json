Additionally, the use of convolutional neural networks and multi-stage training strategies suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper may also be relevant to the medical imaging (cs.MS) sub-category due to its application in lung segmentation for medical diagnosis. Finally, the use of atrous convolutional layers and network-wise training may suggest that the paper could also belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
