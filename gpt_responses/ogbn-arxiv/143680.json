This involves building a control model during consecutive process executions under optimal control via reinforcement learning, using the measured product quality as reward after each process execution. The paper also mentions that the proposed algorithm takes stochastic variations of the process conditions into account and is able to cope with partial observability. Based on these aspects, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
