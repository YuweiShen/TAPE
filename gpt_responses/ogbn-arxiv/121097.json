The paper proposes a framework for learning fair representations that are statistically indistinguishable between protected groups while preserving other information for classification. This work involves developing a minimax adversarial framework with a generator and a critic. The paper also provides a theoretical guarantee with respect to statistical parity and individual fairness. Given the focus on machine learning and fairness, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.CY (Computers and Society), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
