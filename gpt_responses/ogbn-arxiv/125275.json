The paper also discusses the training difficulties of VAEs, which could fall under categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper proposes a new scheduling scheme for training VAEs, which could also be relevant to categories such as cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
