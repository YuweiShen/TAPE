The use of abstract interpretation and labelling functions also suggests a connection to logic and constraint programming (cs.LO), as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of unification, which is a fundamental operation in formal language theory and automata (cs.FL). Finally, the paper discusses the generalization of previous works, which suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE) and the development of reusable techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
