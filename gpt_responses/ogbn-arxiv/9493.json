The use of eigenvectors and eigenvalue distribution is also a common technique in these fields. The paper also discusses the characterization of submatrices of the DFT matrix, which falls under numerical analysis (cs.NA) and linear algebra (cs.LG). Finally, the paper's focus on time-frequency limiting operators and periodic discrete prolate spheroidal sequences suggests that it may also be relevant to the subfield of spectral analysis (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
