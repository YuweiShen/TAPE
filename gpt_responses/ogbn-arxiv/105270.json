However, comparing models in a real-world environment for the purposes of early stopping or hyperparameter tuning is costly and often practically infeasible. This leads the authors to examine off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) in such settings. The paper focuses on OPE for value-based methods, which are of particular interest in deep RL, with applications like robotics, where off-policy algorithms based on Q-function estimation can often attain better sample complexity than direct policy optimization. The paper proposes an alternative metric that relies on neither models nor importance sampling (IS), by framing OPE as a positive-unlabeled (PU) classification problem with the Q-function as the decision function. The paper experiments with this metric on a number of tasks, including the transfer to the real-world of policies trained in simulation for an image-based robotic manipulation task. Based on this analysis, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
