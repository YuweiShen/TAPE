The paper also discusses reducing the cost of the neural network, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of fewer weight parameters and reducing the energy required for data accesses is related to neural network optimization (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses combining the proposed method with previously proposed network cost reduction methods, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) as it involves combining different techniques to improve image classification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
