The paper also discusses the use of low-precision inference pipelines, which is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper explores the impact of different cluster sizes on performance and accuracy, which is related to computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
