The paper also discusses the use of pre-trained networks and fine-tuning, which are topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve classification, detection, and segmentation, which are tasks commonly associated with multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the layer-wise fine-tuning scheme, which is a technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
