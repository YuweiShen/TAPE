This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), robotics (cs.RO), and systems and control (cs.SY). The focus on image sequences and the use of a global encoder also suggest a strong possibility for cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
