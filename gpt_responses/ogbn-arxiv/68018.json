This falls under the domain of computer vision and pattern recognition.\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper proposes a novel multi-scale wavelet domain residual learning architecture for CT image reconstruction. This involves the use of information theory concepts such as wavelet transforms and residual learning.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The proposed method involves the use of deep learning techniques such as residual learning to compensate for the artifacts in limited angle CT images. This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with image reconstruction from limited angle CT data, which is a multimedia application.\n5. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) - The paper proposes a novel method for CT image reconstruction from limited angle data, which involves numerical analysis techniques such as wavelet transforms and iterative methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
