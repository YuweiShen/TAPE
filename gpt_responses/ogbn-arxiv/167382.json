This involves analyzing the workflow of the intervention online and automatically predicting the remaining duration. The paper uses a diverse range of sensors in the operating room, making it relevant to the fields of computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), human-computer interaction (cs.HC), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
