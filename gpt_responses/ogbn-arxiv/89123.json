The use of Siamese networks for tracking also suggests a focus on deep learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Additionally, the paper discusses the computational efficiency and hardware/software co-design of the approach, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
