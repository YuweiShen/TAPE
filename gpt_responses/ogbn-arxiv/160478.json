The proposed methods involve regularization techniques and data augmentation, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the challenges faced by recognition systems in the wild, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper proposes techniques to improve the effectiveness of convolutional networks, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
