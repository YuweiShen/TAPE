The paper proposes a self-training approach for unsupervised domain adaptation, which involves re-training an existing object detector using unlabeled data from a new target domain. This involves using a modified knowledge distillation loss, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves using a tracker to acquire hard examples, which is a common technique in computer vision and machine learning (cs.AI, cs.MM). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on challenging face and pedestrian detection tasks, which are common applications of object detection in robotics and autonomous systems (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
