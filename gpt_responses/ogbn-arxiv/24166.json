This involves the use of clustering algorithms to identify suitable abstractions aligned to the underlying structure. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers papers on the development of algorithms and models for machine learning. The paper introduces a framework for automated skill acquisition in reinforcement learning, which involves the use of clustering algorithms to identify suitable abstractions aligned to the underlying structure. This is a machine learning problem, and hence the paper is likely to belong to this sub-category. \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers papers on the development of intelligent agents and systems. The paper introduces a framework for automated skill acquisition in reinforcement learning, which involves the identification of hierarchical structures in the task and the definition of skills in terms of the sequence of actions that lead to transitions between abstract states. This is related to the development of intelligent agents and systems, and hence the paper is likely to belong to this sub-category. \n\n- cs.RO (Robotics): This sub-category covers papers on the development of algorithms and systems for robotics. The paper introduces a framework for automated skill acquisition in reinforcement learning, which can be applied to robotics tasks"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
