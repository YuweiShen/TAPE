The paper specifically addresses the challenges of non-convex optimization and adapting the depth of the network in an online setting. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) since deep learning is widely used in these areas. The paper also mentions the use of Hedge Backpropagation, which is a variant of backpropagation, so cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with learning from a sequence of data, which is related to online algorithms, so cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
