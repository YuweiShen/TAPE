The proposed method involves incorporating epipolar constraints to make the learning more geometrically sound, which involves optimization and machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of Nist'er's Five Point Algorithm, which is a popular method in computer graphics and geometry (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
