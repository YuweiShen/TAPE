The specific scenarios mentioned, such as jamming attacks in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on the Internet, fall under the categories of networked systems (cs.NI) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also uses game-theoretic concepts to analyze the problem, which is related to the field of algorithmic game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
