This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.\n2. cs.LG - The paper proposes a learning architecture that corrects against non-Markovity by running a deterministic factored Finite State Model, which can be learned. This involves machine learning techniques and falls under the domain of machine learning.\n3. cs.RO - The paper discusses the properties of the architecture from the point of view of individual and social learning. This involves the study of multi-agent systems and falls under the domain of robotics.\n4. cs.SY - The paper proposes a learning architecture for a decision-making agent. This involves the study of control systems and falls under the domain of systems and control.\n5. cs.DS - The paper discusses the use of combinatorial policy optimization to develop efficient behaviors.
