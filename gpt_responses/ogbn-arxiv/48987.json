This involves preprocessing of ECG data, training of DNN models with a novel structure, and building an ensemble model for prediction. The paper involves machine learning techniques and computer vision for analyzing ECG data, which suggests that it could belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers papers related to machine learning techniques, which is the main focus of this paper. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category covers papers related to computer vision, which is also relevant to this paper as it involves analyzing ECG data. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers papers related to artificial intelligence, which is relevant to this paper as it involves developing an algorithm for automatic detection of ECG abnormalities. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category covers papers related to neural networks, which is relevant to this paper as it involves training DNN models. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): This sub-category covers papers related to human-computer interaction, which is less likely but still possible as the paper involves developing an algorithm for diagnosing heart diseases, which could have implications for healthcare and patient interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
