The use of existential rules and Datalog+/- also suggests a connection to logic and knowledge representation. Therefore, cs.DB and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions decidability and finite controllability, which are topics in computational complexity and algorithms, making cs.CC a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper introduces a general technique for (dis)proving finite controllability of ontological fragments, which could be relevant to data structures and algorithms, placing the paper in the sub-categories cs.DS and cs.LO."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
