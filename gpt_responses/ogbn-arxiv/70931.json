The toolkit enables the development of learning environments which are rich in sensory and physical complexity, provide compelling cognitive challenges, and support dynamic multi-agent interaction. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the development of a new toolkit for creating learning environments for intelligent agents, which suggests that it is likely to belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning in the development of the toolkit, which suggests that it is likely to belong to this sub-category as well. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the use of the toolkit in the context of Robotics, which suggests that it is likely to belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper mentions the use of Unity as a simulation platform, which suggests that it is likely to belong to this sub-category as well. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the development of a new toolkit for creating simulation environments, which suggests that it is likely to belong to this sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
