Additionally, the paper discusses the use of stronger supervisory signals and human-derived attention maps, which could also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also mentions human psychophysics and the interpretability of visual features, which could be relevant to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category.
