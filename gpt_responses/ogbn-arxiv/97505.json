The paper also proposes a new algorithm that leverages the behavior of nearby human drivers, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also conducts a user study to assess people's attitudes towards socially cohesive cars, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
