The specific application domain of language models and text generation suggests that the paper could also be classified under \"Computation and Language\" (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper proposes a new method for learning parametric monotonic functions, which could be relevant to the sub-categories of \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI) and \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE). Finally, the paper includes experiments with language models, which could also place it under \"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\" (cs.CV) as language models are often used in natural language processing tasks such as image captioning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
