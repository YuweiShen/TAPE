The paper proposes an extension to the Links web programming language to support relational lenses, which are a form of view update. This involves typechecking and higher-order predicates, which are topics in programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also discusses the implementation of a curation interface for a scientific database application, which falls under software engineering (cs.SE). The paper includes a proof of soundness, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the design of a language feature, which is a topic in cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
