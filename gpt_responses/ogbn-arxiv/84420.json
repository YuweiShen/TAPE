The paper also discusses the use of binary and high-order modulations, which falls under the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The comparison with classical error-correction coding schemes suggests a focus on coding theory (cs.CC), and the mention of performance tradeoffs suggests a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
