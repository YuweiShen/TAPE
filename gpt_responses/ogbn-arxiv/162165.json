The use of real-time algorithms and optimization techniques suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The comparison with existing approaches and the use of a high fidelity model suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
