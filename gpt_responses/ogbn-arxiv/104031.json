The proposed scheme uses a mixed integer programming technique to optimize the charging behavior of different types of EVs, which can be considered as a control problem. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a different charging scheme for each type of EV, which is adopted by the charging station to encourage more EVs to be green. This can be seen as an AI-based approach to optimize the charging behavior of EVs. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses real solar and pricing data for performance analysis of the system. Machine learning techniques can be used to analyze and predict the behavior of EVs and PV generation, which can be useful for optimizing the charging station's operation. \n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper proposes a novel approach to minimize the cost of energy trading in a PV-powered charging station by classifying EVs into different categories based on their charging behavior. This can be considered as an emerging technology in the field of sustainable transportation. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper uses a mixed integer programming technique to optimize the charging behavior of different types of EVs in a PV-powered charging station.
