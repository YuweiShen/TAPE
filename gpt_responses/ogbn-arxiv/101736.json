The paper proposes a resource orchestration framework for network slicing systems to guarantee reliable bursty URLLC service provision, which involves the optimization of physical resource blocks (PRBs) and coordinated multipoint (CoMP) beamforming. The paper also investigates the multiplexing of URLLC and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services, which is a relevant topic in the field of multimedia communication and network optimization. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.MM (Multimedia), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
