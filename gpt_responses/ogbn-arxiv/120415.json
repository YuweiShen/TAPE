The paper also mentions a sampling method, which could fall under the category of computational statistics (cs.CR) or statistical inference (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of the framework for various evidence rules, which could be related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
