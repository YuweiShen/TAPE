The paper also mentions the SyGuS input format, which is built on top of SMT-LIB, a language for specifying logical formulas.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the Syntax-Guided Synthesis competition, which aims to evaluate different synthesis techniques on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. This involves the development of efficient solvers for SyGuS, which can be seen as a programming language problem.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents and analyzes the results of the SyGuS competition, which is an effort to facilitate and accelerate research and development of efficient solvers for SyGuS. This involves software engineering techniques for developing and evaluating solvers.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with a computational problem of finding an implementation that meets both a semantic constraint given by a logical formula and a syntactic constraint given by a grammar. This can be seen as an AI problem of automated program synthesis.\n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper discusses the SyGuS input format, which is built on top of SMT-LIB, a language for specifying"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
