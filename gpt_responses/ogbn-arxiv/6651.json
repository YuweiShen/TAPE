The paper also involves graph-theoretic properties of the information feedback structure, which falls under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the experts and multi-armed bandits settings, which are classic problems in game theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper involves information theory, which is a subfield of computer science that deals with the quantification, storage, and communication of information (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
