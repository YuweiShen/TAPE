The proposed approach involves taking advantage of properties in the frequency domain, which suggests a potential connection to information theory (cs.IT). The use of different priors and regularizations also suggests a potential connection to machine learning (cs.MM, cs.LG, cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
