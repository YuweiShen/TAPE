Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of multilevel coding and modulation, which are techniques commonly used in signal processing and communication systems, making cs.SI (Signal Processing) a likely sub-category as well. The paper also discusses the construction of polar codes over fading channels, which is a topic related to networked systems and wireless communication, making cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves simulations over the MIMO channel, which is a topic related to multimedia systems and applications, making cs.MM (Multimedia) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
