It also involves the use of machine learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The proposed method involves active collaboration between classifiers, which could be related to the Robotics (cs.RO) category. Finally, the paper deals with real-world online tracking, which could also suggest that it belongs to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
