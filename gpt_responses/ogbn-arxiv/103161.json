The paper also applies the method to a radial basis function (RBF) mapping with a linear support vector machine (SVM), which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. Additionally, the paper discusses the interplay between the DR mapping, the number of latent dimensions, and the number of classes, which could fall under the categories of neural networks (cs.NE) and systems and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
