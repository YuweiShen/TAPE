The methodology involves ingesting customer and article data, optimizing a global set of parameters, and mapping additional customer and article attributes into a latent space to derive personalized recommendations. This involves techniques from machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), information retrieval (cs.IR), natural language processing (cs.CL), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
