The main focus is on minimizing space overhead while achieving fast query times. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category. Additionally, the paper utilizes techniques from information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR) to achieve its results. The use of random matrices and hash functions also suggests a connection to the Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of hash tables and probing schemes, which are topics typically covered in the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
