It also involves the use of confidence scores to improve robustness, which is a common theme in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper also discusses attacks on the trained models, which falls under the computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the use of neural networks for adversarial training suggests that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
