The paper proposes a new algorithm for handling general pairwise terms, which is evaluated on various benchmark labeling problems such as stereo, image segmentation, image stitching, and image denoising. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
