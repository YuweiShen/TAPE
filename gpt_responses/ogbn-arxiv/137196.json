Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses encoding and decoding complexities, which falls under cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The use of quasigroup and Abelian group structures suggests a possible connection to algebraic coding theory, which falls under cs.SI (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses the preservation of capacity regions, which could fall under cs.DS (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) or cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
