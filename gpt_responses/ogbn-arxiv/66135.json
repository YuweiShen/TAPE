The paper also proposes a novel neural network architecture for this task, which involves feature separation and contextual reasoning, indicating a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI, cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of stripe convolution, which is a technique commonly used in robotics and control systems (cs.RO). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of occlusion, which is a common issue in computer graphics and computer vision (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
