This involves using a recursive Partial Least Squares based adaptive learning model to deal with continuously generated security events. The paper also discusses the challenges and ways in which the model could be operationalized in centralized versus decentralized, and real-time versus batch processing modes. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SE (Software Engineering), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
