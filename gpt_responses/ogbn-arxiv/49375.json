The use of polymorphisms and set operations suggests that the paper may belong to the categories of data structures (cs.DS), computational complexity (cs.CC), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The mention of decision problems and the use of algorithms suggest that the paper may also belong to the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and logic in computer science (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
