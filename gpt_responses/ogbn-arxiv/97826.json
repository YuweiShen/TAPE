The paper proposes a novel algorithm that synthesizes visual features for unseen objects, which involves incorporating unseen object detection into existing training algorithms, making it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses precision/recall tradeoffs, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed scheme on two popular datasets, Pascal VOC and MSCOCO, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
