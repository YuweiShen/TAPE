The proposed model employs dense visual-semantic matching and hierarchical attentions to accurately retrieve and ground images. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed framework involves both image retrieval and rendering, which requires AI techniques such as deep learning and natural language processing. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the creation of multimedia content, specifically storyboards that contain both text and images. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed framework involves deep learning techniques such as hierarchical attentions and dense visual-semantic matching. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves the retrieval of relevant images based on the textual input, which is a classic problem in information retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
