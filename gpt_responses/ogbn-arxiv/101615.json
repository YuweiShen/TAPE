The paper also discusses the different network structures and input image preprocessing methods, which are related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper aims to improve human-computer interaction by recognizing facial expressions, which falls under human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
