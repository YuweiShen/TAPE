These topics are all related to the problem of interpolating a discrete bandlimited signal using an orthogonal basis. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category deals with the study of information processing, including coding, compression, and signal processing. The paper's focus on discrete sampling and interpolation for bandlimited signals makes it a likely fit for this sub-category. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category deals with the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures. The paper's focus on finding unitary submatrices of the discrete Fourier transform matrix suggests that it may be relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms and data structures for geometric problems. The paper's focus on tiling Z_N and maximal cliques suggests that it may be relevant to this sub-category. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms for solving mathematical problems, including interpolation and approximation.
