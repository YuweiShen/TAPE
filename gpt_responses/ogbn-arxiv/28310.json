This involves statistical inference and optimization, which are common themes in the Information Theory (cs.IT), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of regularization techniques to improve the accuracy of the estimates, which is a topic of interest in the Statistics (cs.ST) and Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
