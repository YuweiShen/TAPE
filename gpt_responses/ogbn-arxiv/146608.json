The paper also discusses the trade-off between storage and recreation of dataset versions, which is a problem in data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The proposed heuristics draw from techniques in delay-constrained scheduling (cs.LG), and spanning tree literature (cs.IR), indicating that the paper may also belong to these sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a prototype version management system, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
