The paper proposes a method to generate coherent text using reinforcement learning and neural rewards, which is a common approach in NLP research. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). \n\nThe paper also involves the use of neural networks to learn rewards, which falls under the Artificial Intelligence (AI) sub-category. Therefore, cs.AI is also a likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques to train the model, which falls under the Machine Learning (LG) sub-category. Therefore, cs.LG is also a likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of neural networks to generate text, which falls under the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (NE) sub-category. Therefore, cs.NE is also a likely sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper involves the use of discourse structure to guide text generation, which falls under the Software Engineering (SD) sub-category. Therefore, cs.SD is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
