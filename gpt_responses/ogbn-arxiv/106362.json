The paper also discusses techniques for improving the scalability of the analysis, which involves abstract interpretation (cs.LO), symbolic execution (cs.PL), and software engineering (cs.SE) techniques. Finally, the paper uses probabilistic polyhedra to model the leakage, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
