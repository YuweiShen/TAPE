It also involves robotics (cs.RO) as camera motion estimation is a crucial aspect of the problem. Machine learning (cs.LG) is also relevant as some of the techniques discussed involve learning-based approaches. Graphics (cs.GR) is another possible sub-category as the paper deals with the creation of 3D models from images. Multimedia (cs.MM) is also relevant as the paper discusses various sources of data and software for SfM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
