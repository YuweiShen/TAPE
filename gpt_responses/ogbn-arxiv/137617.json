Therefore, cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the construction of a deterministic automaton, which falls under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the use of marking positions in the regular expression suggests a connection to cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Finally, the paper's focus on the effectiveness of combining different techniques suggests a connection to cs.THEORY (Theoretical Computer Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
