The use of a regularizer for sparsity and the $\\beta$-divergence as the loss function also suggests that it could belong to the information theory (cs.IT) or numerical analysis (cs.NA) categories. Finally, the paper provides update rules for the algorithm, which could also make it relevant to the signal processing (cs.SI) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
