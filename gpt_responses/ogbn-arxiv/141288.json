Specifically, it discusses the relationship between abstract machines for lambda-calculi and sequent calculus, and introduces a syntactic kit expressing the duality of computation. It also describes a proof search discipline and a game of patterns and counterpatterns. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), followed by cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SE (Software Engineering), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
