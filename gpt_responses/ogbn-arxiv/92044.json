The paper also addresses the issue of presentation attacks, which is a sub-topic in computer security (cs.CR). The proposed framework employs deep learning, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). The use of unsupervised adversarial invariance also suggests a potential connection to adversarial machine learning (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
