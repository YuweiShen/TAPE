The paper also discusses the structural advantages of the proposed joints, which could be relevant to mechanical engineering (cs.ME) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the compliance of the joints, which is a key aspect of robotics (cs.ROB). Finally, the paper is inspired by biological systems, which could make it relevant to the field of bioinformatics (cs.BIO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
