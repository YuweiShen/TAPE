The problem is known to be computationally hard and has been the subject of recent research. The paper proposes an approach to approximate the problem by translating it to the model checking of alternating epistemic mu-calculus, which has a lower computational complexity. This work involves logic, artificial intelligence, game theory, and distributed systems, which are all relevant sub-categories of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), cs.DS (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), and cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
