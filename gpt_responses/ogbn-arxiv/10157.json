The proposed method uses particle swarm optimization (PSO) to search for optimal CNN architectures, which is a type of evolutionary computation and thus falls under the neural networks (cs.NE) domain. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of transfer learning, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NE, cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
