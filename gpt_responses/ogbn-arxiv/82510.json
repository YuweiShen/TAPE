This involves sentiment analysis and topic modeling, which are common techniques in natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper focuses on social media-based digital epidemiology, which involves using social media data to support faster response and deeper understanding of public health-related threats. The study collects 6 million tweets for one month to identify the prominent topics of users as it relates to negative sentiments. This involves analyzing the social network of Twitter users and their interactions around DDEO-related issues. \n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a new framework for analyzing unstructured health-related textual data via Twitter users' posts (tweets) to characterize negative health sentiments and non-health related concerns in relation to DDEO. This involves developing software tools and algorithms for sentiment analysis and topic modeling, as well as data collection and preprocessing. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper addresses a societal issue related to public health and well-being, specifically the negative sentiments and concerns around DDEO.
