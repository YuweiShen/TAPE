Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel approach that extends Word2Vec and Doc2Vec, which are popular models in machine learning and deep learning. Hence, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper uses the $k$-nearest neighbor search, which is a common technique in deep learning and neural networks, suggesting that cs.DL (Deep Learning) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
