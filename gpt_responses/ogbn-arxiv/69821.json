The paper proposes a novel approach to ensure sender unobservability when submitting disclosures through an online advertising network, which requires the use of cryptographic techniques and efficient back-end design. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CR, followed by cs.DC and cs.CY. The paper also involves some aspects of software engineering and programming languages, as it describes the implementation and evaluation of the AdLeaks system, which could be classified under cs.SE and cs.PL, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
