This task is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the proposed method involves dynamic modulation of convolution operations, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the experiments are conducted on public datasets related to video analysis (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
