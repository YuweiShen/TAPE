The use of magnetoencephalography and functional MRI also suggests a neuroscientific approach to computer vision. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories as it involves the use of a deep neural network and training on real-world categorization. The paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it involves the development of an algorithmic approach to understanding human visual processing. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the neural information processing (cs.NI) sub-category as it involves the investigation of spatio-temporal dynamics in the human visual brain."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
