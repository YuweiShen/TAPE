The approach involves training simple fully connected networks as reactive behaviours, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of an Actor-Critic architecture also suggests a focus on control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of the approach in terms of reducing the number of training episodes required, which is a common concern in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
