It also involves the transmission of bits with a certain error rate, which is related to error-correcting codes (cs.CC). The paper may also be relevant to network information theory (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper may involve computational complexity theory (cs.DS) in terms of determining the maximum number of bits that can be transmitted with a given error rate."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
