The paper also discusses the use of different techniques to improve the performance of the models, such as dropout and batch normalization, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of GPU computation to expedite the training process, which is a technique commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) applications. Finally, the paper discusses the visualization of different layers of a network to show what features of a face can be learned by CNN models, which is related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
