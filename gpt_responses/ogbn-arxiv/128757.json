The use of multiple policies and the storage of these policies in a map is a novel approach that involves machine learning techniques such as Bayesian optimization and multi-dimensional discrete maps, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of visual inputs to train the robot, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper deals with the control of robots, which is a topic in systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
