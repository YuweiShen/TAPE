This involves the use of color probabilities and Gaussian mixture model for forming an ear skin color model, which is then used for color similarity comparison between a pair of reference model and probe ear images. The paper also involves the segmentation of ear images in some color slice regions, followed by the extraction of SIFT keypoints and the creation of an augmented vector of extracted SIFT features for matching. Based on these aspects, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), multimedia (cs.MM), information retrieval (cs.IR), cryptography and security (cs.CR), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
