The paper proposes a novel deep network architecture for person re-identification, which involves learning joint representations in a multiplicative way and performing spatially recurrent pooling. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), multimedia (cs.MM), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and cryptography and security (cs.CR) as these fields are closely related to computer vision and deep learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
