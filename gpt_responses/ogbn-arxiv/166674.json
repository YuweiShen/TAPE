The paper discusses the trade-offs between model complexity and performance and provides guidance for architecture design. The paper also validates the proposed framework on a series of monitoring experiments. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the paper deals with machine learning models and their performance. Additionally, cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) are also likely as the paper discusses the safety requirement for the local monitoring function and the need for secure communication between the edge device and the server."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
