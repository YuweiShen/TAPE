Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the performance of pre-trained QA methods, which suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the retrieval problem in a multi-hop setting, which suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
