Additionally, the paper mentions experiments on two TREC ad hoc search datasets, which are commonly used in information retrieval research. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category, as it specifically mentions improving ad hoc search accuracy. \n\nThe use of distributed representations and kernels suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. \n\nThe paper's focus on modeling entity salience and interactions between entities and words suggests that it could be relevant to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper's use of end-to-end learning and its potential for improving search accuracy suggests that it could be relevant to the cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
