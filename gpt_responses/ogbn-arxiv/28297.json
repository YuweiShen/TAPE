The authors use a binarized neural network to approximate a PDE solver, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of decision procedures to tackle the problem is also a common topic in computer science (cs.SY). Finally, the problem of generating images with given properties can also be related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
