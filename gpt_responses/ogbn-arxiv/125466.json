The paper also discusses the evolution of empirical practice in computer vision and AI, which suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper examines the performance of both classic and deep learning algorithms under various camera settings, which suggests that it may belong to the signal processing (cs.SD) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
