The use of Kullback-Leibler divergence and generalized likelihood-ratio test (GLRT) also suggests a connection to information theory and statistics. The paper also mentions applications involving large alphabet distributions, which could be related to data structures (cs.DS) or multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of the term \"mismatched divergence\" suggests a possible connection to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
