The paper proposes coordinate descent algorithms for solving the nonconvex optimization problem of phase retrieval. Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms, which suggests that cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) is another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a novel application of the coordinate descent algorithms in digital communications, which suggests that cs.SI (Signal Processing) is another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
