Therefore, cs.SP (Signal Processing) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are likely sub-categories. The paper also introduces analogues of restricted isometry and null space properties for the recovery of partially sparse vectors, which are important concepts in Compressed Sensing. Hence, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SI (Systems and Control) are also possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses how to extend recovery under noisy measurements to the partially sparse case, which involves numerical optimization techniques, making cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) a plausible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
