Additionally, the use of deep neural networks for learning pose-augmented relation representations and the evaluation on public benchmarks are common in the computer vision literature. The paper also involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques for reasoning about human-object interactions. The use of multi-level feature networks and attention mechanisms are common in machine learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also involves robotics (cs.RO) as it deals with understanding human-object interactions in complex scenes, which is relevant to robotics applications. Finally, the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as it deals with visual information processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
