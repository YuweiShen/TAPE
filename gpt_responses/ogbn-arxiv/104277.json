The use of reinforcement learning to adaptively choose the compression level suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also discusses the challenges of designing JPEG configuration for different deep learning cloud services, which could be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the proposed approach on popular computer vision services such as Amazon Rekognition, Face++, and Baidu Vision suggests a multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper also considers the impact of data size on accuracy, which could be categorized under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
