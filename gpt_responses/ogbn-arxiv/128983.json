Additionally, the paper may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it involves rendering new frames from different viewpoints. The multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper deals with video processing. The robotics (cs.RO) sub-category is another possibility as the paper involves camera arrays and camera motion. Finally, the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category is a less likely possibility as the paper does not explicitly mention the use of neural networks or evolutionary algorithms, but these techniques could potentially be used in the view synthesis algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
