This is a common task in information retrieval (IR) and digital libraries (DL), which are subfields of computer science (CS). The paper also mentions using a database with real-world papers from DBLP, which is a digital library for computer science. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval), followed by cs.DL (Digital Libraries), cs.DB (Databases), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
