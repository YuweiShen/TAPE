The paper also presents a human-robot trust model, which involves machine learning and cognitive science aspects (cs.AI, cs.HC). The use of symbolic motion planning (SMP) is also mentioned, which falls under the category of planning and scheduling (cs.SY). Finally, the paper involves optimization techniques for task allocation, which can be categorized under mathematical optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
