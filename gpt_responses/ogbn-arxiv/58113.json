The paper's focus on locally testable codes suggests that it may be more closely related to cs.IT and cs.DS, but the use of Cayley graphs and their properties also makes cs.CG and cs.DM possible categories. The paper's emphasis on algebraic structures and graph theory also suggests cs.CC as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
