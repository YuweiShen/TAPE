This falls under the intersection of computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO), as well as machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for the deep learning aspect. The use of a controller also suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
