Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves data storage and retrieval, which falls under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The use of coding to improve performance is a control theory problem, which is covered by cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper involves cost analysis, which is a topic in cs.PF (Performance)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
