The technique involves beamforming, which is a common topic in communication systems (cs.COMM) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also proposes criteria for designing the constellation precoder, which involves optimization and design, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
