The paper also formally establishes the security guarantees of the proposed system. \n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The proposed system, HCAP, is designed for a distributed authorization environment, which falls under the scope of this sub-category. \n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a system for enforcing permission sequencing constraints, which is a software engineering problem. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with controlling access to IoT devices based on their physical positions, which can be seen as a systems and control problem. \n5. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the sensitive nature of permissions in IoT applications and the need for further constraints, which falls under the scope of this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
