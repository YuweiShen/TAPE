Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques for quality estimation, which suggests that it could also be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of metrics such as BLEU and METEOR, which are commonly used in information retrieval (IR) and natural language generation (NE) tasks, respectively. Therefore, cs.IR and cs.NE are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
