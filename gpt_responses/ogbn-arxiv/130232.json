Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses theoretical bounds and trade-offs, which suggests that it could belong to cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the use of millimeter wave technology indicates that it could be categorized under cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
