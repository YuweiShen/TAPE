The paper proposes a new framework called Recursive Optimal Transport (ROT) to incorporate structural information with classic optimal transport (OT) for sentence similarity. This paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category covers topics related to NLP, including text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and information retrieval. The paper's focus on measuring sentence similarity falls under this sub-category. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers topics related to machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. The paper's use of ROT and ROTS for sentence similarity may fall under this sub-category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers topics related to AI, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. The paper's focus on NLP and sentence similarity may fall under this sub-category. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category covers topics related to computer vision, including image and video analysis, object recognition, and scene understanding. Although the paper is not directly related to computer vision, the use of OT and ROT may have applications in this field. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
