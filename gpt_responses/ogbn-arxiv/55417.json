This is a core topic in networking and internet architecture.\n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper deals with a distributed protocol for broadcasting messages in a network, which is a core topic in distributed computing.\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes an efficient algorithm for scheduling a broadcast along a BFS tree under the affectance model, which is a core topic in data structures and algorithms.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper deals with the affectance model, which parameterizes the interference that other nodes introduce in the communication between a given pair of nodes. This is a core topic in social and information networks.\n5. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper proposes a performance metric for the Multiple-Message Broadcast problem, which is the ratio of the throughput of such protocol against the optimal one, for any sufficiently long period of time since startup. This is a core topic in information theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
