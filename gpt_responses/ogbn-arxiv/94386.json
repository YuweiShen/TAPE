The paper presents an algorithm that improves upon the naive $O(m)$-time algorithm for exact weighted APSP, which suggests that the paper is likely to be in the area of distributed computing (cs.DC) or distributed systems (cs.DS). The problem of computing all-pairs shortest paths also has applications in network infrastructure (cs.NI) and social networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents an algorithmic improvement for a related problem, the $k$-source shortest paths problem, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the algorithms (cs.AL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
