The use of optimal control theory and the formulation of an optimization problem suggest that the paper could also belong to the sub-category of Control Engineering (cs.CE). The consideration of time-varying spreading rates and the use of mathematical models for epidemics suggest that the paper could also belong to the sub-categories of Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Mathematical Analysis (cs.MA). Finally, the use of heuristic control strategies and the analysis of the sensitivity of the optimal control to the spreading rate profile suggest that the paper could also belong to the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
