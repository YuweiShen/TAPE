The paper focuses on the computational approaches used to achieve strong scaling on both commodity clusters and Top100-supercomputers, without relying on architecture-specific features or specialized accelerator hardware. The paper does not discuss any specific application domain, but rather focuses on the computational approaches used to achieve strong scaling. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.MS (Mathematical Software)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
