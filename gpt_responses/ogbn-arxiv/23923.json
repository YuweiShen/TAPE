The emphasis on learning tractable models suggests a focus on efficient algorithms and data structures, which are also relevant to data structures (cs.DS). The use of graphical models and algorithms for inference suggest a connection to natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
