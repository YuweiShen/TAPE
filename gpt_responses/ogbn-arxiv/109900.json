The paper proposes a new algorithm for finding the k-best Bayesian network structures and using Bayesian model averaging to compute posterior probabilities. This work is closely related to topics in machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data mining (cs.DM), statistical inference (cs.SI), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
