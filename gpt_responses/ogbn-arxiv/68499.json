This involves the fusion of 'hard' and 'soft' data originating from machine and human sensors, respectively. The paper also discusses the technical challenge of gathering the most informative data from human sensors without task overloading. The proposed framework uses Value of Information (VOI) as a crucial decision-theoretic metric for scheduling interaction with human sensors. The paper presents a new Deep Learning based VOI estimation framework that can be used to schedule collaborative human-machine sensing with computationally efficient online inference and minimal policy hand-tuning. The framework uses supervised learning to train deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract hierarchical features from 'images' of belief spaces obtained via data fusion. These features can be associated with soft data query choices to reliably compute VOI for human interaction. The paper also demonstrates the practical feasibility of the proposed method on a mobile robotic search problem with language-based semantic human sensor inputs. Based on these factors, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.RO, cs.HC, and cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
