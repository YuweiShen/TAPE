This falls under the domain of FPGA architecture.\n- cs.ET (Embedded Systems): The paper discusses the implementation of a low-power neural-network accelerator and an OpenRISC system-on-chip capable of booting Linux on the FPGA platform. This falls under the domain of embedded systems.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper mentions the use of Verilog for synthesis, which is a hardware description language used for programming FPGAs. This falls under the domain of programming languages.\n- cs.EM (Emerging Technologies): The paper discusses the use of FPGAs for custom-computing machines and neural-network accelerators, which are emerging technologies in the field of computing.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the implementation of an OpenRISC system-on-chip on the FPGA platform, which falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
