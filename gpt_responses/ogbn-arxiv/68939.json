The dataset is challenging and requires advanced machine learning techniques, which suggests that it could also fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The dataset is related to security and surveillance, which could make it relevant to cryptography and security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of object detection pipelines, which could make it relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
