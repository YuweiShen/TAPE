Specifically, the paper focuses on the framework of federated edge learning (FEEL) and proposes energy-efficient strategies for bandwidth allocation and scheduling. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also discusses radio resource management (RRM) for FEEL, which involves wireless communication and network infrastructure, indicating that it could also belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper proposes optimization strategies for energy-efficient RRM, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper involves the development of learning algorithms, which could also fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
