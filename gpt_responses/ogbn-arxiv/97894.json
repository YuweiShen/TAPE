This involves exploring the unregulated visible light spectrum to enable high-speed communications. The paper proposes a new multiple access technique called rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and investigates its integration with VLC systems. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses communication and networking technologies, which could fall under cs.COMM (Computer Communications and Networks). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of VLC in indoor environments, which could relate to cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.CE (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
