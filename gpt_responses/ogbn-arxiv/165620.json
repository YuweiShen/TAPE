The paper evaluates the proposed method on various sequential problems such as language modeling and question answering, which are typically studied in the natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) communities. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper's focus on improving training speed and generalization suggests that it could also be relevant to the sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
