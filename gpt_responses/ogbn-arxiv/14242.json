This involves joint multimodal training and crossmodal training to explore the underlying semantic emotion information. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with multiple modalities, including audio and visual, to recognize emotions.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper uses visual features to recognize emotions from facial expressions.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a learning framework to improve the performance of an emotion recognition system.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with recognizing emotions from speech signals.\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper aims to improve the performance of an emotion recognition system, which is relevant to human-computer interaction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
