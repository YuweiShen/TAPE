The paper develops novel insights about how to reason about higher order multilinear moments, which is a technique used in many areas of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), data structures (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), computational complexity (cs.CC), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
