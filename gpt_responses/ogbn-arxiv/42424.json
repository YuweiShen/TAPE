Therefore, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel regularization term for training optimization, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the detection of deepfakes, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
