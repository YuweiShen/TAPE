This falls under the category of Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA) and Distributed Systems (cs.DS). The physical constraints on the connections and the use of termination protocols suggest that the paper may also be relevant to Robotics (cs.RO) and Control Systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of algorithms and protocols for constructing shapes and patterns may also make this paper relevant to Computational Geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
