The use of an auxiliary random variable technique suggests a focus on signal processing and coding, which could also fall under cs.NI (networking and internet architecture). The mention of differential modulation schemes suggests a focus on control systems (cs.SY), and the use of lognormal fading channels suggests a focus on modeling and simulation (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
