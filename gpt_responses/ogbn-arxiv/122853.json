The paper also involves the use of 3D models and optimization techniques, which are commonly used in graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed method in generating photorealistic facial images, which could be relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
