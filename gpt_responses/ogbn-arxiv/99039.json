This falls under the domain of robotics.\n- cs.ME (Mechanical Engineering): The paper discusses the mechanical design of the microrobot, including the double-ratcheting mechanism and the continuously rotating wheels. This is a key aspect of mechanical engineering.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): Although not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, the microrobot may have potential applications in the field of neural and evolutionary computing, such as in swarm robotics or artificial intelligence.\n- cs.EM (Electromagnetism): The paper mentions the use of low-voltage electromagnetic actuators to drive the microrobot. This falls under the domain of electromagnetism.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper describes the development of a self-sufficient microrobot that can roll freely for 8 seconds after a single charge. This involves control systems to manage the power consumption and movement of the robot."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
