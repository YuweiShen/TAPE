The paper also employs machine learning algorithms (cs.MM) and statistical analysis (cs.LG) to achieve counting. Additionally, the paper uses multiple cameras to expand the field of view and mitigate occlusion, which is related to robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper employs corner point extraction and learning algorithms, which are also related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
