It also involves the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are commonly used in computer vision. The paper also involves machine learning techniques such as Fisher kernel and deep neural activations, which are relevant to sub-categories such as Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to Multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with image representation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
