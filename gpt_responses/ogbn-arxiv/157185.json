The use of game theory to model the selfish behavior of terminals suggests a connection to game theory (cs.GT) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the study of the impact of source correlations on the performance of the system could be seen as a problem in statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
