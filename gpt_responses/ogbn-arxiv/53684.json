The method involves Non-negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) coupled with a custom clustering procedure based on k-means. This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the application of the method to chemical engineering (cs.CE) and materials science (cs.MS) problems. Additionally, the method can be applied to any observed or simulated datasets that can be represented as tensors, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
