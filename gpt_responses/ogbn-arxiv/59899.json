The use of eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the graph suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-category of spectral analysis (cs.SI). The study of viral spreading also involves the analysis of network structures and their properties, which falls under the sub-categories of network science (cs.NI) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also proposes an analytical condition for designing RGG's to control viral infections, which involves the use of information theory (cs.IT) and systems and control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
