The proposed method involves estimating motion flow using deep neural networks, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of a recurrent neural network, which is commonly used in control and decision-making tasks in robotics (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
