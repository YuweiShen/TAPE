This falls under the domain of game theory, making cs.GT the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses algorithms for computing optimal commitment strategies, which is a common topic in AI research. Additionally, the study of limited lookahead is relevant to AI agents that need to make decisions in real-time with incomplete information.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper's experimental investigation involves studying the impact of noise in estimates and different lookahead depths, which is a common topic in machine learning research.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the hardness of finding Nash equilibria and optimal commitment strategies, which involves analyzing the computational complexity of algorithms. This falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms.\n5. cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics): The paper involves analyzing the structure of game trees and the impact of limited lookahead, which falls under the domain of discrete mathematics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
