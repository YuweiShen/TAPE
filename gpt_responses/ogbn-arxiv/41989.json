It could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as DNNs are commonly used in computer vision tasks. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as DNNs are a popular AI technique. The use of probabilistic data structures suggests it could also be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
