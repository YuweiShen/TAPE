The paper proposes a dual frame-rate system that uses a modulator stream to extract slowly changing features describing the environment and a prediction stream to extract transient signals that describe particularities of the current frame. This paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) category as it deals with video understanding and perception. It is also likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) category as it focuses on autonomous driving vehicles and drones. Additionally, it may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) categories as it proposes a new approach to designing efficient perception systems. Finally, it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) category as it deals with video analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
