The paper also proposes a framework that incorporates user-interface features, which suggests a focus on Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). Additionally, the use of machine learning algorithms for recommendation systems suggests a connection to Deep Learning (cs.DL) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the evaluation of the prototype system with participants suggests a connection to Cybernetics (cs.CY) in terms of studying the interaction between humans and machines."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
