This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) subfield of Computer Science. Specifically, the paper deals with explainable AI techniques for text summarization, which falls under the category of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of machine learning techniques such as LRP, which are commonly used in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the importance of testing the validity of the saliency maps, which is a topic that falls under the category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses the need for careful consideration when accepting saliency maps as explanations, which is a topic that falls under the category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
