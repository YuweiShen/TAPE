The paper also proposes a list decoding algorithm with a cyclic redundancy check, which is a technique used in cryptography (cs.CR). The optimization of the amount of redundancy added is a problem related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The numerical simulations involve statistical analysis and machine learning (cs.SI). Finally, the use of error-correcting codes is a topic related to network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
