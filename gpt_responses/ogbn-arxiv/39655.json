It also involves algebraic coding theory, which falls under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG) and group theory (cs.GT). The paper also discusses the properties of self-dual codes, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the use of Reed-Solomon codes and extended GRS codes suggests a connection to coding theory (cs.DS) and computer communications (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
