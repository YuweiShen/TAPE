The paper proposes a neural network approach for malware detection that does not rely on feature engineering, but rather learns automatically from dynamic analysis reports. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the evaluation of the proposed approach on different datasets, which may suggest that it falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach for learning from dynamic analysis reports, which may suggest that it falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
