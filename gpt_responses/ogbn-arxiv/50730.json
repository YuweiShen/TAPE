This suggests that the paper may belong to the Cryptography and Security sub-category.\n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper deals with incentive mechanisms for crowd sensing applications, which involve distributed computing and data collection. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing sub-category.\n3. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper proposes a novel class of incentive mechanisms for crowd sensing applications, which involves game theory concepts. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Computer Science and Game Theory sub-category.\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper deals with privacy and security challenges in crowd sensing applications, which have social implications. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Computers and Society sub-category.\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with crowd sensing applications, which involve social networks and information sharing.
