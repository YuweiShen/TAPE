This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses reinforcement learning tasks (cs.AI), image classification (cs.CV), and robotics (cs.RO) as examples of tasks that can be performed by the proposed weight-agnostic neural networks. Therefore, these five sub-categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
