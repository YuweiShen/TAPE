The paper also discusses a new receiver architecture called Integer-Forcing (IF) linear receiver, which is a topic related to signal processing (cs.SI) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also presents simulation results, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM) and computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
