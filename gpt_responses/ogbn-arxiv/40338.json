It proposes a solution based on Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs) to dynamically adjust frequency channel, transmit power, and sensitivity threshold. This paper involves concepts related to networking (cs.NI), machine learning (cs.LG), information theory (cs.IT), control systems (cs.SY), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
