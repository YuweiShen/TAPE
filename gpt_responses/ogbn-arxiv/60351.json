The focus on resource-constrained devices and the need for low memory and latency requirements suggest a connection to distributed systems (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the application of the algorithm to servers storing and querying data suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
