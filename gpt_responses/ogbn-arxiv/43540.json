The paper also discusses transfer learning, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a new method for learning the distance metric, which involves sparse combinations of base metrics, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments in the paper involve handwritten image classification and natural image annotation, which are both topics in multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
