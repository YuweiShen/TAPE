This topic is relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including digital libraries (cs.DL), information retrieval (cs.IR), databases (cs.DB), computer engineering (cs.CE), and cryptography and security (cs.CR). However, given the focus on metadata and similarity computation, cs.DL and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.DB, cs.CE, and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
