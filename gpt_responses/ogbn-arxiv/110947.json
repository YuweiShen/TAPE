This problem is closely related to machine learning and privacy, and the paper provides new upper bounds on the private sample complexity in the agnostic PAC model. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as these sub-categories are all relevant to the problem studied in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
