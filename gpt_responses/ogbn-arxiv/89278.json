The use of CVaR as a risk measure is also relevant to game theory. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Markov decision processes are commonly used in AI for decision-making under uncertainty. The paper's focus on designing risk-averse systems is also relevant to AI applications. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper's use of CVaR as a risk measure is relevant to machine learning, particularly in the context of reinforcement learning. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper's focus on designing systems that are robust to risk is relevant to the systems and control subfield. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper's analysis of the computational complexity of decision problems in Markov decision processes is relevant to the data structures and algorithms subfield."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
