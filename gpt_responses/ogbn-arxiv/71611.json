The paper specifically addresses the problem of multi-task linear regression, which is a common problem in several subfields of computer science, including machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and neural networks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
