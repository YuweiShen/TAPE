It also examines the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) used in VoIP, which is a networking protocol (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the potential for high steganographic bandwidth in RTP, which could be considered a multimedia topic (cs.MM). The analysis of real RTP traffic traces involves data analysis and potentially machine learning techniques, which could fall under the categories of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
