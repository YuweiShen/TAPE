The method aims to overcome the challenge of sparse reward in RL, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The method can be applied to both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, which suggests relevance to robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents empirical results on four challenging tasks, indicating relevance to multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
