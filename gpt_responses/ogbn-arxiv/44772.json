Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also involves information retrieval techniques, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another likely category. The use of machine learning models and corpora for training suggests that cs.LG (Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also possible categories. Finally, the paper involves optimization of summarization models, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
