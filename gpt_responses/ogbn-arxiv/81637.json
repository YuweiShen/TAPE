The paper also proposes and compares different heuristic methods for solving this problem, which involves algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) as well as combinatorial optimization and graph theory (cs.DM). The use of heuristics suggests a focus on practical applications, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
