The model uses PPG signals, which are visual signals, and hence, the paper could also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) category. The paper also discusses the use of wearable devices for heart rate monitoring, which could fall under the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) category. The paper also discusses the need for device-specific modeling, which could fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the use of PPG signals for cardiovascular monitoring, which could fall under the biomedical engineering (cs.BIO) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
