It also involves benchmarking on image datasets. \n\nThe paper also involves optimization and learning, which suggests it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. \n\nThe use of alternative foundations for neural networks, such as morphology, could also place this paper in the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper introduces an extension of convolution, which could place it in the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as convolution is commonly used in image and video processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
