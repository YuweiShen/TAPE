The paper presents a mathematical model for implicit bias and proposes a family of simple and interpretable constraints to optimally mitigate it. The paper also provides empirical findings on real-world datasets. Given the focus on machine learning and algorithms, as well as the use of mathematical models and empirical analysis, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CY (Computers and Society), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
