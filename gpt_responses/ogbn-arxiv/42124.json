The paper also proposes a new network architecture, which involves the use of convolutional layers, making it relevant to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of residual-based boundary refinement, which is a technique used in neural networks, making it relevant to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category.
