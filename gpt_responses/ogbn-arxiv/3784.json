The paper proposes strategies to stabilize and improve joint training of energy functions and inference networks for structured prediction. The paper also validates the proposed strategies on two sequence labeling tasks. Given this, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). However, the paper also deals with natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as sequence labeling, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper proposes joint parameterizations for inference networks, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions using global energy terms, which could relate to computer vision tasks and thus cs.CV (Computer Vision) could also be a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with energy-based models, which could relate to cryptography and security, making cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
