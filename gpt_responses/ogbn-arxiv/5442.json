This problem falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and network security (cs.NI). The proposed solutions involve the use of data structures for efficient measurement of connection failure rates, which can be classified under the categories of data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper also discusses the memory efficiency of the proposed solutions, which can be related to the category of systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
