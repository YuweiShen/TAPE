The paper also discusses neural network models, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The authors test their models on different machine learning tasks, including an application to particle physics, which suggests that the paper could also fall under computer vision (cs.CV) or neural engineering (cs.NE). Finally, the paper proposes a new neural network model family, which could also be relevant to the subfield of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
