The use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) also suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of forward models to augment the training data suggests that it may belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the mention of multi-center initiatives and protocol harmonization suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
