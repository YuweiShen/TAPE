Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related tasks. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) and computer vision (CV) techniques to extract information from the structural layout of the documents, which suggests possible sub-categories of cs.IR and cs.CV. The paper also uses deep learning (DL) techniques and evaluates different models, which suggests a possible sub-category of cs.DL. Finally, the paper proposes a new task and datasets for IE, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
