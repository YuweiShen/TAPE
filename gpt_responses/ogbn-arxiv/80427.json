This involves image processing and computer vision techniques, making cs.CV the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper focuses on eye gaze tracking for head mounted virtual reality systems, which is a key aspect of human-computer interaction. The paper also discusses the potential applications of the proposed algorithm in mobile games and virtual reality contents.\n3. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper discusses the use of eye gaze tracking in virtual reality systems, which involves rendering graphics in real-time based on the user's gaze. This makes cs.GR a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of eye gaze tracking in mobile games and virtual reality contents, which are multimedia applications. This makes cs.MM a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.RO (Robotics): Although the paper does not explicitly discuss robotics, the proposed algorithm could potentially be used in robotics applications that require eye gaze tracking, such as human-robot interaction. This makes cs.RO a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
