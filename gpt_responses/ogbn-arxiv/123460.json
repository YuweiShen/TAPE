The paper focuses on mapping the social structure and introducing indicators of socioeconomic status, demographic features, and purchasing habits of individuals. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SOC (Social and Economic Networks). The paper also introduces a correlation network and measures correlations between merchant categories, which suggests that it could belong to cs.CYBER (Cybernetics) and cs.DB (Databases). Finally, the paper analyzes individual consumption histories and detects dynamical patterns in purchase behavior, which suggests that it could belong to cs.MA (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
