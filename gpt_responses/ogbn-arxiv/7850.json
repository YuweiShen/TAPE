The paper uses simulated bibliographic datasets to estimate the accuracy of simple, initials-based methods for disambiguation. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories in computer science, including digital libraries (cs.DL), information retrieval (cs.IR), databases (cs.DB), social and information networks (cs.SI), and computational linguistics (cs.CL). However, given that the paper focuses on bibliographic data and author name disambiguation, cs.DL and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
