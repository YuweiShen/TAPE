Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. Additionally, the paper addresses the problem of transmission scheduling of sensor updates and the restoration of an information flow-line after any real-time update having hard-deadline drops from it, which falls under the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The paper also discusses the minimization of staleness of the time-critical updates to extract maximum utilization out of its information content, which is related to Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. The paper also deals with scheduling policies, which is related to Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses a greedy scheduling policy called Deadline-aware highest latency first, which is related to Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
