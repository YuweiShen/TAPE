The proposed algorithm involves a search process, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG). The experiments involve image reconstruction, which is a topic in computer vision (cs.CV). The use of dynamic cost functions and pruning techniques suggests a numerical analysis aspect (cs.NA). Finally, the paper proposes a new algorithm for signal recovery, which could fall under the signal processing category (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
