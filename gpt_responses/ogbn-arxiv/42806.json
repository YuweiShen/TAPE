The use of a one-bit ADC front end and correlated side information at the receiver suggests that this paper may also fall under the subcategories of signal processing (cs.SP) and machine learning (cs.MM). Additionally, the study of optimal encoder and decoder design for different performance criteria may also relate to the subcategories of statistics (cs.ST) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
