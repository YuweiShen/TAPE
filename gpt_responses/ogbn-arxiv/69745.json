Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is the most likely sub-category. The constant-workspace model is a well-known model in computational geometry, and algorithms in this model are often studied in cs.CG. The paper also involves data structures and algorithms, which are relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The experimental evaluation of the algorithms involves measuring running times and comparing them to theoretical guarantees, which is a topic in cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). The problem of finding shortest paths in a polygon can also be viewed as a graph problem, which is relevant to cs.GR (Graph Theory). Finally, the paper involves implementation details and programming in Python, which is relevant to cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
