This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category. Additionally, the paper focuses on the security aspect of MPTCP, specifically in mitigating man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) category. The paper also analyzes the Autonomous System (AS) level graph to identify countries and regions that are more robust against MITM attacks, which could fall under the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) category. The paper also discusses the use of MPTCP in various use-cases, such as mobile and fixed access networks, data centers, and core networks, which could fall under the Information Theory (cs.IT) category. Finally, the paper discusses the impact of core cable tapping and route hijacking practices on MITM attacks, which could fall under the Cybersecurity (cs.CY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
