This topic falls under the category of computer systems and architecture (cs.AR) as well as emerging technologies (cs.ET). Additionally, the paper focuses on neural networks (cs.NE) and their implementation in hardware (cs.EM). The proposed method also involves adapting the training process, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
