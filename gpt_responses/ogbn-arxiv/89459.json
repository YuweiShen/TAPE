The focus of the paper is on reducing the client-server communication in federated learning, which is a common challenge in distributed systems and networks (cs.DC). The proposed algorithm is evaluated on two datasets with deep neural networks, which are commonly used in computer vision and image processing tasks (cs.CV). Finally, the paper introduces a temporally weighted aggregation strategy on the server, which is a technique commonly used in control systems and optimization (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
