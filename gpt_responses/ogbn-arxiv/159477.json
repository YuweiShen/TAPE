This involves utilizing experimental data, combining multiple pieces of evidence, and taking experts' reliabilities into account. These concepts are closely related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The paper also discusses the use of historical statistics and data-driven approaches, which are relevant to social and information sciences (cs.SI) and software engineering (cs.SE).
