The use of Lyapunov-like functions and barrier functions suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of Systems and Control (cs.SY). The problem of goal assignment and trajectory generation involves decision making, which is a key aspect of Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA). The use of Lyapunov-like functions also suggests that the paper may be relevant to the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper proposes scalable and computationally efficient feedback control policies, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
