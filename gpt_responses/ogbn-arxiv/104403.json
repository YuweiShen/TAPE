The proposed Motion-Adaptive Feedback Cell (MAFC) is a novel block that captures motion compensation and feeds it back to the network, which involves machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the complex temporal dependency between frames, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with video processing, which could fall under graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
