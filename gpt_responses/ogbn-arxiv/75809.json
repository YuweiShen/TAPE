The use of probabilistic measures such as total variation and Kullback-Leibler divergence also suggests a connection to information theory. The paper also discusses the concept of stochastic processes, which is a topic in both data science (cs.DS) and systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
