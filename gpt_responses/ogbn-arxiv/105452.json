The use of a behavioural algorithm and function calls analysis suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The paper also discusses the experiments performed to validate the proposed approach, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the use of keylogging activity to detect bots suggests the involvement of network security (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
