This is a fundamental problem in the field of data structures and algorithms, and hence cs.DS is a likely sub-category.\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory): The concept of balancedness is related to the notion of entropy, which is a central concept in information theory. Moreover, the paper discusses the convergence properties of frequencies, which is also a topic of interest in information theory. Hence, cs.IT is another likely sub-category.\n3. cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper deals with symbolic systems, which are a central topic in formal languages and automata theory. Moreover, the paper discusses the properties of words and subshifts, which are also studied in this field. Hence, cs.FL is another likely sub-category.\n4. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses the convergence properties of frequencies, which is a topic of interest in logic and model theory. Moreover, the paper discusses the role played by coboundaries, which are also studied in this field. Hence, cs.LO is another likely sub-category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the properties of subshifts,"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
