The paper proposes a method to add spatial regularization to CNNs, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to improve model performance and robustness. The paper also mentions the use of total variation (TV), which is a mathematical concept commonly used in optimization problems (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on several datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
