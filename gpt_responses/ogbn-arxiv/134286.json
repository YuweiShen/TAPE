The paper proposes a novel task transfer framework that uses expert preference as guidance to learn the target cost function and trajectory distribution. This involves techniques such as Adversarial MaxEnt IRL and simulation on several benchmarks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
