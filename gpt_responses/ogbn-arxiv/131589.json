The paper also introduces a new method for connecting global evidence using graph neural networks, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper uses graph neural networks to perform evidence integration, which is a common task in neural networks (cs.NE) and computer vision (cs.CV).
