The specific application is in predicting epileptic seizures, which falls under the category of neuroscience (cs.NE). The paper also discusses using video prediction techniques, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper proposes a novel LSTM structure, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
