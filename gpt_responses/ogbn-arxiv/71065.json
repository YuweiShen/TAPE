This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including digital libraries (cs.DL), information retrieval (cs.IR), social and information networks (cs.SI), cybernetics (cs.CY), and software engineering (cs.SD). However, the focus on readerships and their distribution suggests that cs.DL and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.SI and cs.CY, while cs.SD is less likely but still possible."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
