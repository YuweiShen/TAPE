This topic is closely related to computer security (cs.CR), as the paper focuses on the use of encryption to protect users' privacy. The paper also touches on issues related to cybersecurity (cs.CY), as the lack of encryption can make it easier for attackers to intercept and manipulate Internet traffic. The use of software to automate certificate deployment is a topic in software engineering (cs.SE), while the analysis of adoption trends and market coverage is related to social and information networks (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
