The hierarchical structure of the users and the grouping of users into different classes suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the areas of distributed systems (cs.DS) and cloud computing (cs.CC), where similar hierarchical structures are often used. Finally, the use of fingerprinting codes in multimedia applications (cs.MM) is also a possibility, as these codes are often used to protect digital content such as audio and video."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
