The paper also mentions the use of deep neural networks, which falls under cs.DL. The dataset was built using weak supervision from Word and Latex documents, which could be related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper mentions building strong baselines using state-of-the-art models, which could be related to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
