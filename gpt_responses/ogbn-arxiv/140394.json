It involves the modeling of a vehicular data storage and distribution system, which requires the introduction of several parameters. The paper discusses the suitability or unsuitability of the vehicular environment for establishing a communication infrastructure with the desired quality. This work is related to the field of computer networks, specifically in the area of vehicular networks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other possible sub-categories include cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
