The paper also involves some combinatorial and algebraic techniques, which could place it in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SC (Symbolic Computation). The paper also deals with linear algebra and information theory, which could place it in cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
