This involves inferring both 3D surface and texture, handling arbitrary topology, and producing high-resolution surfaces including largely unseen regions such as the back of a person. These tasks are closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR), as well as machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques for deep learning. Additionally, the use of real-world images from the DeepFashion dataset suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
