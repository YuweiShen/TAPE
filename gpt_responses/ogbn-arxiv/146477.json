The paper focuses on natural language processing tasks, specifically generative multi-hop question answering, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also involves the use of machine learning techniques, such as attention mechanisms and pointer-generator decoders, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) research.
