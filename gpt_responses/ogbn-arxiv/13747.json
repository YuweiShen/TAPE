Specifically, the paper focuses on Adam and RMSProp, which are commonly used optimization algorithms in deep learning. Therefore, cs.NE (neural and evolutionary computing) and cs.AI (artificial intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of these algorithms in training deep neural networks, which suggests cs.CV (computer vision) as another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with optimization and convergence, which could also fit under cs.DS (data structures and algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
