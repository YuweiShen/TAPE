This involves studying the effect of key parameters on time and frequency, proposing a novel throughput and interference model, and presenting a case study. The paper thus falls under the categories of networked systems (cs.NI), information theory (cs.IT), multimedia (cs.MM), systems and control (cs.SY), and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
