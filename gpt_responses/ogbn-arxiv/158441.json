The proposed approach also involves attention mechanisms and regression-based discriminators, which are common in machine learning (LG) and natural language processing (NLP) fields. Additionally, the paper discusses the importance of avoiding spurious correlations between audio and video signals, which is a topic in computational linguistics (CL) and signal processing (SD). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.MM, followed by cs.SD, cs.LG, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
