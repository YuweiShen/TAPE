The use of diversity techniques is also relevant to wireless networks (cs.NI) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of the Gamma shadowed generalized Nakagami-m fading model, which is a topic in multimedia communications (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
