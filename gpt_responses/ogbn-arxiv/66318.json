This approach is compatible with any deep reinforcement learning methods and is scalable to a large number of agents. The paper also uses the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm to demonstrate the proposed scheme. Based on this information, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
