The paper focuses on orthonormalization layers, which are used to normalize the weights of the neural network. This topic is closely related to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and natural language processing (cs.CL). However, since the paper primarily focuses on the performance of the algorithms, we can assume that it is more likely to be classified under cs.LG, followed by cs.CV, cs.NE, cs.AI, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
