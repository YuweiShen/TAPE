The paper also references works on randomness and Kolmogorov complexity, which are typically studied in the sub-categories of cs.CC and cs.DS. The use of the term \"complexity\" in the abstract suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of cs.CR (cryptography). Finally, the mention of a \"van Lambalgen-type theorem\" suggests that the paper may be relevant to the sub-category of cs.LG (learning theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
