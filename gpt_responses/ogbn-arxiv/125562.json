The paper proposes a novel scoring function to combine binary predictions and introduces two online learning algorithms to solve the problem. The paper also discusses the neural network architecture for ordinal regression. Based on these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
