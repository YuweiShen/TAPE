The use of power control and partial feedback also suggests a possible connection to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The study of outage behavior and diversity gain is related to the Networked Systems (cs.NI) sub-category. Finally, the mention of a channel optimized scalar quantizer (COSQ) suggests a possible connection to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category, which deals with signal processing and compression techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
