The proposed approach involves graph convolution and can be easily plugged into existing CNNs. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves machine learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks, which suggests it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper proposes a new unit called GloRe unit, which involves weighted global pooling and broadcasting, suggesting it could belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper also involves video action recognition tasks, which suggests it could belong to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
