The experiments in feature selection and low-dimensional embedding of distributions also suggest a machine learning focus.\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper mentions the similarity of the proposed dependence measure to Shannon mutual information, which is a concept from information theory. The paper also discusses the invariance of the measure to strictly increasing transformations, which is a property of many information-theoretic measures.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed method for measuring dependence between random variables could be relevant to various AI applications, such as feature selection, data preprocessing, and generative models.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper mentions that the proposed estimator is robust to outliers and uses rank statistics only, which are properties that could be of interest to researchers in data structures and algorithms.\n5. cs.ST (Statistics): The paper proposes a new statistical method for measuring dependence between random variables, which could be of interest to researchers in statistics. The paper also derives upper bounds on the convergence rate and proposes independence tests, which are common topics in statistical theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
