The paper also uses Gaussian processes as surrogates to illustrate the proposed method. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), which are closely related to optimization and surrogate modeling. The paper also involves optimization algorithms and control systems, which suggest the sub-categories cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper uses statistical methods and data analysis, which are relevant to the sub-category cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
