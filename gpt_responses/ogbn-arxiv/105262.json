The paper proposes a new algorithm for undersampling imbalanced data, which is relevant to the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed algorithm is evaluated on image classification datasets, which are commonly studied in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the limitations of existing methods for dealing with data imbalance, which is relevant to the subfield of data mining (cs.DM). Finally, the paper proposes a new approach based on radial-based oversampling, which is related to the subfield of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
