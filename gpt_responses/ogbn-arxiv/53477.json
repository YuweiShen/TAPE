It could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) as machine learning techniques may have been used for the annotation process. Additionally, it could be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it deals with the role of script knowledge in natural language processing. It may also fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as the annotated corpus could be used for information retrieval tasks. Finally, it could be categorized under cs.CC (Computational Complexity) as the paper may discuss the computational complexity of the annotation process."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
