This is a common topic in the field of machine learning, which is covered by several arXiv CS sub-categories. The most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper deals with the behavior of classifiers and their generalization properties. The second likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), as the paper proposes a technique for bounded domains like images. The third likely category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as the paper deals with the behavior of neural networks and their ability to make low confidence predictions. The fourth likely category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), as the paper specifically discusses the behavior of ReLU type networks. The fifth likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), as the paper mentions safety-critical systems and the need for classifiers to know when they don't know."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
