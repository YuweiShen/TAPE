The proposed method involves the use of deep neural networks, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the limitations of existing coordinate output techniques, which is a topic related to graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on publicly available datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
