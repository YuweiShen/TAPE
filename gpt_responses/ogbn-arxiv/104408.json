The authors use Deep Convolutional Networks and Siamese-style Neural Networks for learning topological constructs and relational properties, which are techniques commonly used in Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves optimization techniques for recovering an accurate Pose Graph, which can be categorized under Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
