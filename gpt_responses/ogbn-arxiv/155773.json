The implementation is also provided on a bimanual robot, indicating a strong robotics focus. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The planner produces an efficient plan by intelligently deciding when the robot should change its grasp on the object, indicating the use of AI techniques. \n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper does not explicitly mention computer vision, but it is possible that vision-based sensing is used to detect the object and its orientation. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not mention the use of machine learning, but it is possible that machine learning techniques are used to learn the stability of different grasps. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with controlling a robotic system to maintain stability of an object under changing external forces, indicating a possible fit with the systems and control sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
