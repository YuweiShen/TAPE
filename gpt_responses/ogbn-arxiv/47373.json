The paper also discusses the role of vector processing hardware in CNN implementations, which falls under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR) and parallel computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper proposes a unified CNN framework for both high-level and low-level vision tasks, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
