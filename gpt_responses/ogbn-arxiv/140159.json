This falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of secret keys for secure communication (cs.CY) and the impact of the adversary on multimedia communication (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper explores the use of classical techniques for authentication (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
