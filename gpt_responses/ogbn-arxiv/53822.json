The paper also discusses the kinematic structure of the tool and the design of various tooltips, which involves mechanical engineering (cs.ME) and robotics (cs.ROB). The use of AR markers for locating the tool and selecting an automatically planned grasp involves computer vision (cs.CV) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
