The paper also introduces a new concept of fortifiers, which are graphs that have both $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ guarantees on induced distributions from large subsets. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the following sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The Parallel Repetition Theorem is a central result in computational complexity theory, and this paper provides a new proof technique for it. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper uses concepts from information theory, such as extractors, to construct fortifiers. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper introduces a new concept of fortifiers, which are graphs that have certain properties, and shows how they can be used to fortify label cover instances. This is likely to be of interest to researchers working on graph algorithms and data structures. \n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper uses geometric concepts, such as $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ guarantees, to define and analyze fortifiers. \n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The Parallel Repetition Theorem is a result in game theory, and this paper provides a new proof technique for it."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
