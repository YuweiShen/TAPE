The proposed method involves learning visual features from Web page snapshots, which suggests the Computer Vision (cs.CV) category. The paper also mentions a visual perception model inspired by human visual search behaviors, which falls under the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of inverted indexing for efficient feature acquisition, which suggests the Multimedia (cs.MM) category.
