The paper specifically mentions training the model on the Google Books Ngram corpus, which is a common dataset used in NLP research. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the use of neural networks suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) in identifying specific years of language change, which could place it under cs.IR. Finally, the use of word embeddings and vector representations suggests that the paper may also fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
