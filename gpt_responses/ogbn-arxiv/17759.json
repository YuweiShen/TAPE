This involves using convolutional neural networks to extract texture regions in a frame, which are then reconstructed using a global motion model. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n1. cs.MM (Multimedia): This sub-category deals with the processing, analysis, and retrieval of multimedia data, including images and videos. The proposed method involves texture analysis/synthesis in videos, which falls under this sub-category. \n\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category deals with the analysis and interpretation of images and videos. The proposed method involves using convolutional neural networks to extract texture regions in a frame, which falls under this sub-category. \n\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): As mentioned earlier, the proposed method involves texture analysis/synthesis in videos, which falls under this sub-category. \n\n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category deals with the retrieval of information from large datasets. The proposed method involves improving the coding efficiency of modern video codecs, which can be seen as a form of information retrieval. \n\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the development and application of machine learning algorithms. The proposed method involves using convolutional neural networks to extract texture regions in a"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
