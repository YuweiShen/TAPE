This involves numerical methods and computational techniques, which falls under the scope of cs.CE.\n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper discusses a least-squares approach for projecting parasitic strain components onto the physical space locally, which is a numerical method used to solve differential equations. This falls under the scope of cs.NA.\n- cs.MS (Mathematical Software): The paper proposes a new formulation for isogeometric analysis of thin Reissner Mindlin plates and shells, which may require the development of new mathematical software. This falls under the scope of cs.MS.\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper discusses the ability of the proposed formulation to capture deformations of thin shells using relatively coarse meshes, which involves geometric computations. This falls under the scope of cs.CG.\n- cs.ME (Mechanical Engineering): The paper addresses locking in degenerated Reissner-Mindlin plate and shell formulations, which is a common issue in mechanical engineering. This falls under the scope of cs.ME."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
