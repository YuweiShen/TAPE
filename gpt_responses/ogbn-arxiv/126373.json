This system falls under the category of machine learning and artificial intelligence, which is covered by cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of a modified RNN and GWO also suggests that the paper may fall under the category of neural networks and evolutionary computation, which are covered by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the potential benefits of the proposed system for improving instruction by the faculty and enhancing the students' learning experiences, which suggests that it may fall under the category of software engineering, covered by cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed system in the context of education, which suggests that it may fall under the category of computers and society, covered by cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
