The use of deep learning and convolution neural networks also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The attention-based multiple instance pooling and loss minimization techniques used in the proposed method suggest that it could also belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the use of aerial images suggests that it could belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
