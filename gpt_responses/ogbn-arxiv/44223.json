The paper also focuses on improving the scalability of the parallelization, which is a key aspect of Large Scale Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). The use of the GPI-2 communication library is also a significant aspect of the paper, which falls under the category of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.Distributed) and Mathematical Software (cs.MS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
