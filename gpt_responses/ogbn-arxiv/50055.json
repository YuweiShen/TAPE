The paper also presents a geometric technique for approximating mean and median points, which falls under computational geometry (cs.CG). The paper's focus on handling high-dimensional data suggests that it could also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper's use of constraints in clustering suggests that it could be relevant to social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
