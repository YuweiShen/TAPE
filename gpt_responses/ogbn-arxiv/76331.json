The use of deep learning techniques also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) category. The paper also involves the use of prior knowledge about the optics of dual-pixel image formation, which could place it in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) category. The development of an approach to estimate depth up to an inherent ambiguity suggests that it could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) category. Finally, the use of view supervision to learn depth from a large dataset of in-the-wild images suggests that it could belong to the graphics (cs.GR) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
