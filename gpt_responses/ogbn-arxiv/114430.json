It proposes a blockchain-supported architecture to create an immutable record of every data generated within the lifespan of a smart car, ensuring trust and security. This aligns with the scope of cs.CR.\n2. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the privacy concerns related to smart car data and proposes a privacy-friendly sharing mechanism. It also addresses the trust deficit related to some types of data that remain under the custody of the car owner. These issues are related to the societal impact of smart cars and align with the scope of cs.CY.\n3. cs.DB (Databases): The paper proposes an architecture to manage and share data generated by smart cars. It discusses the challenge of managing multiple parties involved in the lifespan of a smart car and proposes a blockchain-supported solution. This aligns with the scope of cs.DB.\n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a blockchain-supported architecture to manage and share data generated by smart cars. This aligns with the scope of cs.DC, which deals with distributed computing and communication.\n5. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes an architecture to manage and share data generated by smart cars. It discusses the challenge of"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
