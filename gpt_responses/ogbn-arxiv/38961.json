Therefore, cs.IR and cs.LG are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also uses deep reinforcement learning methods, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper deals with optimizing the ranking function by adapting to the online data distribution, which involves data science (cs.DS) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
