The paper proposes two novel greedy approaches to solving this problem and analyzes their sparsistency. The paper also compares the proposed methods to existing methods such as the Graphical Lasso and Neighborhood Lasso. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and stat.ML (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
