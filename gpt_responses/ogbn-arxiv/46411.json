The approach proposed involves using temporal logic, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses a hybrid control framework, which is relevant to control systems (cs.SY). The use of an iterator to manage the discretised workspace is related to programming languages and compilers (cs.PL). Finally, the paper deals with temporal logic specifications, which is a topic in logic and verification (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
