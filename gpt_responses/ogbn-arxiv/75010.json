The use of surrogate models and optimization algorithms falls under the category of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.NE, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of Tabu Search and local candidate search, which are optimization techniques falling under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the use of Radial Basis Function (RBF) approximation, which is a technique used in computational engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the paper presents results on real-world watershed problems, which fall under the category of environmental science and engineering (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
