The focus of the paper is on developing a space-efficient algorithm for this problem in the semi-streaming model, which is a well-studied model in theoretical computer science. The paper uses techniques from data structures, algorithms, and information theory to achieve its results. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
