The paper presents a new benchmark dataset called CIFAR10H, which contains a full distribution of human labels for each image of the CIFAR10 test set. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also discusses the training of deep neural networks, which suggests that it could belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with improving the generalization of deep neural networks, which could place it in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. \n\nThe paper also discusses the robustness of deep neural networks to adversarial attacks, which could place it in the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of explicit training on a new dataset, which could place it in the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
