The paper also proposes a novel detection pipeline that benefits from the two-stage cascade strategy, which involves machine learning techniques, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of a simpler network architecture adapted for small input sizes, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The proposed pipeline is also designed for real-time performance, which could place it under cs.RO (Robotics) or cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
