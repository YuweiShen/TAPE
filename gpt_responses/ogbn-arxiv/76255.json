This problem is relevant in several applications, including data transformation and entity resolution, which are typically associated with the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and databases (cs.DB). The paper also uses complexity-theoretic tools to analyze the computational hardness and approximability of the rule selection problem, which are typical of the sub-categories of algorithms and complexity (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper considers bi-objective and bi-level optimization versions of the rule selection problem, which are related to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
