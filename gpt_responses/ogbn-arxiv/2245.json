The paper also discusses the use of features inspired by human vision, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper addresses the design choices for the episodic memory, which involves natural language processing techniques (cs.CL) such as retrieval methods. Finally, the paper uses neural networks, which are a common tool in the field of neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
