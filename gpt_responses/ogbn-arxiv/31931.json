It also involves the study of error-correcting codes, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The use of the covering radius of the dual code suggests that this paper may also be relevant to the field of signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the MDS conjecture is a well-known problem in coding theory, which is a topic in theoretical computer science (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
