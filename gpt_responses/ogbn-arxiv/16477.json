The paper also explores the use of additional spectral information and proposes methods for integrating it into deep learning architectures, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The study also examines how various features of the data affect building detection accuracy, which could fall under the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the paper establishes accuracy trends with respect to building size and scene density, which could fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
