It also involves cooperation among transmitters, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI). The paper discusses message assignments and their impact on the per user DoF number, which could be considered a problem in optimization (cs.OH) or machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of local cooperation constraints, which could be related to signal processing (cs.SP) or communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
