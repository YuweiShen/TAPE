The paper proposes a new objective for training neural text generation models, which is relevant to both NLP and machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). \n\nThe paper also discusses the problems with standard likelihood training and decoding, which are related to model optimization and inference, respectively. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). \n\nFinally, the paper evaluates its approach using human evaluations and compares it to existing decoding methods, which involves some aspects of natural language understanding and evaluation. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision), which often involves human evaluations of visual content. \n\nTherefore, the five most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.CV, in descending order of likelihood."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
