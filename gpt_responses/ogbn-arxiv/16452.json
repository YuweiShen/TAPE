The use of Cantor normal forms for ordinals and the well-ordering of type $\\epsilon_0$ suggest a connection to computability theory and set theory, which are subfields of logic. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also discusses encodability in Plotkin's PCF, which is a programming language, and the notion of observational equivalence, which is a concept in semantics. This suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL), type theory (cs.TL), formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL), and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
