The authors also propose a novel temporal interlacing network and explore variants of the SlowFast network, which are both deep learning architectures (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of ensembling, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.MM). Additionally, the authors mention the use of PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework (cs.AI), and the release of a code repository for video understanding, which involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques for video captioning (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
