It also involves multiple users and decoding schemes, which are relevant to networked systems (cs.NI) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The study of Shannon capacity of a graph is also mentioned, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the properties of feasible rate vectors, which could be considered a topic in social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
