It could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories as it proposes a new algorithm for computing universal adversarial perturbations. The paper also discusses the characteristics of decision boundaries learned by standard and adversarially trained models, which could make it relevant to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) category. Finally, the use of linear functions of weights in the proposed method suggests that it could be relevant to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
