The paper also employs machine learning techniques (cs.LG) to derive security bounds for WF defenses. Additionally, the paper discusses the privacy concerns of users (cs.CY) and proposes a method to identify optimal feature sets (cs.SI) for WF defenses. Finally, the paper's approach of deriving security bounds for ML-based attacks could be applicable to other areas of computer science, such as artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
