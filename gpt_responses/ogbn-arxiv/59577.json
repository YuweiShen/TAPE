This topic falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of classical image segmentation approaches, which could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper presents experimental results on multiple datasets, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
