Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely category. The paper also proposes a new framework that uses multiple Feature Polishing Modules (FPMs) to improve the accuracy of multi-level features, which involves machine learning techniques. Hence, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are also likely categories. The paper also uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the backbone architecture, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia) category. Finally, the paper does not explicitly mention any neural architecture search (NAS) techniques, but the proposed framework can be seen as a form of neural architecture design, which falls under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
