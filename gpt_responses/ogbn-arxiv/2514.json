This involves the use of multi-spectral perception algorithms, navigation and mapping systems, and ground intervention hardware and software solutions. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category, as well as Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories due to the use of perception algorithms. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories due to the autonomous nature of the system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
