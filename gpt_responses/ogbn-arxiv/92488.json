The paper also discusses the use of hybrid systems models and trajectory optimization, which are topics related to control systems (cs.SY). The mechanical design of the robot and the use of springs falls under the category of mechanical engineering (cs.ME). The paper also discusses the energetic efficiency of the robot, which is related to energy technology (cs.ET). Finally, the experimental validation of the robot's performance falls under the category of computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
