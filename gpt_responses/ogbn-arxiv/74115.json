The paper focuses on queueing models and their application to anonymity metrics, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses randomized batch mixing strategies, which may fall under the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-categories.
