This involves delivering recommendations through an API to platforms such as reference management software and digital libraries. The paper is likely to fall under the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) category, as it deals with the task of recommending scholarly papers, citations, conferences, and research grants. It may also fall under the Digital Libraries (cs.DL) category, as the living lab is built on top of a recommender-system as-a-service. The paper may also be relevant to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category, as it discusses novel algorithms for scholarly recommendations. Additionally, the paper may be relevant to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) category, as it deals with the user experience of scholarly recommendations. Finally, the paper may be relevant to the Cybersecurity (cs.CY) category, as it discusses the security and privacy implications of delivering recommendations through an API."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
