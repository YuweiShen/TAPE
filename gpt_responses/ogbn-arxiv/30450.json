This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents an algorithm for computing permanents, mixed discriminants, and hyperdeterminants, which are fundamental objects in algebraic geometry and combinatorics, and requires analyzing the sparsity structure of an array in terms of a graph. This suggests that the paper is likely to be of interest to researchers in data structures and algorithms.\n\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper analyzes the computational complexity of computing permanents, mixed discriminants, and hyperdeterminants of structured matrices and multidimensional arrays (tensors) based on the sparsity structure of an array in terms of a graph and assuming small treewidth.
