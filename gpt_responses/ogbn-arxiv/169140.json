Therefore, cs.CV and cs.LG are the most likely categories. The paper also involves the use of neural networks, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (AI) and neural engineering (NE). Finally, the paper deals with tracking multiple targets in a cluttered environment, which is related to robotics (RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
