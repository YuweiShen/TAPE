This is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper specifically focuses on incorporating knowledge of qualitative influences and monotonicities, which are concepts related to data mining (cs.DM) and social networks (cs.SI). The use of Bayesian network learning algorithms also suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
