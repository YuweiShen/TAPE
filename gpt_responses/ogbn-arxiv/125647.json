This is a common problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) research, and the paper also mentions the use of a modified planner, which falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the features of domains that can be exploited by the proposed method, which falls under the category of programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
