This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Digital Libraries (cs.DL) sub-categories, as it deals with the analysis of large data sets and their distribution. Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of real-world economic constraints on the growth of globally stored information, which could place it in the Cybersecurity (cs.CY) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories.
