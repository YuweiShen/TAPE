This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes an approach for helping end-users build a mental model of such policies, which involves showing the user the critical states of the policy. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of neural network policies, which suggests that it may belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper proposes an approach for helping humans make informed decisions about when to deploy a policy and when to take control from it, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the interaction between humans and robots, which suggests that it may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
