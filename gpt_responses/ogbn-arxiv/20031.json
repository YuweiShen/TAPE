This suggests a connection to data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation and Formal Verification): The paper mentions the computation of Kronecker coefficients, which are related to the representation theory of the symmetric group. This suggests a connection to symbolic computation and formal verification. \n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper mentions the moment polytopes of orbit closures, which are objects of interest in computational geometry. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with representations of Lie groups, which are important in the study of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
