This involves encoding high-order data correlation in a hypergraph structure, which is more flexible for modeling complex data. The paper also presents experiments on citation network classification and visual object recognition tasks, indicating that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
