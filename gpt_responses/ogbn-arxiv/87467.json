The paper specifically focuses on linear precoding, which is a signal processing technique used in MIMO systems, and hence, cs.SI and cs.MM are likely categories. However, the paper also deals with quantization and optimization, which are key concepts in information theory and machine learning, respectively. Therefore, cs.IT and cs.LG are also likely categories. Finally, since the paper deals with wireless communication systems, cs.NI is also a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
