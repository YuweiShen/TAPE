The paper proposes a new smoothness criterion that takes into account both the nonlinearity of the reward and concentration properties of the arms. This suggests that the paper is likely to be relevant to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers papers on various aspects of machine learning, including optimization, bandits, and reinforcement learning, which are all relevant to the paper. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers papers on various aspects of AI, including optimization and decision-making, which are relevant to the paper. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): This sub-category covers papers on various aspects of algorithms and data structures, which are relevant to the paper. \n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): This sub-category covers papers on various aspects of game theory, which is relevant to the paper since the multi-armed bandit problem can be viewed as a game between the agent and the environment. \n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category covers papers on various aspects of information theory, which is relevant to the paper since the smoothness criterion proposed in the paper is based on concentration properties of the arms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
