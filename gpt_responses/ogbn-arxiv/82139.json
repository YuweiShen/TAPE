The talk also mentions the breakdown of classical viewpoints when data size becomes large, which is a common problem in data science (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the talk may touch on information theory (cs.IT) as it relates to the formulation of big data experiments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
