The applications mentioned in the abstract, distributed storage, fall under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the scaling of the number of encoded bits with respect to block-length, which is a topic related to data structures (cs.DS). The concept of local repairability is also mentioned, which is a topic related to systems and control (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with the efficiency of encoding and decoding, which is a topic related to network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
