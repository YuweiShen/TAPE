It also discusses the use of polymorphisms in solving CSPs, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC) and logic (cs.LO). The paper also touches on the relationship between CSPs and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and the use of algebraic structures in solving CSPs, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
