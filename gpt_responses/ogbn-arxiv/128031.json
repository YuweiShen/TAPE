The use of pVASS as abstractions of probabilistic programs suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) category. The techniques developed for checking fast termination involve analyzing the worst expected number of transitions needed to reach a configuration with some counter negative, which involves the use of data structures and algorithms, making the paper relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) category. The paper also deals with nondeterminism, which is a topic that falls under the category of Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL).
