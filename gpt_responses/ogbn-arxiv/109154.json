The use of ensemble models for predictive capabilities is also a common technique in machine learning, further supporting the cs.AI category. The paper also discusses the use of a distributed infrastructure and parallelism, which are topics related to distributed computing (cs.DC). The autotuning framework is designed to learn application knowledge during the production phase, which is a topic related to software engineering (cs.SE).
