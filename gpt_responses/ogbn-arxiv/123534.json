Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of Monte-Carlo simulations and connection-style proof search, which are topics related to machine learning (ML) and logic (LO), respectively. Hence, cs.LG and cs.LO are also likely sub-categories. The paper also mentions the evaluation of the system on a large corpus of mathematical problems, which involves natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics (CL). Therefore, cs.CL is another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the development of a prover, which is a topic related to programming languages (PL). Hence, cs.PL is a less likely but still possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
