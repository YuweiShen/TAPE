This falls under the sub-category of Information Theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the relationship between the codes and their dual, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). The study of generating sets and parameters of the codes involves computational complexity (cs.DS) and optimization (cs.SI). Lastly, the paper also touches on the Gray images of the codes, which is a topic in image processing (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
