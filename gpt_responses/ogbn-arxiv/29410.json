The paper proposes a novel Wi-Fi monetization model for venue owners deploying public Wi-Fi hotspots, which involves the economic interactions among various stakeholders. \n\n2. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The proposed Wi-Fi monetization model involves the use of an ad platform to sell ad spaces to advertisers and share the payments with venue owners. This involves computational and economic modeling, which falls under the purview of computational engineering, finance, and science. \n\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The proposed Wi-Fi monetization model involves the use of advertising sponsored access, in which mobile users watch advertisements in exchange for free Wi-Fi usage. This involves the delivery of multimedia content (advertisements) over the Wi-Fi network, which falls under the purview of multimedia. \n\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The proposed Wi-Fi monetization model involves the economic interactions among various stakeholders, including venue owners, mobile users, and advertisers. This involves the study of social and information networks, which can be used to model the interactions among these stakeholders. \n\n5. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The proposed Wi-Fi monetization model involves the use"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
