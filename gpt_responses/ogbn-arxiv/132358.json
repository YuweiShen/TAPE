The use of Krylov subspace methods and iterative methods for subspace decomposition also suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY). The use of millimeter wave technology and the comparison with a fully digital case suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the focus on cost and power consumption suggests a connection to computer communication (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
