Therefore, the most likely category is cs.SC (Symbolic Computation). The paper also involves the analysis of algorithms and their complexity, which suggests that it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The use of linear algebra in the proposed algorithm suggests that it could also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
