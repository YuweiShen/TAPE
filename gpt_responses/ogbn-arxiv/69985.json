Additionally, the paper focuses on ensuring honesty of processes, which could fall under the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. The use of contracts and sessions also suggests a possible fit for the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The paper also discusses security and adversarial contexts, which could place it in the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses type inference and decidable typing, which could suggest a fit for the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
