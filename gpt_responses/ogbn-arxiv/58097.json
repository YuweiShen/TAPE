This is a core problem in information theory, and hence cs.IT is the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the potential of NOMA to improve the system performance in future 5G networks and beyond. This makes cs.NI a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a fairness-based beamforming approach through a max-min formulation to maintain fairness between users. This involves designing a control system to optimize the beamforming weights, which falls under the purview of cs.SY.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the potential of NOMA to improve the system performance in terms of transmit power consumption, which is relevant to multimedia applications that require high data rates and low power consumption.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper employs Taylor series approximation and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques to reformulate the original non-convex power minimization problem to a tractable one. This involves computational techniques that are relevant to cs.CE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
