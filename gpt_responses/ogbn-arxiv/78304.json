It also involves comparing computed values to those provided by a checking computation, which can be seen as a form of fault tolerance or error detection (cs.DC). The paper proposes a new paradigm for detecting silent errors at the application level, which involves optimizing and testing methods for specific equations, such as the heat equation and Navier-Stokes equations, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE) and scientific computing (cs.SC). Finally, the paper also involves optimization and testing of numerical methods, which falls under the category of mathematical software (cs.MS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
