It proposes a DNN structure that takes advantage of permutation invariant a priori information in wireless tasks, resulting in reduced model parameters and training complexity. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of unsupervised learning for predictive resource allocation, which falls under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. The proposed DNN structure also has implications for control systems (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in wireless networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
