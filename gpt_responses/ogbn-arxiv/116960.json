This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also proposes a new approach for occupancy mapping that models the binary nature of occupancy measurements precisely, via a Bernoulli distribution, and provides an efficient approximation of GP classification. This involves machine learning techniques such as Gaussian Process regression and classification, which fall under the categories of computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of the proposed method for planning autonomous mapping trajectories, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
