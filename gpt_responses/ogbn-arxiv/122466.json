The paper presents new results on the complexity of this problem, depending on the type of graph exploration queries that can be made. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to several subfields of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), information retrieval (cs.IR), social and information networks (cs.SI), control and optimization (cs.SY), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
