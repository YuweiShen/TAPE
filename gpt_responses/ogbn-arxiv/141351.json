The use of deep neural networks to learn a complex function also falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The iterative refinement over transformation parameters involves optimization techniques, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NE) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
