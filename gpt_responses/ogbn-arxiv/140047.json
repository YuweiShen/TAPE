The model combines short-term sessions and long-term behaviors and uses multi-head self-attention and long-short term gated fusion modules to encode behavior sequences. The paper also reports offline experiments on real-world datasets and successful deployment on an online large-scale recommender system at Taobao. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is Information Retrieval (cs.IR), followed by Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
