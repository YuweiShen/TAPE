It also applies this method to models trained on natural images and genomic data, which suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and bioinformatics (cs.BIO) applications. Additionally, the use of neural networks implies a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational neuroscience (cs.NE). Finally, the mention of interpretability suggests a potential connection to natural language processing (cs.CL) and explainable AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
