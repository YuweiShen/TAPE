The use of capsule network architecture also suggests a potential connection to neural networks (cs.NE) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves training a nonlinear mapping from fMRI data to high-level capsule features, which could be related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed method on handwritten digital images suggests a potential connection to human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
