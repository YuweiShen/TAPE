The paper also proposes a modified frequency domain estimation method, which involves signal processing techniques such as multisine excitation and phase coupling, making it relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of frequency domain techniques also suggests that the paper may be relevant to the sub-category of numerical analysis (cs.NA). Additionally, the paper involves experimental data analysis, which falls under the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and systems and control (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
