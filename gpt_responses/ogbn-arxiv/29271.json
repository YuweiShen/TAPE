The paper presents a new approach for performing predicate abstraction based on symbolic decision procedures. The paper also presents symbolic decision procedures for the logic of Equality and Uninterpreted Functions (EUF) and Difference logic (DIFF). Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Other likely sub-categories include cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory), cs.SE (Software Engineering), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
