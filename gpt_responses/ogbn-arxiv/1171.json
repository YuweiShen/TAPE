Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also involves the use of point-based networks and view selection, which are common in robotics (cs.RO) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper deals with 3D data and canonical space, which are relevant to computer graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
