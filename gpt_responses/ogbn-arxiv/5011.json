This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The use of Gaussian process priors and Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers also suggests that the paper may belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-categories. Finally, the application to cardiac electrophysiology suggests that the paper may also belong to the Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
