The use of diversity optimization for obtaining a better understanding of possible solutions to a problem is also relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). The experimental investigations involve evolving diverse sets of images, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
