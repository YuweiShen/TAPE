This falls under the sub-category of Information Theory (cs.IT) and Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). The paper also uses results from finite fields, which is a topic in Discrete Structures (cs.DS). The use of equations and solving them over finite fields suggests the sub-category of Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper may also fall under the sub-category of Computational Complexity (cs.CC) as it deals with the complexity of solving equations over finite fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
