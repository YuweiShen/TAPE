It also involves the use of multiple antennas at each node, which is a topic in wireless communication and networking (cs.NI). The paper also discusses interference management techniques, which is a topic in signal processing (cs.SI). The use of multiple antennas also falls under the category of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the issue of rate-splitting and partial decoding, which is a topic in communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
