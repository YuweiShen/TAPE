The paper also presents a new dataset (3DPeople) with annotated segmentation masks, skeletons, depth, normal maps, and optical flow, which falls under computer graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper proposes a novel shape parameterization algorithm based on optimal mass transportation, which is a mathematical optimization technique and falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
