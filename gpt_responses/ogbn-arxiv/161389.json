The framework involves training examples with complementary labels, which are often used in computer vision and natural language processing tasks (cs.CV, cs.CL). The paper also includes theoretical analysis of the proposed approach, which falls under the category of statistical learning theory (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
