This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Cryptography and Security (cs.CR), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Multimedia (cs.MM). However, given the focus on interference and jamming, cs.IT and cs.NI are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.CR, cs.SY, and cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
