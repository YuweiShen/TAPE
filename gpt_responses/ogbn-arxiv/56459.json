The paper focuses on a method that adapts a deep neural architecture from the domain of machine reading comprehension to re-rank suggested answers from different models using the question as context. This suggests that the paper could belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with natural language processing and could be a likely fit for this paper as it discusses language modeling and generation for conversational agents. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the development of intelligent agents and could be a likely fit for this paper as it discusses the use of deep neural models for conversational agents. \n- cs.LG (Learning): This sub-category deals with machine learning and could be a likely fit for this paper as it discusses the use of deep neural models for conversational agents. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category deals with the retrieval of information from large datasets and could be a likely fit for this paper as it discusses the use of traditional approaches based on information retrieval for conversational agents. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): This sub-category deals with the analysis of algorithms and their complexity and may be a less likely fit for this paper, but could be relevant as"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
