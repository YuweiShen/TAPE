Therefore, cs.HC and cs.SE are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also uses computer vision techniques to identify errors, which suggests that cs.CV is a likely sub-category as well. Additionally, the paper discusses the implementation of the tool, which falls under programming languages (cs.PL) and software development (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
