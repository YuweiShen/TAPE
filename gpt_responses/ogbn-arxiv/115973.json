The paper proposes a new method for experience reuse in reinforcement learning, which is a topic that falls under the category of \"reinforcement learning\" and \"experience replay\". The paper also experiments with the proposed method on a set of tasks, including grid world navigation, locomotion, and fighting tasks, which are related to robotics, computer vision, and game AI. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves computer vision and game AI, which are related to cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.GR (Computer Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
