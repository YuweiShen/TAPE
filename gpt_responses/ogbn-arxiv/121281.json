The paper also proposes a new type system for XPath, which is a language used for querying XML documents, and discusses its formal properties, which could be of interest to researchers in the formal methods (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed optimization techniques, which could be of interest to researchers in the software engineering (cs.SE) sub-category.
