This work involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, which are typically covered in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses a stochastic temporal grammar to help the agent learn complex temporal dependencies, which falls under the cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-category.
