The proposed method involves constructing an object pattern dictionary and extracting high-level semantic features based on probability and del parameter. This approach is likely to fall under the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category deals with the fundamental problems of computer vision, including image processing, feature extraction, and object recognition. The paper's focus on indoor image feature extraction makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the development of intelligent agents that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve goals. The paper's proposed method of extracting high-level semantic features could be seen as an AI approach to indoor image representation. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the development of algorithms that can learn from data and improve their performance over time. The paper's proposed method involves calculating probabilities and extracting features based on them, which is a common approach in machine learning. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category deals with the development of algorithms that can retrieve relevant information from large datasets. The paper's proposed method of constructing an object pattern dictionary and retrieving semantic objects from it could be seen as an information retrieval approach to indoor image representation. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
