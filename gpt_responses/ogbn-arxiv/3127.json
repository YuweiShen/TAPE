Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves optimization frameworks and machine learning techniques, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of object detectors and tracking-by-detection framework could also relate to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
