Additionally, the study involves human-robot interaction and evaluation of trust, which are relevant to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The use of objective and subjective measures to evaluate trust also suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories.
