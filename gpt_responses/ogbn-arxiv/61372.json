This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG the most likely category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of IRL and the incorporation of human priors into the learning process also falls under the domain of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI a likely category.\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper discusses the ability of the model to capture visually distinct obstacle boundaries, which falls under the domain of computer vision. Therefore, cs.CV is also a likely category.\n4. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the use of the learned cost function for motion planning, which is a key component of robotics. Therefore, cs.RO is also a likely category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the ability of the model to handle corner cases such as stairs, slopes, and underpasses, which falls under the domain of systems and control. Therefore, cs.SY is also a likely category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
