This falls under the domain of game theory. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a learning policy for the seller to set reserve prices, which involves estimating buyers' demand curves from contextual information. This involves machine learning techniques. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a policy for the seller to set reserve prices that maximizes revenue, while taking into account the behavior of strategic buyers. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a pricing policy that achieves a regret bound of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{dT})$, which involves designing efficient algorithms for dynamic pricing. \n5. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper deals with repeated auctions with multiple strategic buyers, and proposes a policy that is robust to strategic bids.
