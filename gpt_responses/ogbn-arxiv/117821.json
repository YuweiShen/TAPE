Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communication and Networking) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses statistical models and their impact on achievable information rates, which falls under the scope of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper uses a rudimentary WDM channel model, which could be classified under cs.SI (Systems and Control) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
