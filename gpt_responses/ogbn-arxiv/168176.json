This suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL). The paper also mentions the use of spreadsheets for decision support systems, which falls under human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and databases (cs.DB). Finally, the paper suggests the value of Example Driven Modelling, which could fall under cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
