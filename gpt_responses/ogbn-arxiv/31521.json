The use of 3D-CNNs and LSTMs for spatio-temporal modeling indicates that it could be in the computer vision (cs.CV) category. The use of textual descriptions as an intermediate-level semantic representation suggests that it could also belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) category. The use of a zero-shot learning framework suggests that it could be in the machine learning (cs.LG) category. The fact that it deals with sign language recognition suggests that it could be in the multimedia (cs.MM) category. Finally, the potential applications of the research in assistive technology and human-computer interaction suggest that it could also belong to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
