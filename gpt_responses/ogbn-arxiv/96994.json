The use of polar codes for achieving secrecy rates suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of cryptography (cs.CR). Additionally, the paper involves coding theory, which is a sub-field of computer science that falls under the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of stochastic models and empirical analysis suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of statistics (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
