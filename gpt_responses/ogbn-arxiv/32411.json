The paper also discusses the use of activation functions such as rectified linear units, which are commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE). The paper's focus on optimization and recovery of global minimum suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
