Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also discusses the use of popular DNN benchmarks such as AlexNet and VGG-16, which suggests cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as another possible category. Finally, the paper proposes an auto-parallelization framework that optimizes GPU utilization, which could fall under cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
