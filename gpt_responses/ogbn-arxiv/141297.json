The system uses Prolog for efficient instance retrieval queries, which is a programming language commonly used in Logic Programming (cs.PL). The paper also mentions the use of a database for storing individuals, which suggests a connection to Database Systems (cs.DB). Additionally, the paper discusses the scalability of the system, which is a concern in Software Engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper is published in the journal Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), which is a strong indication of its relevance to Logic (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
