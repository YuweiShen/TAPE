The focus on spectral heuristics and their analysis suggests a stronger connection to cs.DM and cs.CC, but the paper's use of random and semirandom graph models also suggests relevance to cs.DS and cs.NA. The paper's title and abstract do not provide enough information to definitively narrow down the sub-categories, so these five options are the most likely based on the general topic and methods described."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
