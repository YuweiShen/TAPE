It could also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as summarization is a common task in this field. Additionally, the use of a graph-based algorithm suggests that it could be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the focus on improving evaluation metrics could also make it relevant to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
