The use of full-text and keyword indexes is a common approach to solve this problem, which suggests that the paper could belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses techniques for solving the $k$-mismatches problem, which is a common problem in information retrieval (IR) and database (DB) systems, suggesting that the paper could also belong to the cs.IR and cs.DB sub-categories. The paper also discusses techniques for data compaction and cache-friendliness, which are common concerns in parallel and distributed computing (CC) and data-centric computing (DC), suggesting that the paper could also belong to the cs.CC and cs.DC sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
