The paper also discusses the optimization problem and proposes approximation methods, which are relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). The use of semidefinite relaxation and first-order approximation techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.MM) and learning (cs.LG) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
