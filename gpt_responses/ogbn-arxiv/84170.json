The paper specifically focuses on weakly-supervised object detection and proposes a method that uses saliency detection and self-paced curriculum learning to improve the accuracy of object detection. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques such as self-paced curriculum learning, which is a form of active learning. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to the sub-categories cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe paper also involves image processing techniques such as saliency detection, which is a subfield of multimedia processing. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to the sub-categories cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval), which deal with image and video processing and retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
