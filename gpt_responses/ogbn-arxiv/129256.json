This involves channel estimation, rate adaptation, and user scheduling, which are all related to information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The scheduling problem is a partially observable Markov decision process, which falls under the category of control and optimization (cs.SY). The paper also uses the framework of Restless Multi-armed Bandit Processes (RMBP), which is a subfield of multi-armed bandit theory (cs.MA). Finally, the paper derives an index policy for the scheduling problem, which involves decision-making and optimization, and can be considered as a form of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
