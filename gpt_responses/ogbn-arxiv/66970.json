The approach involves generating potential paths through passages and scoring them without any direct path supervision. This involves using entity pair representations and composing them to encode each path. The paper also discusses how the model is able to explain its reasoning via these explicit paths through the passages. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning), as these categories are most relevant to natural language processing and machine learning. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) and neural networks (NE), so these categories are also likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
