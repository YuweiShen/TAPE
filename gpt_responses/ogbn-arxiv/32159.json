The paper also discusses the use of sparse Gaussian processes (GP) for trajectory estimation, which is a topic that falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper mentions the use of continuous-time trajectory representations, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of Lie groups, which are a mathematical concept that is relevant to control theory and systems engineering (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the use of probabilistic non-parametric trajectory representations, which is a topic that is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
