The proposed technique involves the use of a min-cost flow network model, which is a common optimization technique used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the evaluation of the proposed technique using precision and recall metrics, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL).
