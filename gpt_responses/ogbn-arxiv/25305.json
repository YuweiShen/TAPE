The paper also discusses the impact of feedback on the capacity of the interference channel, which is a topic of interest in the field of signal processing and communication (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper uses mathematical models and analysis to derive the capacity regions, which is relevant to the field of mathematical modeling (cs.MM) and computer engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
