The use of box splines and their efficient realization through preintegration and local finite-differences suggests numerical analysis (cs.NA) and multimedia (cs.MM) as possible sub-categories. Finally, the scaling property and quasi-separable structure of box distributions hint at information theory (cs.IT) as another potential sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
