The paper proposes a Bayesian framework that uses a multi-hypothesis strategy to handle color constancy ambiguity. This involves selecting a set of candidate scene illuminants and estimating the likelihood of the light source being achromatic. The paper also uses a camera-agnostic CNN to enable effective multi-camera training. Given these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV). Other likely sub-categories include machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
