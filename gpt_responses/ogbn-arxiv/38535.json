The paper discusses the impact of receive spatial diversity on the achievable sum-rate of the multi-cell random beamforming system. This involves the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast system, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the use of different spatial diversity receivers, which involves network optimization (cs.NI) and system engineering (cs.SY). The paper also characterizes the degrees of freedom (DoF) region for the multi-cell RBF system, which involves mathematical analysis (cs.MM) and optimization (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
