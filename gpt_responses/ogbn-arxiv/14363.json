Therefore, cs.CV and cs.MM are the most likely categories. The paper also discusses the use of deep learning models, which falls under cs.LG. Additionally, the paper focuses on the task of retrieval, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
