The concept of pointed pseudo-triangulations involves data structures and algorithms, which are also relevant to the cs.DS sub-category. The paper also discusses the combinatorial properties of pointed pseudo-triangulations, which is related to the cs.DM sub-category. The applications of pointed pseudo-triangulations include mesh generation and optimization, which are relevant to the cs.GR sub-category.
