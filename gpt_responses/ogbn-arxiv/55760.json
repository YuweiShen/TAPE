The focus is on achieving low latency and high reliability, which are important aspects of networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also uses the effective capacity (EC) framework, which is a tool commonly used in the analysis of communication systems (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper considers transmissions over Rayleigh fading channels, which is a topic related to wireless communication (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with multiuser NOMA networks, which is a topic related to communication networks (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
