The paper proposes a novel integration of data compression, immutable off-chain data storage, and a new consensus protocol, which involves aspects of security, multimedia processing, distributed computing, networking, and data structures. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.CR and cs.MM, followed by cs.DC, cs.NI, and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
