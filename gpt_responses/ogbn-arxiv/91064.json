The use of a public communication channel also suggests the possibility of channel coding (cs.CC) and signal processing (cs.SI) techniques being employed. Finally, the mention of an application to adder MAC suggests a possible connection to multimedia processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
