Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of depth cue, inter-image correspondence, and spatiotemporal constraint, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the evaluation datasets and quantitative measurements, which are related to multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
