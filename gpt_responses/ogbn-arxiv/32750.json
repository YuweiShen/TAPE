The method presented in the paper involves the use of Monte-Carlo algorithms, which are commonly used in numerical analysis and scientific computing (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the use of coordinate directions hit-and-run method, which is a technique used in optimization and linear programming (cs.DS). The reutilization of sample points is a technique used in machine learning and data analysis (cs.DM). Finally, the paper presents experimental results, which is a common theme in computer science theory and practice (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
