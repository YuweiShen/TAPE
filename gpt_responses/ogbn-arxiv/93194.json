The use of reinforcement learning (RL) to select appropriate tools from a toolbox of convolutional networks suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The joint learning scheme mentioned in the abstract indicates that the paper may also be relevant to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the use of small-scale convolutional networks suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the deep learning (cs.DL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
