The paper also discusses challenges for future research on Spectre attacks and mitigations, which are typical topics in the cs.CR sub-category.\n\nThe paper also touches on system-level issues (cs.SY) such as address-space layout randomization and cache eviction, which are relevant to the design and implementation of computer systems.\n\nThe paper discusses the use of covert channels (cs.SE) to leak information from a target system, which is a common technique in the field of side-channel attacks.\n\nThe paper also discusses the use of AVX instructions (cs.AR) to improve the performance of the covert channel, which is a topic related to computer architecture.\n\nFinally, the paper discusses the implementation of the attack using programming languages such as C and Python (cs.PL), which is relevant to the field of programming languages and compilers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
