Therefore, cs.RO (Robotics) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of vision-based quadrotors, which suggests a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV). The use of optimization techniques and motion planning algorithms suggests a possible connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with safety and dynamical feasibility, which suggests a possible connection to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
