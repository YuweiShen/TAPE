This involves incorporating physics knowledge into the model design and learning process. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) categories. Additionally, the paper involves using aggregate supervision to constrain the learning process, which could fall under the Control Engineering (cs.CE) category. The use of physics-based simulations and incorporating physical knowledge into the model design could also be relevant to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) and Systems and Control (cs.SI) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
