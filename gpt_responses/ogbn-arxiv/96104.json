The use of Coq proof assistant suggests a focus on formal verification and logic. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The paper also deals with reduction in lambda calculus, which falls under cs.PL (Programming Languages). The use of coinductive proof techniques suggests a possible connection to cs.TL (Term Rewriting), and the focus on formalisation suggests a possible connection to cs.LG (Logic in Artificial Intelligence) and cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
