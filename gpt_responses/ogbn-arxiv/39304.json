The use of product units in neural networks is a topic of interest in the field of neural engineering (cs.NE), as well as in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also presents results on the MNIST dataset, which is commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
