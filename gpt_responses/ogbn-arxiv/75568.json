The use of Bayesian optimisation also suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes an approach for generating saliency maps for black-box models, which could fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of natural language processing techniques to generate saliency maps could also place this paper in the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. Finally, the sampling-based approach used in the paper could suggest a Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
