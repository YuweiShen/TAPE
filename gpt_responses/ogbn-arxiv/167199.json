The paper also discusses the existence of a Nash equilibrium and derives closed-form analytical expressions of the equilibrium strategies. These are all topics that fall under the scope of game theory. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of analytical tools to model and analyze competitive resource allocation, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence. The proposed generalized game also enables the derivation of practical and implementable equilibrium strategies, which is relevant to the field of AI. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The Colonel Blotto game has been used to model competition in social and information networks, and the proposed generalization of the game may have applications in this area as well. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the tractability, applicability, and practicality challenges associated with mixed-strategies in the Colonel Blotto game, which are topics that fall under the scope of data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the heterogeneity of the battlefields and the consumption of resources in each battlefield, which are features that are not considered in the classical Blotto game.
