The paper also discusses the consensus protocol used to establish consensus among clusters on the order of cross-shard transactions. This fits well within the scope of distributed and cluster computing. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper discusses a permissioned blockchain system, which is a type of blockchain that restricts access to certain users or groups. This involves cryptographic techniques to ensure secure access control and data privacy. \n3. cs.DB (Databases) - The paper discusses the use of sharding to partition data in a blockchain system, which is similar to partitioning techniques used in databases. The paper also discusses the efficiency of SharPer in workloads with a low percentage of cross-shard transactions, which is a common consideration in partitioned databases. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the clustering of nodes in a blockchain system, which involves network architecture considerations such as communication between nodes and network latency. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper discusses the use of a directed acyclic graph to represent the blockchain ledger in SharPer, which is a data structure commonly used in algorithms for tasks"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
