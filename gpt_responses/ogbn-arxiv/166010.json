The main focus is on generating synthetic data to overcome the bottleneck of limited training data. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of neural networks and the importance of controlling appearance features, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of synthetic data to improve accuracy, which could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
