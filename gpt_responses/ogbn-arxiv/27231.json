The paper also mentions the use of auxiliary information, which suggests that it may fall under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR). The mention of modeling nonlinear relationships between users and items suggests that it may also fall under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep neural networks for computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) is also mentioned, which further supports the possibility of these categories. However, since the paper primarily focuses on the use of deep neural networks, it is most likely to fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
