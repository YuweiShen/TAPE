The approach is built upon a recently published algorithm called recurrent classifier (rClass) and uses a generalized recurrent network structure as a cognitive component. The paper discusses the limitations of traditional machine learning algorithms and proposes a self-regulating mechanism for selecting training samples and determining time instants to train a model. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the importance of tool condition monitoring in manufacturing processes, which suggests that it could belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The use of a recurrent network structure as a cognitive component suggests that it could also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the self-regulating mechanism for determining when to learn suggests that it could belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
