This falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The paper specifically deals with pruning the DNN model to reduce the transmission workload and computation workload, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of edge servers, which is a topic in distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
