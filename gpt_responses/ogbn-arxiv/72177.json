The proposed network architecture involves encoder-decoder networks, which are commonly used in deep learning-based image segmentation tasks, and hence, the paper could also be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of complementary pathway to extract features from non-brain regions, which involves training the network to learn from both brain and non-brain regions, and this could be related to neural networks (cs.NE) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
