It may also belong to \"cs.NE\" (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as it involves testing and comparing different TCP variants. Additionally, it could be categorized under \"cs.CR\" (Cryptography and Security) as network performance and fairness are important security concerns. \"cs.IT\" (Information Theory) and \"cs.DC\" (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) are also possible categories as the paper discusses the impact of parallel TCP schemes on bandwidth utilization and fairness."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
