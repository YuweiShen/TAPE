The paper also introduces a numerical categorization procedure, which is relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the software implementation of the algorithm, which is relevant to computer science and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
