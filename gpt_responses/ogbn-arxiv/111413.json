This makes it highly relevant to the sub-category of Logic in Computer Science.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - Epistemic logics are often used in artificial intelligence to model knowledge and belief. This paper's focus on nonstandard epistemic logics and its application to the \"knowing value\" logic makes it relevant to the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper's focus on nonstandard logics and its application to the \"knowing value\" logic may have implications for machine learning, particularly in the area of knowledge representation and reasoning.\n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper's exploration of the expressive power of the \"knowing value\" logic and its binary generalization may have implications for computational complexity theory.\n5. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper's use of Kripke models and its exploration of the semantics of the \"knowing value\" logic may have implications for programming language semantics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
