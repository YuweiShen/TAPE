The paper also mentions the importance of structure in the set of keys, such as hierarchy, order, or product space, which suggests that the paper may also belong to the data structures (cs.DS) category. The use of sampling schemes for approximate query answering is a common technique in machine learning (cs.AI) and statistics (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the use of variance optimal sampling schemes, which is a topic in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
