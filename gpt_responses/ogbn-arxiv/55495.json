The techniques used in the paper involve graph theory and combinatorics, which are also relevant to sub-categories such as cs.DS (data structures), cs.DM (discrete mathematics), and cs.GT (computational geometry and topology). Finally, the paper involves some numerical analysis, as it provides examples of non-spanning instances of Yao-Yao graphs, which could potentially fall under the sub-category cs.NA (numerical analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
