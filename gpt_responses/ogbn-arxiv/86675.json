The use of a stochastic decoder and the analysis of the power spectrum suggest that the paper may also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI). The discussion of critical rates and phase transitions may relate to the study of phase transitions in computer science (cs.DS). Finally, the optimization of input spectrum is a topic in network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
