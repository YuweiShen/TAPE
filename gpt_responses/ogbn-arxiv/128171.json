Additionally, the paper involves training a neural network to perform arithmetic, which suggests that it could also fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The use of neural networks also suggests that it could fall under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) category.
