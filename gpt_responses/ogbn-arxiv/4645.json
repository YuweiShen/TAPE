The paper proposes a new simulation metric called SPEC, which is used to modify a reach-avoid specification for the system into a more stringent specification for the abstraction. The paper also proposes a probabilistic method to compute SPEC for a general class of systems. The problem of synthesizing safe controllers for systems is a core problem in the field of control systems (cs.SY). The paper also deals with the simulation of quadrotors and autonomous cars, which are typical examples of robotic systems (cs.RO). The paper proposes a new simulation metric, which is a machine learning technique, to modify the specification for the system, which is a typical problem in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also uses probabilistic methods to compute SPEC, which is a typical problem in the field of statistics and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
