This is a topic related to systems and control. \n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of spatial-multiplexing gain in the IT channel, which is a topic related to multimedia. \n\n5. cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): Although the paper does not explicitly deal with multiagent systems, the proposed approach for constructing cancellation matrices involves using component vectors to null the signal from corresponding SWIPT interferers, which is a concept related to multiagent systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
