Additionally, the paper specifically addresses the challenges of non-stationary environments and exponentially increasing policy space in multiagent reinforcement learning (cs.MA), as well as the use of hierarchical frameworks (cs.RO) and experience replay mechanisms (cs.SY) to address these challenges. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.LG and cs.AI, followed by cs.MA, cs.RO, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
