The paper also discusses the concept of optimal signaling schemes, which is a common topic in game theory and economics. \n2. cs.NI (Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with network congestion games, which are a type of network optimization problem. The paper also discusses the role of a third-party entity (the sender) in improving the overall network experience. \n3. cs.IT (Computer Science - Information Theory): The paper discusses the use of information (in the form of signals) to improve the overall network experience. The paper also discusses the concept of optimal signaling schemes, which is a common topic in information theory. \n4. cs.SI (Computer Science - Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with network congestion games, which are a type of network optimization problem. The paper also discusses the role of a third-party entity (the sender) in improving the overall network experience. \n5. cs.DS (Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the computational complexity of computing optimal signaling schemes in different scenarios.
