The paper also discusses the issue of dependency between strings, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR). The use of Kolmogorov complexity to study randomness and independence is also relevant to the fields of data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
