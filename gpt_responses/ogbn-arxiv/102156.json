This task is closely related to natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR), which are covered by the cs.CL and cs.IR sub-categories. Additionally, the paper compares doc2vec to other document embedding methodologies, which falls under the scope of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of pre-trained word embeddings, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and NLP."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
