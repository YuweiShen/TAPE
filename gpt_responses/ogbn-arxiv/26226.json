The paper also investigates the trade-off between power consumption and occupied midhaul bandwidth. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also involves system-level optimization and control, which makes cs.SY (Systems and Control) a likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses caching techniques and content delivery, which are related to cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.AR (Hardware Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
