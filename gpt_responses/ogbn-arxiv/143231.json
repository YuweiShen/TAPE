The use of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy, a well-known technique in theoretical computer science for solving CSPs, suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the mention of approximation resistance and the strengthening of a previous result suggest that the paper may also be relevant to game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
