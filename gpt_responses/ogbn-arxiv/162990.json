This involves the use of algorithms such as PageRank, 2DRank, and CheiRank, which are commonly used in digital libraries research. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves the use of algorithms for ranking universities based on their Wikipedia pages, which can be seen as a form of information retrieval. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper analyzes the network of articles between 24 Wikipedia language editions to produce the ranking of world universities. This involves the study of social and information networks. \n- cs.SOC (Social and Economic Networks): The paper analyzes the historical development of university ranking over ten centuries, which can be seen as a study of social and economic networks. \n- cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity): Although not a major focus of the paper, the use of algorithms for ranking universities based on their Wikipedia pages could have implications for cybersecurity, particularly in terms of the accuracy and reliability of such rankings."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
