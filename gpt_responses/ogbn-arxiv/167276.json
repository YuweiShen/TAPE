The paper also extensively discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for this task, which is a popular method in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also addresses the issue of training and deployment of CNNs, which falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the integration of the framework with existing robotics codebases, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
