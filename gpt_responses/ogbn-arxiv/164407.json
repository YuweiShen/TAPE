This involves information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.MM) concepts. The paper also discusses the use of side information (cs.SI) and necessary conditions for transmission (cs.DS). Finally, the paper specializes the results for binary and Gaussian sources (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
