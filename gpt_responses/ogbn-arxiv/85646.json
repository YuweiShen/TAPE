The use of regular expressions and dictionaries suggests a focus on Natural Language Processing (cs.CL). The mention of \"web-scale\" and \"large scale\" extraction indicates a need for efficient and scalable algorithms, which could fall under Databases (cs.DB). The use of unsupervised learning techniques suggests a focus on Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
