This task falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The proposed method involves pre-training on auxiliary labels, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the method on multiple datasets, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
