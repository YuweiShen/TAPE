The use of semi-smoothness, a recent concept in optimization theory, suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The convergence results and analysis of equilibria in the paper may also be of interest to researchers in the subfields of data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the consideration of conflicts and coalitional deviations in the assignment games may make the paper relevant to the subfield of social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
