The approach is inspired by the information security literature on identifying malware distribution, phishing, and scam websites. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the sociotechnical problem of online disinformation and its impact on public discourse and democratic governance. The proposed approach aims to proactively discover disinformation websites, which can help mitigate the spread of false information on social and information networks. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of automated identification with distinctive non-perceptual infrastructure characteristics to support human judgments for early and scalable discovery of disinformation websites. This approach involves information retrieval techniques to analyze website characteristics. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper mentions natural language processing techniques used in previous research on detecting disinformation. Although the proposed approach does not explicitly use NLP, it could potentially be combined with NLP techniques to improve disinformation detection. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the societal impact of online disinformation and the need for effective countermeasures. The proposed approach aims to support early and scalable discovery of disinformation websites, which can help mitigate the negative societal impact of disinformation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
