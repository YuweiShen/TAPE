The paper also draws on insights from existing HRI work around topics like touch, proxemics, gaze, and moral norms, which suggests that it could also be categorized under human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper proposes using legal scholarship to guide how robotic systems might cultivate and sustain proper forms of consent, which could be seen as an application of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and social intelligence (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses empirical and technical questions related to consent challenges faced in major application domains and robotic roles, which could be seen as a form of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
