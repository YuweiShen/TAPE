This involves the use of software-defined radio (SDR) platforms and antenna arrays, which are typically studied in the computer networks and communications (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of system-level simulations based on a 3D ray-tracing tool, which falls under the information theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of smart small cell systems, which can be considered as a multimedia (cs.MM) application. The implementation of the system involves the use of hardware and software components, which can be studied under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the use of beamforming techniques, which can be studied under the computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.AR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
