It discusses the implementation of a generalised form of Remote Procedure Call and the addition of features necessary for more efficient execution. The technical results have been formalised and proved correct in Agda, and a prototype compiler has been developed. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is cs.PL (Programming Languages) as the paper deals with the implementation of higher-order programs. The paper also discusses distributed architectures, which makes cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) a likely sub-category. The addition of features necessary for more efficient execution makes cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) a possible sub-category. The paper also discusses the operational semantics of the system, which makes cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the correctness of the system, which makes cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
