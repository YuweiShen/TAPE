The paper also mentions the use of established methods like AdaBoost, SVM, Lasso, Elastic Net, and FoBa, which are commonly used in the subfields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The datasets used in the paper are related to computer vision tasks, such as the Youtube-Objects dataset of videos and the MNIST digits dataset. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
