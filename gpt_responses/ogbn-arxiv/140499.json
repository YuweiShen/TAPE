The first selection lemma is a fundamental result in computational geometry, which suggests that the paper could be categorized under cs.CG. The second part of the paper deals with a new type of selection lemma in $\\Re^d$, which is also related to computational geometry. The third part of the paper extends the weak $\\frac{1}{r}$-net theorem to a kinetic setting, which involves control theory and system dynamics, suggesting that the paper could also be categorized under cs.SY.
