The use of deep learning techniques also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also deals with control systems, which could place it in the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The use of reinforcement learning and optimal control methods suggests that it could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of deep differential networks and the focus on learning value functions suggests that it could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
