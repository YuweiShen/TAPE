Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of motion compensation, which falls under the sub-category of cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, the paper proposes novel algorithms that rely on end-to-end training, which is a common theme in the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper involves the joint processing of multiple frames, which could be considered a form of video processing and thus falls under the sub-category of cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
