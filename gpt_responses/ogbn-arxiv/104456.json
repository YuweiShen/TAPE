The use of bridge rules for interoperability of reasoning between triples in various contexts suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and logical reasoning (cs.LO). The adaptation of the chase algorithm for deciding query entailment is a technique commonly used in software engineering (cs.SE) for database management. Finally, the paper discusses the complexity of query entailment, which is a topic in computational complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
