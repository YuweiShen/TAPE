The paper also mentions the vulnerability of classifiers to attacks, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR). The proposed Cross-Lipschitz regularization functional is a method for improving the robustness of classifiers, which falls under the category of regularization techniques in machine learning (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of kernel methods and neural networks, which are common techniques in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
