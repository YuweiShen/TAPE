This involves processing signals from multiple transmit and receive antennas to recover continuous angle-delay-Doppler triplets. The approach proposed in the paper involves solving a convex optimization problem, which falls under the category of signal processing and optimization. Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves applications in signal processing, control systems, and machine learning, which are covered by cs.SI (Systems and Control), cs.SY (Machine Learning), and cs.LG (Learning). Additionally, the paper involves processing of radar images, which falls under the category of computer vision, covered by cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
