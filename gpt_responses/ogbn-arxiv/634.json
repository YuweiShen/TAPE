This falls under the category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL). The use of multiple specialized sub-agents and a meta-agent for aggregation suggests the use of coordination and collaboration among agents, which falls under the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The method also involves training on disjoint partitions of the data, which suggests the use of parallelization and distributed computing, falling under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
