The paper proposes a new method for optimizing text quantifiers using a supervised learning model for structured prediction. This method is evaluated through experiments on high-dimensional datasets, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers papers related to the development and analysis of machine learning algorithms and models, which is the main focus of this paper. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category covers papers related to natural language processing and computational linguistics, which are relevant to the text mining applications of quantification discussed in the paper. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category covers papers related to the retrieval of information from large collections of data, which is relevant to the data mining applications of quantification discussed in the paper. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers papers related to the development and analysis of intelligent agents and systems, which is relevant to the supervised learning model used in this paper. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category covers papers related to computer vision and image processing, which may be relevant to some of the applications of quantification discussed in the paper (e.g., analyzing images or videos)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
