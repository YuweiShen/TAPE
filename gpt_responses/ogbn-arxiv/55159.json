The model utilizes a generative Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) for stroke-based symbol reconstruction, which falls under the CV and AI subfields. The paper also mentions the use of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network, which is a type of machine learning algorithm, further supporting the AI subfield. The proposed model aims to improve algorithms for stylization, deformation, morphing, and animation of 2D drawings, which could be relevant to graphics (GR) and human-computer interaction (HC) subfields. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.AI, followed by cs.LG, cs.GR, and cs.HC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
