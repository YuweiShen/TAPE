Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with security and cryptography, which suggests cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) as another likely category. The use of a helper and the cooperative jamming signal also suggest the possibility of the paper belonging to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the use of noise removal and signal separation techniques suggests the possibility of the paper belonging to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
