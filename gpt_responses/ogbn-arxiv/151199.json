This involves the use of deep learning techniques, which are commonly associated with computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of data augmentation techniques and the practical deployment of the detection network, which are relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also discusses the use of tiling approaches to operate over orchard data, which is relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
