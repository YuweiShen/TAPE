The paper proposes a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture for sea-land segmentation, which falls under the category of graphics (cs.GR). The paper also discusses the performance of the network and compares it with other architectures, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
