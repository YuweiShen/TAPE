The paper also uses decision-theoretic planning under uncertainty and information-theoretic approaches, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the performance of the exploration policy, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Lastly, the paper mentions mapping the hotspot field, which could involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
