Robotics (RO) is also relevant as it involves the use of robotic hands and human-robot interaction. Human-computer interaction (HC) is another relevant sub-category as it involves the use of hands for interacting with computers. Multimedia (MM) is also relevant as it involves the use of hands in virtual and augmented reality applications. Graphics (GR) is also relevant as it involves the use of hands in animation and motion capture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
