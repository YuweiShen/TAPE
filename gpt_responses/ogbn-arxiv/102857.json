The paper also discusses the stability condition of these codes over the binary erasure channel (BEC), which is a topic related to coding theory and communication complexity (cs.CC). The analysis of the growth rate of the weight distribution involves the use of graph theory and combinatorics, which are topics related to discrete mathematics (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the stopping set size distribution of these codes, which is a topic related to network information theory (cs.SI) and network coding (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
