The paper also discusses a mode-declaration scheme for reducing the size of fixed point solutions, which is related to logic and computation (cs.LO) as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper mentions dynamic programming, which is a topic in algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the fixed point computation engine in a commercial Prolog system, which is related to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
