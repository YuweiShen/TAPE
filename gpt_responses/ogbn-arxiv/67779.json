This involves defining a discriminant function that maximizes the sum of relevance scores and dissimilarities among documents, using relevance and diversity features. The paper is therefore likely to belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category, as well as Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) sub-categories, given the use of learning frameworks and features. Additionally, the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-categories, as these fields often involve search and ranking systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
