The use of stable sets and independent transversals suggests that the paper may belong to the Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) or Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. The focus on cliques and partitions of graphs suggests that it may also belong to the Graph Theory (cs.GT) or Computational Geometry (cs.CG) sub-categories.
