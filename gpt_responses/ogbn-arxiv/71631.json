The use of curvilinear homography and line-level dewarping suggests a focus on computer vision techniques, which is why cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The use of metrics to evaluate the quality of the dewarping process suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The use of datasets and OCR accuracy suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.DL) and multimedia (cs.MM) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
