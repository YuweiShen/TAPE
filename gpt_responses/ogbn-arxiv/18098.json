The use of quantization in the channel output is a common technique in multimedia communication (cs.MM) to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. The cutting-plane algorithm mentioned in the abstract is a well-known optimization technique in signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the use of power constraints, which is a common consideration in networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper uses numerical optimization, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
