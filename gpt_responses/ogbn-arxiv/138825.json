The paper proposes a new method called Monte-Carlo tree search for policy optimization (MCTSPO) that combines Monte-Carlo tree search and gradient-free optimization. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses the use of MCTSPO in control systems (cs.SY) and neural networks (cs.NE), which are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
