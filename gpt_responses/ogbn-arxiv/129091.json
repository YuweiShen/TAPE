The paper also discusses the use of neural networks for this purpose, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the optimization of the likelihood of the latent representation of images, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the use of empirical risk minimization, which is a common technique in neural networks and machine learning (cs.NE).
