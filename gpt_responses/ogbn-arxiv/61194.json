This involves the use of mathematical models and algorithms to optimize multiple aspects of clinical care. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): This sub-category deals with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use. The paper's focus on decision support tools at the clinician level and the use of EHR data to improve clinical productivity aligns with this sub-category.\n- cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity and Privacy): This sub-category deals with the protection of computer systems and networks from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or disruption. While the paper does not explicitly discuss cybersecurity or privacy, the use of EHR data raises concerns about data security and privacy, making this sub-category relevant.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): This sub-category deals with the application of computational methods and tools to solve problems in engineering, finance, and science. The paper's use of mathematical models and algorithms to optimize clinical care aligns with this sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category deals with the study and development of intelligent agents that can perceive their environment and take"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
