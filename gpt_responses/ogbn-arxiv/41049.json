The paper also discusses geometric properties related to the minimization problems, which could fall under computational geometry (cs.CG) or numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper could also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SP) as divergences are used in various signal processing applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
