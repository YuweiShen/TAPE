The use of auxiliary data and preprocessing techniques is a common approach to speed up the computation of shortest paths. Therefore, the paper could belong to several sub-categories, such as cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). However, given the focus on graph algorithms and data structures, cs.DS is the most likely sub-category. The use of nested dissection orders and the experimental analysis on large road and game maps also suggest a connection to cs.CG. The use of machine learning techniques is not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, but it could be relevant to the customization phase. Finally, the use of graphs and networks is relevant to cs.SI, but it is less likely to be the main focus of the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
