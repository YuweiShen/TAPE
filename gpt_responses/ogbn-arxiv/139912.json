This could be of interest to researchers in machine learning who work on outlier detection and robust statistics. \n4. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper's focus on aligning two point sets is relevant to computer graphics, where registration is important for tasks such as shape matching and animation. \n5. cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper's use of the ICP algorithm and distance measures for point set alignment is relevant to computational geometry, which deals with algorithms and data structures for geometric problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
