The focus on structured applied epistemology suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG), as these fields often involve knowledge representation and reasoning. The consideration of highly-structured descriptions of historical events suggests a connection to natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the use of Basic Formal Ontology suggests a connection to deep learning (cs.DL), which often involves the use of structured representations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
