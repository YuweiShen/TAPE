It also involves learning formulations, which suggests it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The use of covariant constraints in the loss function suggests it could also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) category. Finally, the mention of experiments suggests it could belong to the robotics (cs.RO) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
