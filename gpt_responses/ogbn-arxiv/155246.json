The paper proposes a symbolic model approach to the control design with objectives expressed in terms of non-deterministic transition systems. This approach is based on recent advances in symbolic control design of continuous and hybrid systems. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.SY (Systems and Control), which deals with the theory and applications of systems and control. \n\nThe paper also includes an example in the context of robot motion planning with remote control, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category. \n\nThe non-ideal behaviors of the communication network, such as variable sampling/transmission intervals, communication delays, packet losses, communication constraints, and quantization errors, indicate that the paper could also belong to the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) sub-category. \n\nThe paper proposes a symbolic model approach to the control design, which involves the use of information theory and coding theory.
