The authors also explore parallels between incomplete contracting and AI alignment, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses technical results from the economics literature on incomplete contracts, which suggests that it may be relevant to the subfield of computational economics (cs.CE). The paper also touches on the issue of security and trust in AI systems, which suggests that it may be relevant to the subfield of cybersecurity (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a research agenda for AI alignment work, which suggests that it may be relevant to the subfield of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
