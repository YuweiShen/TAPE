This involves the use of Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) principle to minimize the probability of an eavesdropper to recover relevant portions of sensor data. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Other likely sub-categories include cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
