This falls under the domain of computer vision and pattern recognition. \n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval) - The paper discusses the collection and analysis of signature data, which can be considered as a form of information retrieval. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The authors propose different training and testing setups for signature verification systems, which involves the use of machine learning algorithms. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - Signature verification is an important aspect of cryptography and security, and the paper discusses the creation of a new dataset for this purpose. \n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - The paper also discusses the cultural aspects of Persian signatures and how they differ from other signature datasets. This can be considered as a form of human-computer interaction research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
