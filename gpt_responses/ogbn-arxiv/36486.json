The paper also discusses the activation functions used in neural networks, which is a topic related to \"Neural and Evolutionary Computing\" (cs.NE) and \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). The paper also applies the framework to study the capacity of neural networks to learn connected regions in computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
