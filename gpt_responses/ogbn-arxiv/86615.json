Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related topics. The paper also proposes a novel soft loss function, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The problem of predicting sememes can also be seen as an information retrieval (IR) task (cs.IR) since it involves finding relevant information from unstructured textual data. Additionally, the use of deep learning models for this task falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
