The use of sub-linear time decoding suggests a focus on algorithms and data structures (cs.DS), while the need for numerical optimization techniques implies a connection to numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the extension of results for information-theoretically bounded adversaries suggests a possible connection to security and cryptography (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
