The paper discusses the importance of service deployment at the edge and proposes a solution for it. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper deals with the deployment and scheduling of microservices, which is a software engineering problem. It also mentions the use of container technologies, which is a software engineering concept. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper formulates a stochastic optimization problem to decide how microservices should be scheduled and deployed, which involves making decisions in a dynamic and uncertain environment. This is a systems and control problem. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper mentions the use of Kubernetes, which is a container orchestration platform that uses declarative configuration files written in YAML. This involves a programming language concept."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
