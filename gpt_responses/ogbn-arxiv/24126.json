The use of power functions and exponential sums suggests a connection to algebraic geometry and number theory, which are also relevant to coding theory and cryptography, and could place the paper in categories such as cs.DS (discrete mathematics) or cs.CC (computational complexity). Finally, the study of weight distributions and code properties could have applications in signal processing and communication systems, which could lead to a classification in cs.SI (signal and image processing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
