This involves learning the \"forget\" and \"input\" gates in the ConvLSTM cell from quality-related features to make the information of each frame reasonably and adequately used. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM), as the paper deals with video quality enhancement using deep learning. The paper also involves learning from quality-related features, which suggests that it may fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
