The authors also introduce a new dataset, which involves data collection and curation, and hence could be classified under machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The proposed method involves joint learning of super-resolution and identity, which could be classified under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves extensive experiments and evaluation of the proposed method, which could be classified under information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
