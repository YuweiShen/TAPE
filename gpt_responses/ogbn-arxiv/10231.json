It also discusses the limitations of existing cluster scheduling disciplines and proposes a new notion of finish-time fairness. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as it deals with ML workloads and proposes a new scheduling framework to improve their efficiency and fairness. \n\nThe System and Control (cs.SY) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper discusses the use of a central arbiter to run an auction for available resources. \n\nFinally, the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category is a possibility as the paper deals with ML training workloads that use GPUs, which are commonly used in neural network training."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
