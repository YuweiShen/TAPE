The paper specifically focuses on image classification, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The use of active learning and zero-shot classifiers suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of natural language processing techniques, which falls under computational linguistics (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
