The experiments involve multiple modalities (MM) such as audio and video, which are commonly used in CV tasks. The paper also discusses overfitting and optimization strategies (SD), which are important topics in machine learning. Finally, the tasks mentioned in the paper, such as human action recognition and acoustic event detection, are commonly studied in natural language processing (CL) and CV. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CV and cs.LG, followed by cs.MM, cs.SD, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
