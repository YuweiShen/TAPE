Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses resource management, network architectures, and mobility management, which are related to distributed computing (cs.DC) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions privacy-aware MEC, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the standardization efforts on MEC, which is related to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
