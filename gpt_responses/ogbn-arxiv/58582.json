It also mentions the use of acquisition functions, which are commonly used in optimization problems in machine learning. Additionally, the paper proposes a portfolio of acquisition functions, which is a strategy commonly used in machine learning to improve performance. \n\nThe paper could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as Bayesian optimization is a popular technique in AI research. \n\nThe neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category is also a possibility as Gaussian processes are a type of neural network. \n\nThe systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category is a possibility as the paper discusses optimization, which is a common problem in control systems. \n\nFinally, the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category is a possibility as the paper discusses the use of online multi-armed bandit strategies, which are a type of algorithm commonly used in optimization problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
