Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new CNN model, which involves deep learning (DL), making cs.DL another likely sub-category. The creation of a new annotation dataset involves multimedia (MM) techniques, making cs.MM a possible sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of image retrieval (IR) techniques to solve the assignment problem, making cs.IR another possible sub-category. Finally, the use of CNNs involves artificial intelligence (AI), making cs.AI a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
