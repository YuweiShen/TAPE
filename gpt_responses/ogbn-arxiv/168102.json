This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) and could also be related to software engineering (cs.SD) as the proposed techniques involve calibration and obfuscation. The paper also mentions the use of audio stimulation, which could be related to multimedia (cs.MM) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper discusses the tracking of users across applications and websites, which could be related to cybercrime (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
