Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of reduced precision and large batch training, which are optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories as well. The paper also mentions the use of GPUs for training, which falls under the category of computer vision (CV), making cs.CV a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the results of experiments and benchmarks, which could also fall under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
