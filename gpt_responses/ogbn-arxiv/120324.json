The paper also mentions the use of onboard sensors and data exchange between vehicles, which suggests the involvement of computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and robotics (cs.RO) in the proposed solution. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of active learning, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
