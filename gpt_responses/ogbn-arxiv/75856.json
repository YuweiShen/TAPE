It proposes a domain-specific modelling language and an Eclipse plug-in for synthesising annotation processors. The paper focuses on the design and validation of software projects, which suggests that it belongs to the Programming Languages (cs.PL), Software Engineering (cs.SE), and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses a real set of annotations from the Java Persistence API (JPA), which suggests that it could also belong to the Databases (cs.DB) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a new modelling language, which could also be relevant to the Computer Engineering (cs.CE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
