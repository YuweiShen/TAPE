The paper also proposes a new decoding algorithm that involves local optimization, which falls under the scope of social and information networks (cs.SI) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DS) sub-categories. Finally, the paper presents simulation results that demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed algorithm, which is relevant to the computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
