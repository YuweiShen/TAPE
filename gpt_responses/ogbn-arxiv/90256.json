The use of lattice reduction and sampling techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DS). The proposed algorithm may have applications in signal processing (cs.SI) and network information theory (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
