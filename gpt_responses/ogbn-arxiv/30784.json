Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) since the authors use multiple image datasets. The paper also discusses techniques for improving learning, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper uses deep neural networks, which is a subfield of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper discusses the effect of label noise on the dataset size required for successful training, which is related to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
