The paper specifically focuses on the use of sparse models for regularizing blind deconvolution to promote signal identifiability. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.SP (Signal Processing). Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of sparse models in image processing (cs.CV) and the application of the methods to a second-hop channel estimation problem (cs.MM). Finally, the paper establishes negative results on the sparsity-ambiguity trade-off scaling laws, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
