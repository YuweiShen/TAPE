Therefore, it is likely to belong to the cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) and cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper focuses on the data structure and algorithms used in the design, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of Block RAMs (BRAMs) architecture, which is related to the cs.ET (Embedded Systems) sub-category. Finally, the paper presents techniques to decrease stalling rates, which could be related to the cs.PL (Programming Languages) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
