The use of machine learning-based classification and derivative-based features also suggests a connection to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The implementation and evaluation of the system in a cloud-based setting may also relate to the sub-category of cloud computing (cs.CY). The use of inertial measurement units (IMUs) and the exploration of derivative-based features may also suggest a connection to the sub-category of data compression (cs.DC). Finally, the overall system design and evaluation may also relate to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
