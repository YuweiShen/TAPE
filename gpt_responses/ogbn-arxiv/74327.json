It proposes a standard XML format that every serialized object should follow, which makes it possible to use objects of heterogeneous databases seamlessly using XML. \n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the replication of data between different data repositories, which involves distributed computing. \n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes an integrated approach for extraction of objects from XML and transformation to heterogeneous object-oriented databases, which involves software engineering principles. \n4. cs.DL (Digital Libraries): The paper discusses the transformation of data from Web-resident databases, which is relevant to digital libraries. \n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper proposes a standard XML format that every serialized object should follow, which can be useful for information retrieval systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
