The paper presents a practical adversarial learning technique called MaskDGA that adds perturbation to the character-level representation of algorithmically generated domain names in order to evade DGA classifiers, without the attacker having any knowledge about the DGA classifier's architecture and parameters. This work involves the use of deep learning and machine learning techniques, which are commonly associated with the sub-categories of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper deals with the topic of network security, which is associated with the sub-categories of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SE (Software Engineering). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CR, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.NI, and cs.SE, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
