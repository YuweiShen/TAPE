The use of deep LSTM reader system and feature-engineered approach with semantics suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The proposed L2R reader system also indicates the use of information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques. Additionally, the use of news article dataset suggests the involvement of computer vision (cs.CV) in text analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
