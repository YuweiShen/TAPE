It also involves modeling and inference on graphs, which is a common topic in network science (cs.NI) and statistical inference (cs.SI). The paper proposes a new algorithmic solution, which falls under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method using numerical simulations, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
