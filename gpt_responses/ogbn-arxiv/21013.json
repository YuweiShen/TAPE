The use of cross-complementary pairs (CCPs) is a novel approach to this problem, which could also be relevant to signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI). Finally, the paper mentions the validation of the proposed approach through simulation, which suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
