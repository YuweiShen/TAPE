Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also deals with privacy-friendly face localization, which could fall under cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), or cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper uses HEVC syntax to localize faces, which could also fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
