The use of models and algorithms for efficient query processing also falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also proposes a set of primitives for efficiently describing correlation, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS). The use of Apache Spark and Apache Cassandra suggests a focus on distributed computing (cs.DC).
