It may also belong to cs.SE (Software Engineering) as it discusses automated detection approaches. Additionally, the paper mentions collaboration between apps, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as these fields deal with analyzing and processing data. Finally, the paper's co-operation with Intel Security suggests it may also belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
