The use of statistical combining techniques and the impact of different propagation conditions on system performance suggest that the paper could also be relevant to Signal Processing (cs.SI) and Multimedia (cs.MM) subfields. Finally, the study of the optimal number of training symbols and the analysis of the impact of pilot contamination on system performance suggest that the paper could also be relevant to the Communications (cs.COM) subfield."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
