This involves analyzing functions annotated with pre- and post-conditions using an automatic theorem prover. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves analyzing code expressions, which suggests that it may also belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The use of deductive verification also suggests that the paper may belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. The paper also involves detecting errors, which suggests that it may belong to the Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-category. Finally, the use of an automatic theorem prover suggests that the paper may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
