The paper proposes a novel method for determining the configuration of 2D-3D geometric constraints, which involves designing a viewpoint classifier using a multi-branch CNN. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CVPR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
