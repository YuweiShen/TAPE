This approach involves leveraging a user's domain expertise and developing a distance measure between signals through the lens of a monotonic specification. This work is likely to be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), data structures (cs.DS), software engineering (cs.SE), and social and information networks (cs.SI) who are interested in developing new techniques for time-series analysis and learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
