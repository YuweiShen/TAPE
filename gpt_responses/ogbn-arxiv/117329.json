This involves learning from new data and modifying the network structure accordingly. This topic is closely related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG), as well as data management (cs.DB) and information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of scoring functions for learning Bayesian networks, which is a common technique in statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
