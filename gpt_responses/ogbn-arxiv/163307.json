The proposed method involves iterative low-rank approximation, which is a technique used in various areas of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of the approach on specific tasks such as object detection, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
