The paper uses sentiment analysis and network analysis to study the interactions among users and to find groups of users who support voting 'yes' or 'no' in the referendum. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SOC (Computational Social Science). Additionally, the paper uses natural language processing techniques to obtain sentiment from tweets, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the potential applications of its findings in opinion dynamics, public opinion modelling, and polling, which could place it in cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity) or cs.DL (Digital Libraries)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
