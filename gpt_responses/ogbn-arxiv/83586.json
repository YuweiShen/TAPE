The paper also discusses the efficiency of the new construction, which involves analyzing the expected number of hash collisions, a topic that falls under information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper mentions the application of LSH-based similarity search in computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
