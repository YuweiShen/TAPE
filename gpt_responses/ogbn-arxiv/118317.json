The paper discusses the challenges of low-resolution face recognition and proposes practical approaches to handle them. The paper also evaluates super-resolution methods, face re-identification, and low-resolution face identification. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
