Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves mathematical modeling and analysis of the cooperative probability and coverage probability, which suggests the possibility of it belonging to cs.IT (Information Theory) or cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). The proposed evaluation metrics for vehicular mobility performance indicate the potential relevance to cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
