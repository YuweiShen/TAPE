The paper also proposes a framework for dealing with noisy-labeled data, which is a common problem in machine learning, and thus falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The proposed method involves uncertainty sampling and sample re-weighting, which are techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also validates the proposed method on skin lesion classification, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) related to medical imaging."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
