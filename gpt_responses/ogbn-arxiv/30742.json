Therefore, cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses deep reinforcement learning to approximate both the Q-function and the policy, which falls under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The agents being controlled are robots, which suggests cs.RO (Robotics) as another possible sub-category. The paper also deals with policy evaluation, which is a topic in cs.LG (Machine Learning). Finally, the paper deals with distributed partial observability of the state, which is a topic in cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
