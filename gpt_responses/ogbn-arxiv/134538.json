This involves information theory concepts such as channel capacity and error probability, making cs.IT the most likely category.\n2. cs.COMM (Communication and Networking): The paper deals with fiber-optical channels, which is a communication and networking topic. \n3. cs.OH (Optimization and Control): The paper proposes a low-complexity detector, which involves optimization and control techniques to reduce complexity.\n4. cs.PHYS (Physics): The paper deals with fiber-optical channels, which is a physics topic. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes a detector that uses simple straight-line decision boundaries, which involves data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
