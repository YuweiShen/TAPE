However, since the paper focuses on algebraic and polynomial methods, we believe that the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (discrete structures) and cs.CC (computational complexity), followed by cs.LO (linear and nonlinear programming), cs.SY (control theory), and cs.SC (scientific computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
