The paper also proposes a set of hybrid human-machine methods and tools for describing and explaining system failures, which involves human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The evaluation of machine learning systems is also a topic in the fields of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and natural language processing (cs.CL), which are all relevant to the case study presented in the paper on image captioning. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI, cs.HC, cs.LG, cs.CV, and cs.CL, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
