The paper focuses on the performance and security tradeoffs of these schemes. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses security issues, which makes cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the design of CCN architectures, which could fall under cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper proposes accounting strategies that entail a few simple requirements for CCN architectures, which could fall under cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
