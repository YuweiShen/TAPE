This is a problem that is primarily relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also proposes a novel framework for achieving this, which involves a global gater network, which is a technique that falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves extensive experimentation with image datasets, which is another indication that it belongs to the computer vision subfield. Finally, the paper also involves some discussion of potential interpretability of model behavior, which is a topic that falls under natural language processing (cs.CL) as well as machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
