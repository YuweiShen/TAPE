The use of automorphisms and module theory suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the algebraic combinatorics (cs.CC) and group theory (cs.GT) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses criteria for determining if a code is projective, which may be of interest to researchers in the cryptography (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
