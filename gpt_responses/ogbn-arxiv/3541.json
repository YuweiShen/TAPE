The paper also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it uses active learning to select informative samples. Computer vision (cs.CV) is another likely sub-category as the paper evaluates the proposed approach on image classification tasks. Natural language processing (cs.CL) is less likely but still possible as the proposed approach could potentially be applied to text classification tasks. Finally, neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) is also a possible sub-category as the paper involves training deep neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
