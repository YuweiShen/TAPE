The paper also discusses the impact of communication delays and straggling computations on the performance of federated learning, which is related to the field of cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel coded computing technique to mitigate the impact of stragglers, which is related to the field of cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also discusses the potential applications of the proposed technique in wireless edge computing, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper discusses the potential impact of the proposed technique on network infrastructure and communication protocols, which is related to the field of cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
