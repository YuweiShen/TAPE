The paper discusses the limitations of current choreography language models and proposes a new model that includes reusable choreographic procedures, parameterised on the processes they use, and combines general recursion with the ability to create new processes at runtime. The paper also discusses the typing discipline and the EndPoint Projection (EPP) of the proposed model. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories are:\n\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper proposes a new language model for developing concurrent software, which involves the design of choreographies. The paper discusses the limitations of current choreography language models and proposes a new model that includes reusable choreographic procedures, parameterised on the processes they use, and combines general recursion with the ability to create new processes at runtime. This fits well with the scope of cs.PL.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the EndPoint Projection (EPP) of the proposed model, which synthesises a correct-by-construction distributed implementation in a process calculus. This fits well with the scope of cs.DC.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses the benefits of choreographies for developing concurrent software that is correct by construction. This fits well with the scope of cs.SE.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
