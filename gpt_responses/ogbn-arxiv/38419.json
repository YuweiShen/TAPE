It may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as it proposes a new reward shaping method for deep reinforcement learning. The System and Control (cs.SY) sub-category is also a possibility as it deals with system uncertainty in the learning process. Finally, the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) sub-category may also be relevant as it involves state representation modeling."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
