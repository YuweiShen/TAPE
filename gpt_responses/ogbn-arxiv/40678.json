The use of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture also suggests a potential fit with the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on generating logical forms from text and entities could also be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
