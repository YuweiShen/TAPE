The authors also mention the successful modeling of cognitive experiments, which suggests the use of machine learning techniques (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the deviations from classical, logical, and probabilistic structures, which could be related to computational complexity (cs.CC). The authors use mathematical formalism to describe their quantum-theoretic perspective, which could fall under programming languages (cs.PL) or cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
