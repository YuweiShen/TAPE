The paper also introduces a formal framework for describing server contract monitoring, which involves the use of programming languages (cs.PL). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential security implications of contract monitoring, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the use of runtime verification, which involves the use of distributed computing (cs.DC).
