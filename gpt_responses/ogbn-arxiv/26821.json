This is a common problem in machine learning and statistics, and the paper's approach is likely to be of interest to researchers in several sub-fields of computer science. Based on the abstract, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.ST (Statistics). The paper's use of stochastic gradient methods suggests that it may also be relevant to researchers in cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
