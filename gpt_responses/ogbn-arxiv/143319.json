The paper proposes a faster algorithm for handling small batches of queries, which is likely to be of interest to researchers working in the area of data structures and algorithms. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also involves some aspects of combinatorics and discrete mathematics (cs.DM), as well as computational complexity (cs.CC) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper proposes an adaptation of the Sparse Table technique, which is a well-known algorithmic technique used in many areas of computer science, including algorithms (cs.AL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
