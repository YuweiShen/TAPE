Additionally, the paper discusses the functionality and redundancy of convolutional filters, which are specific to CNNs. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning techniques, which makes it likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. \n\nNeural Networks (cs.NE) is another likely sub-category as the paper deals with pruning convolutional filters in a neural network. \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the interpretation of filter functionality, which involves natural language processing techniques.
