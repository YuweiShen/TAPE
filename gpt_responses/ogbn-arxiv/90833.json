The proposed architecture is also focused on flexibility and reconfigurability, which are important aspects of robotics systems.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a model-driven development approach for engineering assembly systems, which is a software engineering methodology. The use of a domain-specific engineering tool also aligns with software engineering practices.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the engineering of evolvable flexible hybrid assembly systems, which involve the integration of multiple subsystems and control mechanisms. This aligns with the focus of the systems and control sub-category.\n- cs.EM (Embedded Systems): The paper builds upon a previous work that defined a SOA-based framework for embedded industrial automation systems. The proposed architecture for assembly systems can also be considered as an embedded system.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper mentions the use of web technologies, IoT, cloud computing, and big data, which are all related to the societal impact of computing. The proposed architecture can also be seen as a way to improve the efficiency and sustainability of assembly systems, which has societal implications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
