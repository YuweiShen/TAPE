The paper also discusses power allocation and optimization, which is a common topic in information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper proposes frameworks for joint data and energy transfer, which can be considered as a control systems problem (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of multimedia applications (cs.MM) and mathematical optimization techniques (cs.MA) in their evaluation studies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
