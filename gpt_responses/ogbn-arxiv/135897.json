The paper also proposes a novel probabilistic approach, which involves incorporating prior shape information and formulating distributions over predicted surface vertex positions, indicating a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of principal component analysis (PCA) also suggests a potential fit for neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with the task of organ delineation, which falls under the category of graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
