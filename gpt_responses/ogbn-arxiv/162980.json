This involves probabilistic modeling and efficient MCMC algorithm. The problem is demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world data arising in general object recognition. Based on these factors, the most likely sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves statistical modeling and inference, which suggests sub-categories of statistics (cs.ST) and computational linguistics (cs.CL) as possible options."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
