The paper also discusses the complexity of the graph class, which is a topic in theoretical computer science (cs.DS). The application of the results to power system test cases suggests a connection to systems and control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the use of Gaussian IID measurements suggests a connection to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
