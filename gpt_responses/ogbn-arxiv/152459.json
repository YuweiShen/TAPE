Therefore, it is likely to belong to the categories of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper also discusses adaptive traffic control systems and their theoretical approaches, which falls under the category of cs.SY (Systems and Control). The proposed system also incorporates wireless vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, which involves artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
