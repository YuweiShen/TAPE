This involves addressing issues of increasing parallelism, minimizing communication, constraining memory footprint, and ensuring good load balance. These topics are typically covered in the following arXiv CS sub-categories: Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Databases (cs.DB), Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE), and Numerical Analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
