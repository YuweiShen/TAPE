This encoding permits easier visualisation of the fitness landscape arbitrary problems by providing a way to map fitness against a single dimension. The paper also mentions the use of search meta-heuristics such as Differential Evolution. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.GP (Genetic Programming). Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
