The paper also discusses the use of randomization techniques in neural networks, which is a common approach in the subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the vulnerability of neural networks to attacks, which is a topic commonly studied in the subfield of computer security (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the use of neural networks in image classification tasks, which is a common application in the subfield of computer vision (cs.CV).
