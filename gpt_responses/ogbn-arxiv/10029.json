The paper also discusses the complexity reductions achieved by the proposed algorithm, which is a key topic in the field of data structures and algorithms. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the use of cyclotomic fast Fourier transforms (CFFTs) in information theory applications, and proposes a method to reduce the additive complexities of CFFTs. Information theory is concerned with the transmission, processing, and storage of information, and CFFTs are widely used in signal processing and data compression, which are important topics in information theory. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of CFFTs in control systems, which are used to analyze and design feedback control systems. The proposed method to reduce the additive complexities of CFFTs can be useful in designing control systems with better performance and lower computational cost. \n4. cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper proposes a novel common subexpression elimination algorithm, which is a key technique in symbolic computation. Symbolic computation is concerned with the manipulation of mathematical expressions and algorithms, and common subexpression elimination is a fundamental technique in optimizing symbolic computations. \n5. cs.NA (Numerical"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
