Specifically, it focuses on using Mask R-CNN for lesion detection, which is a popular object detection model in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also proposes a strategy for generating pseudo masks for lesions, which can be considered as a form of data augmentation or pre-processing (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses a hard negative example mining strategy, which is a technique for reducing false positives in object detection (cs.MM). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on a large-scale medical imaging dataset, which involves information retrieval and medical image analysis (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
