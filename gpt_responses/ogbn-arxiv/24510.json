The proposed framework involves embedding and reconstructing layers, which is a technique commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and can also be applied to other areas of AI (cs.AI). Finally, the use of ResNet-50, a popular architecture for object recognition tasks, suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of neural engineering (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
