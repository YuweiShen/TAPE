The use of Collective Streaming and the mention of Supercomputing suggest that the paper may also belong to the categories of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) and Systems and Control (cs.SY). The mention of linear algebra and the need for a universal learning machine suggest that the paper may also belong to the categories of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) and Augmented Reality (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
