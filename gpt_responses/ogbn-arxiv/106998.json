It also involves end-to-end learning, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also proposes a new algorithm, which could fall under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the use of the Implicit Function Theorem and residual-conformity trick suggests that the paper could be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves keypoint regression, which could be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
