The proposed cascaded orthogonal space-time block code (COSTBC) is a coding scheme that involves the use of multiple orthogonal space-time block codes, which is a technique commonly used in communication systems (cs.COMM). The paper also discusses the decoding complexity of the COSTBC, which is a topic related to system design and optimization (cs.SY). Finally, the paper provides explicit constructions of COSTBCs for specific network configurations, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM) as it involves the use of multiple antennas."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
