The paper proposes a new task of pose-aware shape reconstruction from a single image and advocates the use of cheaper 2D annotations of object silhouettes in natural images. The paper also proposes new architectures for pose-aware shape reconstruction. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.GR (Graphics), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.RO (Robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
