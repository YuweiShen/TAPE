This falls under the scope of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a wireless access option for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and discusses rate adaptation at different communication distances to enhance the achievable data rate. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, but the proposed approach of using multiple smaller VLC backscatters to generate multi-level signals can potentially be optimized using machine learning techniques. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the implementation of the proposed pixelated VLC backscatter and the integration of multiple smaller VLC backscatters. This falls under the scope of systems and control. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the usage of advanced modulation schemes for the proposed pixelated VLC backscatter, which can potentially be used for multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
