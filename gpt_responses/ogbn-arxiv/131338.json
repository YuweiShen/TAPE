The use of a risk-sensitive cost function and the exploration of fundamental limits suggest that the paper may also be relevant to Statistical Learning (cs.LG) and Signal Processing (cs.SP). The methodology proposed in the paper is applicable to a wide range of parametric families, which could make it relevant to Machine Learning (cs.MM) as well. Finally, the paper's focus on communication problems suggests that it may also be relevant to Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
