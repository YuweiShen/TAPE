The paper discusses the use of generic building blocks and the incorporation of domain expertise. The paper also highlights the interpretability of the framework, which allows a domain expert to validate the predictions made by the framework. The paper uses two use-cases on an electrical machine fleet to demonstrate the applicability of the framework. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.SY, cs.NE, and cs.SE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
