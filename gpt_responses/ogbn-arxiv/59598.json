The paper focuses on the use of rhetorical structure theory and domain knowledge to improve the summarization results. Therefore, it is likely to belong to the categories of natural language processing (cs.CL), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves the use of attentional encoder-decoder models and unsupervised evaluation metrics, which are commonly used in information retrieval (cs.IR) and neural networks (cs.NE) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
