This involves modeling the unknown and time-variant safety values using a spatio-temporal Gaussian process. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper presents a learning algorithm for exploring MDPs with time-variant safety features, which falls under the scope of machine learning.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the application of the proposed algorithm in the field of robotics, specifically in the context of robot navigation.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper's focus on exploring MDPs with safety constraints is a common problem in the field of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper's use of MDPs and safety constraints is relevant to the field of systems and control.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper's use of real lunar terrain data in one of the simulation settings may involve computer vision and pattern recognition techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
