The use of coreset framework to achieve data-independent neural pruning is a novel approach that can be applied to various network architectures. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves optimization techniques, which can be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
