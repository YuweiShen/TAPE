Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves the implementation of the proposed technique in hardware, which suggests the possibility of it belonging to cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) or cs.ET (Embedded Systems). Additionally, the paper discusses the reduction of power overhead, which could indicate the involvement of cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
