The paper also discusses memory requirements and hardware limitations, which are common concerns in machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The use of the Discrete Wavelet Transform and its inverse to coarsen and interpolate the network state suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on signal propagation over physical networks suggests that it may also belong to the social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
