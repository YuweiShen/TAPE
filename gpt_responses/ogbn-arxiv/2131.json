The paper also discusses mixed integer programming and optimization techniques, which are relevant to \"Discrete Mathematics\" (cs.DS) and \"Optimization and Control\" (cs.CC). The use of constrained labels and the characterization of the tightest convex extension of the objective function are related to \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI) and \"Signal and Image Processing\" (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
