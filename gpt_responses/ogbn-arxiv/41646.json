This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR) as well as computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV). The proposed method involves partitioning the fingerprint region and computing ridge-based features, which also relates to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of Cantor pairing function and random projection for cancelable template generation involves machine learning and data mining (cs.LG) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
