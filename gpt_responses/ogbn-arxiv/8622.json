These are all topics that fall under the purview of discrete mathematics.\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper presents a new game played on graphs and analyzes its properties, which is a typical area of research in game theory. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper involves analyzing the behavior of zombies and survivors on graphs, which can be seen as a type of network. The paper also discusses the zombie number of a graph, which is a measure of its vulnerability to attacks, and is relevant to the study of network security.\n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper deals with analyzing the properties of graphs, which can be seen as geometric objects. The paper also discusses the hypercube graph, which is a well-known object in computational geometry.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper involves analyzing the properties of graphs and developing algorithms to compute the zombie number of various graph families. This is a typical area of research in data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
