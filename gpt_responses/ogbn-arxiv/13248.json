The paper also mentions examples and results related to general resolution proofs, which are also topics in proof complexity. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), which includes topics such as combinatorics and graph theory, both of which are relevant to proof complexity. The paper also discusses the size of proofs, which is a topic in computational complexity, making cs.CC (Computational Complexity) another likely sub-category. The paper's focus on regular resolution proofs suggests that it may also belong to cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science), which includes topics such as automated reasoning and proof theory. The paper's mention of examples and results related to artificial intelligence and cryptography suggest that it may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CR (Cryptography), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
