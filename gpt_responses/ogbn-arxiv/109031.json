This topic is closely related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG), as MDPs are commonly used in these fields. The paper also involves decision-making (cs.MA) and control systems (cs.SY), as it deals with strategies for keeping the distribution of states within a given polytope. Finally, the paper involves computational complexity (cs.DS), as it proves the decidability and complexity bounds of the safety problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
