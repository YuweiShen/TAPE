This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a novel uncertainty-aware fusion scheme, which involves analyzing uncertainty measures and scaling modality-specific output softmax probabilities, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also uses a photo-realistic simulation environment (AirSim) to test the proposed method, which falls under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses a probabilistic noisy-or fusion method to integrate the uncertainty-scaled output from each modality, which falls under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
