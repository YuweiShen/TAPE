This falls under the scope of machine learning research.\n3. cs.CV - The paper mentions the use of computer vision techniques to extract information from the game screen, which is used as input for the machine learning models. This falls under the scope of computer vision research.\n4. cs.GT - The paper discusses the use of RTS games as a benchmark for AI research and mentions the use of game theory concepts in the design of the library.
