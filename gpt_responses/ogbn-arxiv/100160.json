The paper also discusses the complexity of the algorithms used for construction, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of numerical and analytical results suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of computational statistics (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper involves the analysis of algorithms, which could fall under the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG), as polar codes have applications in communication systems and error correction, which are important topics in machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
