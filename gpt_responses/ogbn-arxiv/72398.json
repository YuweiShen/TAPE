This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n2. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with entity typing, which is a task in natural language processing. Hence, it can be categorized under cs.CL.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for improving entity typing using hyperbolic embeddings, which is a technique used in artificial intelligence.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with representing hierarchical relations between mentions in context and their target types in a shared vector space, which can be applied to social and information networks.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses two different techniques for creating a large hierarchical entity type inventory, which involves data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
