Additionally, the paper involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques, as well as software engineering (cs.SE) concepts related to endpoint protection. Finally, the use of neural networks for prediction is a key aspect of the paper, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
