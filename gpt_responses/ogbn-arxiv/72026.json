The use of genetic programming to search for the optimal combination of these techniques falls under the sub-category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Finally, the application of these techniques to classification problems with missing data can also be considered under the sub-category of statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
