The approach involves assigning variable sensitivity to each node in the network and training the network using constrained optimization that maximizes the sparsity of the sensitivity variables while ensuring the network's performance. This approach is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
