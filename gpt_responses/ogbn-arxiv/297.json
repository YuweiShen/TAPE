Additionally, the paper proposes a new approach to address the incompatibility between ReLU and element-wise addition, which is a common problem in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the deep network initialization problem, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE). The proposed models are optimized using stochastic gradient descent, which is a common optimization technique in machine learning (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with deep neural networks, which is a topic in deep learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
