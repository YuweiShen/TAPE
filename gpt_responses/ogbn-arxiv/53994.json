Other likely categories could be cs.SI (signal processing), cs.LG (machine learning), cs.CV (computer vision) as the paper involves learning a mapping from audio features to desired audio properties using a massive dataset of simulated room impulse responses. cs.HC (human-computer interaction) could also be a possible category as the paper discusses the limitations of traditional binaural sound localization methods based on time differences of arrival and proposes a new paradigm for sound source localization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
