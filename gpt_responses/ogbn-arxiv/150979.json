The proposed algorithm is also extended to cost-sensitive learning with example dependent costs, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the connection between the proposed algorithm and ROC analysis, which is a topic related to social and information sciences (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
