It involves optimization under probabilistic constraints, which is a common theme in information theory (cs.IT) and networking (cs.NI). The paper also proposes a novel relaxation-restriction approach that involves semidefinite relaxation and convex conic optimization, which are techniques commonly used in control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper presents extensive simulations to evaluate the proposed methods, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
