The paper focuses on computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML) techniques for object detection, which suggests that cs.CV and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also introduces new components to improve the feature pyramid, which could fall under sub-categories such as cs.LG (learning) and cs.NE (neural networks). Finally, the paper's application to object detection suggests that it could also fall under cs.RO (robotics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
