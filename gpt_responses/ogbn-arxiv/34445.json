The paper specifically addresses misunderstandings and myths surrounding Massive MIMO, which suggests a focus on the technical aspects of the technology, making cs.IT and cs.NI the most likely sub-categories. However, the paper also touches on implementation challenges and future research directions, which could fall under cs.SY and cs.MM. The mention of augmented reality in the abstract also suggests a potential connection to cs.AR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
