It also proposes a novel method that uses an auto-encoder architecture to estimate the 3D coordinates of each object pixel without textured models. \n\nIt could also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as the problem of object pose estimation is relevant to robotics applications. \n\nThe paper also proposes a novel loss function, which could be of interest to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. \n\nFinally, the paper deals with the problem of handling symmetric objects, which could be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
