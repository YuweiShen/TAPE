It also provides theoretical proofs and empirical evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language) as it applies the proposed method to text classification. \n\nAdditionally, it could be relevant to cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the nested bags of instances framework can be useful in image classification. \n\nIt may also be relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as it presents experiments on citation graphs and social graph data. \n\nFinally, it could be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it proposes a new approach to supervised learning over graphs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
