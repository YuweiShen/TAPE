The paper proposes a SAT-based system for consistent query answering, which involves logical reasoning and constraint solving (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the complexity of the problem and the use of conjunctive queries, which are topics related to logic and computation (cs.LO). The system proposed in the paper involves the use of weighted MaxSAT, which is a technique used in optimization problems and can be classified under algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
