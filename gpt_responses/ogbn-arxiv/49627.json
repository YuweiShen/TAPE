Additionally, the paper uses the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, which are commonly used in the computer vision community, and the KITTI Road Segmentation dataset, which is used for segmentation tasks in computer vision. Therefore, cs.MM (multimedia) is also a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
