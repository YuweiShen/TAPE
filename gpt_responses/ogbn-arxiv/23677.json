The paper combines state-of-the-art deep learning modules for feature extraction and language modeling, and also performs regularizations on the network's latent representations motivated by insights into cortical encoding of speech production and artifactual aspects specific to ECoG data acquisition. Given these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Other likely sub-categories include cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper heavily relies on deep learning techniques. Additionally, cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.SD (Sound) are also possible sub-categories, as the paper deals with decoding text from brain recordings that are related to speech production and acoustics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
