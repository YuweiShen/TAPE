The paper also uses natural language processing techniques such as clustering of word vectors and semantic similarity metrics, which are common in computational linguistics (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the need for scalability and efficiency in query expansion, which could fall under the category of computer systems and networking (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
