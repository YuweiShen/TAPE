This makes cs.PL the most likely sub-category.\n\n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper also mentions the difficulty of concurrent and distributed programming, which is one of the problems that functional programming languages like Erlang aim to solve.\n\n3. cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper describes the authors' experiences delivering a MOOC on the FutureLearn platform, which involves software engineering practices such as designing and implementing the course, as well as evaluating its effectiveness.\n\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although not a major focus of the paper, the use of functional programming languages like Erlang is sometimes associated with machine learning applications.\n\n5. cs.EDU (Computer Science Education): The paper is an experience report on teaching Erlang through a MOOC, which makes cs.EDU a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
