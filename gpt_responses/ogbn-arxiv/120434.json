It also involves spatial interference alignment and cancellation, which is a technique used in wireless communication networks (cs.NI). The paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI) as it deals with interference cancellation. Additionally, the use of multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver is a common technique in the field of multimedia communication (cs.MM) and the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
