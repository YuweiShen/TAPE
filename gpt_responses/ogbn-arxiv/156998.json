Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes a novel end-to-end neural model, which involves training separate decoders for named entity recognition (NER) and negation detection. This suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture, which is a common technique in natural language processing, indicating that it may also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with information retrieval from clinical datasets, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
