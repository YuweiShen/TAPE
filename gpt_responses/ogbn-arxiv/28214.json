Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves the use of deep learning and neural networks, which falls under the category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves the use of cross-model learning, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves the use of pose-estimation networks, which falls under the category of cs.RO (Robotics). Finally, the paper also involves the study of human behavior and social cues, which falls under the category of cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
