The proposed end-to-end deep architecture based on late fusion is used to model the multi-view metadata for the prediction of mood scores, which involves natural language processing and machine learning techniques (cs.CL). The study also explores the possible connections between bipolar affective disorder and mobile phone usage, which involves human-computer interaction and psychology (cs.HC). The use of mobile phone metadata for mood detection also involves signal processing and data analysis (cs.SI), and the proposed deep architecture involves deep learning techniques (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
