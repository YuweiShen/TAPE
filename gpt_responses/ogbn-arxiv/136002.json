The use of machine learning methods for signal processing suggests a focus on neural engineering (cs.NE) and machine learning (cs.LG). The evaluation of muscular activity also suggests a possible connection to computational biology (cs.CB) and signal processing (cs.SD)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
