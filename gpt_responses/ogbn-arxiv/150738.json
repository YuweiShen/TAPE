The mention of \"standard complexity assumptions\" suggests that it could belong to cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The use of generators and invariant rings suggests that it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry). The mention of \"search problems\" suggests that it could belong to cs.SC (Symbolic Computation) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
