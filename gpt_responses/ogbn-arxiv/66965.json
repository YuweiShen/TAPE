The method involves using a generator and an adversarial loss, which are common techniques in deep learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of a composite loss function, which involves optimizing multiple objectives, indicating a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper involves generating realistic textures, which could fall under the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category.
