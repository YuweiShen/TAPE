The paper proposes a method for learning task objectives from a few example images, which involves meta-learning a classifier. This approach can be used for both model-free reinforcement learning and visual model-based planning, which are relevant to all of the above sub-categories. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.RO, cs.CV, cs.AI, and cs.SY, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
