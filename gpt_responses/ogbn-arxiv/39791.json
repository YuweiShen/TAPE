This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of neural networks for feature mapping suggests a potential application in computer vision (cs.CV) and the focus on conditional independence testing suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the use of the $k$-NN estimator suggests a potential connection to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
