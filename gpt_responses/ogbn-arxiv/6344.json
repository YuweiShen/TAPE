This problem is related to information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP), which are covered by the cs.IR and cs.CL sub-categories. The paper also proposes a method inspired by dependency grammars, which is a technique commonly used in NLP. Therefore, cs.DL (digital libraries), cs.LG (machine learning), and cs.CY (computational linguistics) are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
