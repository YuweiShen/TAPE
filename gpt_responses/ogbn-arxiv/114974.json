The method involves fitting a surrogate function using radial basis functions, which is a common technique in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The algorithm also involves iteratively proposing new samples for comparison, which is a common technique in optimization and decision-making (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of probability functions, which is a common technique in statistics and machine learning (cs.SI). Finally, the paper provides implementations of the algorithm in MATLAB and Python, which suggests a focus on computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
