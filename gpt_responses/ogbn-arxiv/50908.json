This involves learning policies that are parametrized by a goal, which suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO). The use of physics simulation and block stacking tasks also suggests a potential connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the goal-oriented nature of the learning framework may also relate to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
