The approach involves the use of mirror descent algorithm for maximum a posterior inference and back propagation over a deep architecture together with stochastic gradient/mirror descent for model parameter estimation. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
