This falls under the field of robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). The approach also involves the use of quadratic programming, which is a common optimization technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of simulation experiments, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) or computer vision (cs.CV) if visual sensors are used in the simulation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
