Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also mentions the use of WordNet, a lexical database, to encode prior world-knowledge, which suggests a possible connection to natural language processing and thus cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes a deterministic algorithm for computing class centroids, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential use of these embeddings for novelty detection and few-shot learning, which could relate to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
