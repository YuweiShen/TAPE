The paper also discusses the rank-deficiency problem of the upper triangular matrix R encountered during sphere decoding, which is related to signal processing (cs.SI) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the complexity of the STBCs, which can be analyzed using computational complexity theory (cs.CC) and multimedia (cs.MM) due to the use of complex symbols."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
