The method involves feature extraction, global and local information acquisition, and non-maximum suppression (NMS) to produce final detection results. Given that the paper focuses on computer vision and machine learning techniques, it is most likely to belong to the cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) sub-category. However, since the proposed method involves robotics and automation, it could also belong to the cs.RO (Robotics) sub-category. Additionally, since the paper involves training a CNN, it could belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category. The paper also involves the integration of global and local information, which could place it in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category. Finally, since the paper involves processing images, it could also belong to the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
