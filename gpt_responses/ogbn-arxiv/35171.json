The use of extreme learning machines (ELMs) and the proposed algorithms for decentralized learning also suggest a focus on neural networks and distributed computing, which are relevant to the sub-categories of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), social and information networks (cs.SI), and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Overall, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE, cs.SI, and cs.DC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
