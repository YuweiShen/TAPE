This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of Fisher vector encoding for deep feature encoding, which is a technique commonly used in multimedia analysis (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper involves statistical analysis and cross-validation techniques, which are relevant to the field of machine learning and statistics (cs.MS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
