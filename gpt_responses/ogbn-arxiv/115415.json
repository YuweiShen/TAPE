The use of rectified linear units (ReLU) is mentioned, which is a common technique in deep learning, indicating that the paper is likely to be in the sub-category of neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses empirical and theoretical evidence, suggesting that it may be in the sub-category of machine learning theory (cs.LG). The experimental study involves image classification, which is a common application of computer vision (cs.CV). The paper proposes a new non-linear activation function, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the use of the Kumaraswamy distribution suggests that the paper may be in the sub-category of statistical learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
