This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The proposed framework is decentralized and involves distributed caching, which falls under the domain of distributed computing. \n3. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper discusses the use of blockchain-based smart contracts to enforce trust and financial incentives for cache helpers. This involves cryptography and security aspects. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a game-theoretic perspective to model the interaction between cache helpers and content providers, which involves designing algorithms for equilibrium searching. This falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms. \n5. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) - The paper extensively uses game theory to model the interaction between cache helpers and content providers, and proposes a decentralized strategy-searching algorithm using sequential best response.
