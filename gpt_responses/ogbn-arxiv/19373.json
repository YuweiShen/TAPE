The paper proposes a new approach based on optimization modulo theory, which extends satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) to maximization problems. This approach takes into account the semantics of the program, in contrast to other methods that compute the longest path whether or not it is feasible according to these semantics. The paper also discusses the encoding of the WCET problem into SMT, which is a key aspect of the approach. Given these topics, the most likely sub-categories are cs.PL (Programming Languages), cs.EM (Embedded Systems), cs.AR (Architecture), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
