This falls under the category of natural language processing (NLP), which is a subfield of computer science that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also utilizes metadata and hidden patterns within the text of tweets, which involves data mining and machine learning techniques. This could fall under the sub-categories of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.CY (Computers and Society). \n\nAdditionally, the paper addresses the issue of online abuse, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). \n\nFinally, the paper proposes a deep learning architecture, which involves designing and training neural networks. This could fall under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
