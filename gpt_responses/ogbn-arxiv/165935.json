The use of residual modules and skip-connections is a common technique in deep learning (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The incorporation of depth information also involves robotics (cs.RO) and neural networks (cs.NE) research. Therefore, these sub-categories are likely to be relevant to this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
