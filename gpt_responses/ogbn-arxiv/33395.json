This involves learning hierarchical features representations using CNN and using ELM as a parallel supervised classifier. The paper also proposes an Adaptive OS-ELM (AOS-ELM) for concept drift adaptability in classifier level and matrices concatenation ensembles for concept drift adaptability in ensemble level. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
