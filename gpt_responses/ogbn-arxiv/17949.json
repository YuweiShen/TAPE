This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, which are commonly associated with the Graphics (cs.GR) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the visualization of complex types of data, which is relevant to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the scalability issues of existing immersive environments, which could be relevant to the Cybersecurity (cs.CY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
