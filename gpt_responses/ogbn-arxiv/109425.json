It also involves the use of channel coefficients and signal-to-noise ratios, which are concepts in networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses extensions for multiple transmitters and receivers, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of finite field interference channels, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM) and communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
