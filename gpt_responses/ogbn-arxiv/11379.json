This topic is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) as DCNs are commonly used in these fields. Additionally, the paper discusses the optimization problem formulation and solution, which could fall under the category of robotics (cs.AR) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
