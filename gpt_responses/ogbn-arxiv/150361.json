The paper also discusses optimization and training techniques, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a new network architecture for object detection, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of BatchNorm in the proposed method also suggests a potential connection to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its method on benchmark datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
