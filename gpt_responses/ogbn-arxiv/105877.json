The examples provided are related to equalization, which falls under signal processing (cs.SI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of soft-bit messages, which are commonly used in network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the mention of Gaussian messages suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM) applications such as image and video processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
