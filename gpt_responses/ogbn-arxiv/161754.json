The use of chance-constrained programming and sample approximation techniques also suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the simulations mentioned in the paper may involve multimedia applications (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
