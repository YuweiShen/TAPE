The paper also employs number-theoretic methods, which suggests that it could also be categorized under cryptography and security (cs.CR) or discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Additionally, the paper discusses the construction of linear codes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper uses algebraic and combinatorial techniques, which are also relevant to number theory (cs.NT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
