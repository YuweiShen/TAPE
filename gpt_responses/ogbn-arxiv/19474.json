Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses machine learning techniques such as LIME, LRP, and DeepLIFT, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of hybrid documents, which can be related to the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision) that deals with multi-modal data. Finally, the paper's evaluation paradigms do not require manual annotation, which can be related to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) that focuses on unsupervised learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
