This work is highly relevant to the fields of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI), as well as robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY) where optimization is a key component. Additionally, the use of regularity assumptions and statistical consistency suggests a connection to data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
