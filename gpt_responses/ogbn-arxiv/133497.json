Additionally, the paper discusses the use of log-pseudolikelihood scores (LPLs) to improve these tasks, which is a common technique in the field of computational linguistics. \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of large, autoregressive language models like GPT-2, which falls under the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nFurthermore, the paper discusses the use of RoBERTa to reduce WER (Word Error Rate) and improve BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the use of BERT to estimate sentence LPLs without masking, which falls under the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision) as it involves image captioning and natural language generation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
