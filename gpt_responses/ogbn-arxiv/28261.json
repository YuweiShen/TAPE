It also introduces a new concept called V-values, which are elements of a vector space that is sufficiently expressive to cover all cases of interest. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), followed by cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
