The paper proposes an algorithm that enables the learning of safety constraints in parallel with reinforcement learning. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
