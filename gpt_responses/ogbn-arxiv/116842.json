The paper also introduces new notions that combine quantum information and quantum complexity, which could potentially be relevant to the fields of computational complexity (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper specifically mentions the study of quantum analogues of classical theorems, which suggests a focus on quantum information theory (cs.QI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
