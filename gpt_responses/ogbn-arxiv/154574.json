This problem has applications in computational biology and computer graphics. The paper uses techniques from computational geometry, discrete mathematics, and algorithms, and presents complexity results and algorithms for various versions of the problem. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CG (Computational Geometry). Other likely sub-categories include cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
