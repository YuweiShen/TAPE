The paper presents a two-fold approach to deal with concept drift in high dimensional, noisy, low-context data such as streaming text, video, or images. The approach involves density-based clustering and weak-supervision steps. The paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the theory, algorithms, and applications of machine learning. The paper's focus on concept drift detection and adaptation in learning and classification makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category deals with the theory, algorithms, and applications of computer vision and pattern recognition. The paper's mention of streaming video and images as examples of high dimensional, noisy, low-context data makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category deals with the theory, algorithms, and applications of information retrieval. The paper's mention of search data as an example of concept drift makes it a likely candidate for this sub-category. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with the theory, algorithms, and applications of natural language processing and computational linguistics. The paper's mention of streaming text as an example"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
