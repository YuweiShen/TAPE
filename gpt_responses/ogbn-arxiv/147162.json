The paper also formalizes this problem as a multiarmed bandit problem, which is a well-studied problem in the field of reinforcement learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also uses information theoretic tools to derive regret bounds, which suggests that it could belong to cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper uses operator spectra to obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
