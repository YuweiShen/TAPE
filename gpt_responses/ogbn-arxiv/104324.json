The paper specifically focuses on incorporating an epistemic dimension to an existing formal model of causality, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also uses logical reasoning to define and analyze the concept of epistemic causality, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-field of logic in computer science (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper deals with multi-agent contexts, which suggests that it may be relevant to the sub-field of multi-agent systems (cs.MA). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the sub-fields of computer communication (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR), as reasoning about causality and knowledge is important in these areas as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
