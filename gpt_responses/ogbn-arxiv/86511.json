Computer vision techniques are used to process the radiology scans and eye-tracking data. \n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the design of an eye-tracking interface that provides radiologists with a real radiology reading room experience. The study also examines the behaviors of radiologists while screening medical images to better understand how they interact with the information in an image. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel algorithm that unifies eye-tracking data and a CAD system. The proposed C-CAD uses a deep learning algorithm to segment and diagnose cancers simultaneously. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the analysis of medical images and the use of eye-tracking data to improve diagnostic decisions. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a deep learning algorithm in a newly designed multi-task learning platform to segment and diagnose cancers simultaneously."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
