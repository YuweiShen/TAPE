The proposed framework involves a combination of human experts, machine learning algorithms, and crowdsourcing, which falls under the category of social computing (cs.SI). The paper also introduces a novel optimization problem and algorithm for constrained clustering and outlier detection, which are fundamental topics in data science (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
