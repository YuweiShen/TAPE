The approach proposed involves learning a semantic embedding and regularizers, which are techniques commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also validates the approach on challenging datasets, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
