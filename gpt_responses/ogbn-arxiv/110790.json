Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves approximation techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning and optimization, making cs.LG a likely sub-category as well. The paper also discusses search strategies, which are relevant to robotics and control, making cs.RO another likely sub-category. The paper also involves state representation, which is a fundamental concept in data structures and algorithms, making cs.DS a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves algorithm development and implementation, which is relevant to software engineering, making cs.SE a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
