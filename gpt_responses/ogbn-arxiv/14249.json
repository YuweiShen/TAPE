It is also likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it proposes a novel deep self-learning framework to train a robust network without extra supervision. Additionally, it may belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it deals with learning from noisy data, which is a common problem in AI. It may also belong to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category as it proposes a self-learning framework that could potentially be applied to natural language processing tasks. Finally, it may belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as it deals with image datasets such as Clothing1M and Food101-N."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
