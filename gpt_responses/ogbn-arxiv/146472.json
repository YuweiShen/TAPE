This falls under the domain of computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep convolutional neural networks for encoding drawing styles suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the field of machine learning (cs.LG). The application of the proposed method to cultural heritage preservation and the involvement of experts in the evaluation of the results suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the fields of human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
