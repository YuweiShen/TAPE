These concepts are often used in the design and analysis of algorithms for optimization and machine learning, making cs.DS a likely category for this paper.\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory): The Cram\\'er-Rao bound is a fundamental result in information theory, which provides a lower bound on the variance of unbiased estimators of a parameter. The present paper extends this bound to the case of Lie groups, which could be of interest to researchers in cs.IT.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Lie groups and Riemannian metrics are commonly used in machine learning for tasks such as manifold learning and optimization. The intrinsic Cram\\'er-Rao bound derived in this paper could have applications in these areas, making cs.LG a likely category.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the estimation of a parameter, which is a fundamental problem in systems and control theory. The use of Lie groups and Riemannian metrics in this context could be of interest to researchers in cs.SY.\n5. cs.ME (Mechanical Engineering): Lie groups and Riemannian metrics are also used in mechanical engineering for"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
