The use of regularization is also a key aspect of the paper. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision), which are also related to machine learning. The use of regularization and optimization techniques also suggests the sub-categories cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
