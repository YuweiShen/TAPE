This involves the use of neural networks to approximate the solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern fluid flow in the reservoir. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers research on the development and application of machine learning and other AI techniques, which are central to the proxy model described in the paper.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category focuses on the development and analysis of algorithms that enable machines to learn from data, which is a key aspect of the proxy model.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category covers research on the development and application of neural networks and other biologically-inspired computing techniques, which are used in the proxy model to approximate the PDE solutions.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): This sub-category covers research on the use of computational methods to solve problems in engineering, finance, and science, which is the main focus of the paper.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): This sub-category covers research on the development and maintenance of software systems, which may be relevant to the implementation of the proxy model in practice."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
