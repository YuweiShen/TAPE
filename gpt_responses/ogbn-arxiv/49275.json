The use of the holonomic gradient method for computing the probability density function of the signal-to-noise ratio also suggests a numerical analysis (cs.NA) aspect to the paper. The paper also discusses the use of zero-forcing detection in heterogeneous networks, which could fall under the systems and control (cs.SY) category. The use of MIMO spatial-multiplexing transmission and zero-forcing detection also suggests a potential application in multimedia (cs.MM) and communication engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
