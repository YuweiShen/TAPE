The paper also discusses the use of a hierarchical classifier scheme, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The use of temporal information in the classification process suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper's focus on achieving high classification accuracy through the use of advanced techniques such as fine-tuning and late fusion suggests that it may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
