The proposed method uses a graph-based distillation framework to transfer knowledge from multiple self-supervised tasks, which involves machine learning (ML) techniques such as distillation and ensembling, falling under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the challenge of heterogeneity among different features, which is a common issue in multimedia (MM) research. Additionally, the proposed method involves solving a multi-distribution joint matching problem, which is a common problem in artificial intelligence (AI) research. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on three video datasets, which involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as text classification, falling under the sub-category of computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
