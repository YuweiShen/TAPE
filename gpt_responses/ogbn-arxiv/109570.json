This involves the use of cross-sectional OCT depth profile scans, which are captured using THORLabs Telesto series spectral-domain fingerprint reader. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), which deals with image and video processing, analysis, and understanding. \n\nThe paper also focuses on the resilience of OCT fingerprints to presentation attacks, which involves the use of fake layers (presentation attacks) placed over finger skin. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category, which deals with the design and analysis of cryptographic algorithms and protocols, as well as security and privacy issues in computer systems and networks. \n\nFurthermore, the paper involves the use of deep learning techniques, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category, which deals with multimedia content analysis, retrieval, and understanding, as well as multimedia systems and applications. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of visualization techniques to identify the regions in the OCT scan patches that are crucial for fingerprint PAD detection. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category, which deals with the design and evaluation of information"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
