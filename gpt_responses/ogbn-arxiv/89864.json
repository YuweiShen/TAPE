The paper also discusses the theoretical basis for why ranked demonstrations can lead to better-than-demonstrator performance. \n\nThe paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics) as imitation learning is a common technique used in these fields. \n\nAdditionally, the paper includes experiments on standard Atari and MuJoCo benchmarks, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
