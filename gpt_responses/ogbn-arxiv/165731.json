The use of deep convolutional neural networks suggests that machine learning (cs.MM) is also relevant. The paper also discusses the collection of training data, which could fall under the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with the statistical relationships between appearance features, which could fall under the sub-category of graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the use of deep learning for image harmonization could also fall under the sub-category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
