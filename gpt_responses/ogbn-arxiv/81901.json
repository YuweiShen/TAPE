The use of polar codes and the analysis of achievable rates are also typical topics in information theory. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper focuses on the strong secrecy condition, which is a fundamental concept in cryptography and security. The use of secret-keys and the consideration of an eavesdropper also suggest that this paper belongs to this category. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): Although the paper does not explicitly mention social or information networks, the Wiretap Broadcast Channel can be seen as a network communication problem. The design of a coding scheme that allows multiple messages to be sent to different receivers can also be relevant to network applications. \n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper does not seem to involve any computational complexity analysis or algorithmic design, but the use of polar codes may have some connections to computational complexity. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper does not involve any multimedia content or applications, but the use of multiple messages and the consideration of different types of information may be relevant to multimedia communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
