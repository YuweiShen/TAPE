This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a numerical evaluation framework for validating these systems, which involves developing metrics to quantify the plausibility of hypotheses.
