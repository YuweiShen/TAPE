The paper also discusses the use of image-level scoring and temporal selection rules, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the application of the proposed method to videos, which falls under robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM).
