The paper proposes algorithms for both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes, which are related to communication and information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The paper also considers energy budgets of both the UAV and IoT devices, which is related to control and systems engineering (cs.SY). The proposed algorithms use optimization techniques such as alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA), which are related to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with data collection from IoT devices, which may involve multimedia data such as images and videos (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
