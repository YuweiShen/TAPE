It also involves distance metric learning and view-manifold modification, which are common topics in computer vision research. \n\nThe paper also involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it discusses the re-training process of the DCNN and the transfer of learning to novel objects. \n\nNeural networks (cs.NE) is another likely sub-category as the paper deals with the modification of feature representation in deep networks and the development of perceptual similarity judgment in biological neural networks. \n\nArtificial intelligence (cs.AI) is also a possible sub-category as the paper involves the development of a model for similarity perception of objects. \n\nFinally, natural language processing (cs.CL) is a less likely sub-category as the paper does not involve any language processing, but it does discuss the matching of human perceptual similarity judgment, which could be relevant to natural language understanding."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
