This involves using a joint attention mechanism and biased generation probability to leverage topic information in generation. The paper is likely to belong to the arXiv CS sub-categories of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) as it deals with natural language processing and response generation, Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) as it proposes a model for chatbots, Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it uses a sequence-to-sequence framework, Information Retrieval (cs.IR) as it involves topic modeling, and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) as it uses a neural network model."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
