The paper also discusses pre-training using unsupervised schemes, regularization, and learning procedures, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of dropout, which is a regularization technique commonly used in neural networks and falls under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category.
