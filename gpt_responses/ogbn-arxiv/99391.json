The paper also mentions Soft Linear Logic, which is a type of substructural logic, and this could potentially place the paper in the subcategory of programming languages (cs.PL) or theoretical computer science (cs.LT). Additionally, the paper discusses termination properties of processes, which could place it in the subcategory of formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL) or distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
