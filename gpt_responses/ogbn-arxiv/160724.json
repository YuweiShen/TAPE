It may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as it proposes a method to reduce the computation cost and model size of deep neural networks while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, it may belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) sub-categories as it involves techniques for reducing computation and optimizing the use of resources in embedded systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
