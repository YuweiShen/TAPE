The use of graph-based representation and topic signatures suggests a focus on NLP and text analysis, which would fit under cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Additionally, the use of machine learning techniques for similarity detection could also fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the preprocessing steps and data structures used in the proposed method could also be relevant to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
