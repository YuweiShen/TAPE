This topic is closely related to databases and data management. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses SpLog, a concatenation logic, to investigate core spanners. This is a logical approach to the problem and falls under the scope of cs.LO. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper deals with the complexity of maintaining document spanners in a dynamic setting, which is a classic problem in data structures and algorithms. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper analyzes the dynamic complexity of document spanners, which is a complexity-related problem. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper uses formal language theory to prove that regular spanners can be maintained in the dynamic complexity class DynPROP. This falls under the scope of cs.FL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
