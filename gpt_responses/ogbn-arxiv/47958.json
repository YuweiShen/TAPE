The paper also introduces a heuristic for path determination, which involves optimization and algorithm design (cs.IT). The paper conducts extensive computational experiments, which involves data analysis and statistical modeling (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the impact of the heuristic on network-wide throughput, which involves performance evaluation and optimization (cs.LG).
