This involves utilizing the sparsity of the RF data in the Fourier domain. Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV) as it deals with image processing and reconstruction. The paper also involves the use of deep learning algorithms, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves signal processing techniques, which could fall under information theory (cs.IT) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a novel approach to reduce data rate, which could fall under neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
