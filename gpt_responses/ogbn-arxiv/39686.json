The proposed approach involves multi-task learning, which is a common technique in machine learning (ML) research. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves the use of a deep neural network, which is a popular tool in ML research, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of carefully designed losses, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (AI) research, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of image databases, which is a common topic in multimedia (MM) research, making cs.MM (Multimedia) another likely sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with face identification, which is a common topic in graphics (GR) research, making cs.GR (Computer Graphics) another likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
