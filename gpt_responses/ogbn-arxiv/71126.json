The proposed approach involves the fusion of features generated by different deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of templates, which is a common approach in multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the evaluation of the proposed approach in terms of recognition performance, which is a common topic in cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
