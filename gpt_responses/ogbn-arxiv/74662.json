The paper also discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn a compact embedding on large-scale face data, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper introduces a semantic bootstrapping method to improve the consistency of predictions with noisy labels, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
