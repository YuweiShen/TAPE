The paper proposes a new metric, the nonlinearity coefficient (NLC), which measures the complexity of the function computed by a neural network based on the magnitude of the gradient. This metric is shown to be a powerful predictor of test error and overfitting in deep networks. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
