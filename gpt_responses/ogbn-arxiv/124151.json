This technique is applicable to a wide range of machine learning scenarios and does not require deep domain expertise or hyper-parameter tuning. Therefore, it could fit into several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
