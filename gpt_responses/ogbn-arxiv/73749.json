The paper uses tools from stochastic geometry to provide the first analytical backing for an NLOS bias error model. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Machine Learning (cs.MA), and Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
