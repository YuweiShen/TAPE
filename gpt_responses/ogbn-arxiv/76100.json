The paper specifically focuses on using rarity of events as a reward signal to encourage exploration and adaptiveness in the agent's policy, which is a technique that could be applied to a wide range of RL tasks and environments. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG and cs.AI, followed by cs.RO, cs.CV, and cs.GT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
