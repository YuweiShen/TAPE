This falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper discusses the extension of the ratio to the adaptive greedy algorithm, which allows applications to non-submodular stochastic maximization problems. This is a machine learning problem. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper proposes a new technique for maximizing non-submodular functions, which is a problem in artificial intelligence. \n4. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the use of the curvature of the objective function to estimate the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm. This is related to information theory. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper's technique can be applied to problems modeling incomplete data with uncertainty, which is a problem in social and information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
