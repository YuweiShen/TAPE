The paper proposes a novel method for selecting discriminative subgraph features in uncertain graphs, which involves computing the probability distribution of the discrimination scores for each subgraph feature based on dynamic programming and then using a branch-and-bound algorithm to search for discriminative subgraphs efficiently. This problem is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), social and information networks (cs.SI), data mining (cs.DM), and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
