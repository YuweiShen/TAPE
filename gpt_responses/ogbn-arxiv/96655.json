The paper also discusses the application of the capacity-achieving scheme to the complex-valued Gaussian C-IFC, which involves signal processing and network information theory (cs.NI, cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions a constant gap result, which could be related to machine learning and optimization (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
