The paper specifically focuses on the $\\ell_\\infty$ attacks, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of neural networks, which is a popular topic in the sub-field of neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the concept of Rademacher complexity, which is a common topic in the sub-field of computational complexity (cs.CR). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.CR, and cs.NE, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
