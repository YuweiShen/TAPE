The use of vectors and real numbers suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. The mention of synchronous and asynchronous systems, as well as the use of norms as distance metrics, suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-categories.
