The method uses a trained deep neural network, which falls under the category of machine learning and deep learning (LG). The paper also discusses the optical properties of the scattering media, which relates to information theory (IT) and optics (OH). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.IT, and cs.OH."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
