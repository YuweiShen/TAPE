The use of a decentralized leader-follower control architecture suggests a focus on multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and the need for efficient traffic management implies a systems and control perspective (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of simulations, which suggests a potential focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques for optimizing the traffic management strategies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
