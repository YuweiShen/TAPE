This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also proposes a deep learning framework using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for data fusion, which is a technique used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The framework is also applied to object detection, which falls under robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
