This work involves computer vision (CV) techniques such as image classification and 3D modeling, as well as graphics (GR) techniques for creating virtual characters. It also involves artificial intelligence (AI) methods for training the classifiers and optimizing the facial details. The use of deep learning suggests that this work may fall under the machine learning (LG) sub-category as well. Finally, the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (MM) applications such as computer games and animations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
