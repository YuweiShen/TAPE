The paper discusses the use of an external corpus and distributed search architecture, which are common topics in information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also mentions resource selection algorithms, which could fall under the category of computational intelligence (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of deep learning (cs.DL) for microblog retrieval in related work. Finally, the paper discusses the dynamic nature of microblogs, which could relate to the topic of cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
