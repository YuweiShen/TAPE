The paper discusses the notion of quantitative modality and its use in lifting a property on values to a property on computations. The paper also discusses the equivalence of terms and the applicative bisimilarity. These topics are closely related to the areas of logic (cs.LO), programming languages (cs.PL), software engineering (cs.SE), formal methods (cs.FL), and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
