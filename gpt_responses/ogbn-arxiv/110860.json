The paper presents a novel algorithm for weighted sampling without replacement from a distributed stream, which has applications in identifying residual heavy hitters. This suggests that the paper is likely to be classified under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also uses information theory and algorithms (cs.IT and cs.AL) to derive upper and lower bounds on message complexity, and discusses the practical implications of the algorithm for distributed systems (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
