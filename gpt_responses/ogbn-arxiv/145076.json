The paper also involves information theory (cs.IT) in its analysis of the limitations of random oracles. The paper's focus on black-box separations and computational hardness suggests that it may also be relevant to complexity theory (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper's discussion of secure function evaluation (SFE) suggests that it may be relevant to computer engineering (cs.CE) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
