Therefore, cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the need for interoperability between multiple transfer protocols, which falls under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of cloud computing, which aligns with cs.Distributed Systems. The paper also discusses the need for accurate estimation of delivery time, which is related to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
