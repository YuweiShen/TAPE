Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also discusses specific decoding metrics, which falls under the sub-category cs.COMM (Communication and Networking). The concept of achievable code rates is introduced, which is related to the sub-category cs.SI (Signal Processing). The paper also uses Gallager's error exponent approach, which is related to the sub-category cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper discusses a practical instance of probabilistic shaping, which is related to the sub-category cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
