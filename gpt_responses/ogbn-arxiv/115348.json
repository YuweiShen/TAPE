The study of trapping sets, which are sets of variable nodes that cannot be corrected by the decoding algorithm, is also a topic in network information theory. The investigation of the expansion of variable nodes is related to network science (cs.NI) and the study of graph properties. Finally, the use of bit flipping algorithms is related to distributed systems (cs.DS) and their implementation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
