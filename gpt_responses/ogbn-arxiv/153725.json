The paper also discusses the impact of hardware impairments on system performance, which is a concern in the field of networked systems (cs.SY) and network infrastructure (cs.NI). Finally, the paper mentions the degrees of freedom of MIMO systems, which is a concept related to multiple access (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
