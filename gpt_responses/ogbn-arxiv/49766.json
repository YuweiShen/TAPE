The paper also applies the framework to navigation tasks, which are often studied in robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper mentions using the framework with entropy-regularized RL, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
