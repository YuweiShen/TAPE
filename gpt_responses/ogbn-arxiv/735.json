The paper focuses on optimizing the biConvex 1-bit PrecOding (C2PO) algorithm using neural networks. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the study of communication systems and their limits. The paper also uses deep learning tools, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) a likely category. The use of neural networks for optimization also makes cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible category. The paper deals with optimization of a communication system, which makes cs.SY (Systems and Control) a possible category. Finally, the paper deals with wireless communication systems, which makes cs.MM (Multimedia) a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
