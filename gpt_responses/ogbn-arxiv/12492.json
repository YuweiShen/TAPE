The paper discusses the use of pre-trained models from large datasets such as ImageNet and Kinetics to improve the performance of 3D medical image analysis tasks. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Multimedia (cs.MM) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) are also possible sub-categories as they are related to image analysis and deep learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
