This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of heterogeneous public web databases, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a new framework for webly-supervised learning, which involves training two independent CNNs, indicating a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
