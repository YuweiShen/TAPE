The proposed network uses atrous spatial pyramid pooling and random transformations, which are techniques commonly used in deep learning (cs.LG, cs.DL). The paper also discusses the importance of uncertainty in diagnostic decision making, which is a topic related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
