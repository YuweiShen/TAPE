The approach proposed in the paper is based on distributed training of linear classifiers, which is a specific problem in machine learning. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also deals with communication costs in distributed environments, which is a common problem in distributed computing. Therefore, cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) is also a likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to the formation of approximate objective functions, which involves optimization techniques. Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also likely sub-categories. \n\nFinally, the paper evaluates its approach against other recent distributed methods, which involves experimental evaluation. Therefore, cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
