The paper also uses techniques from computational complexity theory (cs.CC) to establish hardness results. The focus on succinct games suggests a connection to data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms (cs.AI). Finally, the paper proposes an algorithmic framework for computing approximate correlated equilibria, which falls under the umbrella of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
