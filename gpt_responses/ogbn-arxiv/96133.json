The use of light-field images and graph-cut optimization suggests that the paper belongs to the computer vision (cs.CV) and graphics (cs.GR) subcategories. The use of a dataset and the evaluation of the proposed method suggest that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) subcategory. The use of an occlusion detector suggests that the paper may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) subcategory. Finally, the use of likelihood estimation suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) subcategory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
