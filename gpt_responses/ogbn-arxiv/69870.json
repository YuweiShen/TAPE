The paper also presents algorithms for solving the problem in polynomial time for certain classes of games, which involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and combinatorial optimization (cs.DS). The paper also considers well-studied and well-motivated coalitional games defined compactly on combinatorial domains, which suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper discusses the complexity of computing optimal coalition structures, which is a topic in computational complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
