This involves learning the optimal ROI locations and optimizing the model parameters. The paper uses computer vision techniques to analyze the CEUS video clips and classify different types of FLLs based on their spatial and temporal enhancement patterns. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
