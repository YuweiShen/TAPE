This involves mining correlations among multiple tasks and leveraging shared knowledge from related tasks to improve feature selection performance. The paper also discusses the use of manifold learning to analyze feature spaces using both labeled and unlabeled data. These topics are closely related to machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), multimedia (cs.MM), information retrieval (cs.IR), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
