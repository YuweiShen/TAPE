The paper also mentions applications in automated science and adversarial reverse engineering, which are relevant to computer vision and cybersecurity, respectively. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision). The paper also proposes a general framework that reduces the dimensionality of the problem, which is related to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions the resilience of the proposed method to noise, which is relevant to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
