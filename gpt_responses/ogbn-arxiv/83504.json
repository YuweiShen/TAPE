The connection between inverse determinant sums and diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff also suggests a strong link to information theory. \n2. cs.AL (Algorithms): The paper discusses the design and analysis of algebraic space-time block codes, which involves developing algorithms for encoding and decoding. \n3. cs.GR (Group Theory): The paper uses Lie groups to study the growth of inverse determinant sums, which suggests a connection to group theory. \n4. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper involves studying asymptotic integrals in Lie groups, which may require numerical methods for evaluation. \n5. cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): While not directly related to logic, the paper involves a rigorous mathematical analysis of algebraic space-time block codes, which may involve logical reasoning and proof techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
