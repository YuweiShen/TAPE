Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves coding theory and information theory, which suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Additionally, the paper proposes a new construction for non-malleable codes, which involves coset-coding, indicating a possible connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper discusses the efficiency of the proposed scheme, which could be relevant to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
