It also uses neural network models for learning bilingual phrase embeddings. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) as it uses recursive autoencoders and bidimensional attention networks for learning phrase representations. \n\ncs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another likely sub-category as the paper proposes a novel model for integrating clues and source-target interactions into bilingual phrase representations. \n\ncs.IR (Information Retrieval) is also a possible sub-category as the paper uses a bilinear neural model to measure bilingual semantic similarity, which is a common task in information retrieval. \n\nFinally, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a possible sub-category as the paper uses neural network models for learning bilingual phrase embeddings and for measuring bilingual semantic similarity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
