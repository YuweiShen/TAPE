The paper also introduces a novel loss function and network architecture, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of deep fully convolutional networks also suggests the possibility of neural network optimization (cs.NE). Finally, the paper applies the proposed method to face detection, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
