The paper emphasizes the extensibility, flexibility, performance, and scalability of the new software framework. The interdisciplinary approach and the combination of expertise from different disciplines suggest that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories. However, based on the content of the paper, the most likely sub-categories are cs.MS (Mathematical Software), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
