The most relevant sub-category is likely cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper focuses on improving the performance of machine learning models. Additionally, the use of meta-features could also place it in the sub-categories of cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as these fields often use additional inputs to improve model performance. The paper also discusses the use of linear regression, which could place it in the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as well as cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), as these fields often use linear models for prediction and analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
