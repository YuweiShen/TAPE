The use of a non-linear colorspace and the proposed \"reuse plus patch\" method also suggest a focus on machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the mention of \"symmetric non-linear colorspace\" may suggest a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
