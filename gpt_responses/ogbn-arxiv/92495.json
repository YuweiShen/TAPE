The proposed solution involves developing a meta-learning algorithm to improve the network's representation of previous tasks while learning new ones. This topic is closely related to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), and natural language processing (cs.CL). However, given the focus on neural networks and sequential learning, cs.LG and cs.NE are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.AI, cs.CV, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
