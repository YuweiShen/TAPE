The paper focuses on the use of POS tags and morphological information to improve the performance of NER for morphologically rich languages like Bulgarian. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. Other likely sub-categories include cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.IR (Information Retrieval), as the paper uses deep learning techniques and models to improve NER performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
