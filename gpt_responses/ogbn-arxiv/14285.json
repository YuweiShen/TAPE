Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is Robotics (cs.RO). The paper also mentions the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for autonomy and agility, computer vision (cs.CV) for localization of artifacts, and distributed database mesh networking system (cs.SY) for reporting data. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of machine learning (cs.MA) for decision-making and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
