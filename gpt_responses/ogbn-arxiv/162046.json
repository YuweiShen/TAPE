This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of Squeeze-and-Excitation operations for feature recalibration suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The evaluation of the proposed model on two challenging benchmarks, HMDB51 and UCF101, indicates the involvement of multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network suggests the involvement of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
