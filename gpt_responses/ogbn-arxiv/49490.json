This is a problem commonly encountered in computer vision, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed method involves the use of active rotating filters (ARFs) and oriented response networks (ORNs), which are related to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also reports results on several commonly used benchmarks, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
