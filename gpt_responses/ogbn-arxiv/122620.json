The use of channel state information (CSI) and the construction of an overlay erasure channel suggest a system-level approach, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of numerical simulations, which could fall under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) or multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
