The paper also discusses the use of Gaussian Process for sensing complex obstacles, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The optimization algorithm proposed in the paper is based on second-order cone programming, which is a common technique in control theory (cs.SY). Finally, the paper also mentions the use of Wolfe's algorithm, which is a well-known optimization method in computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
