The paper also discusses the complexity of sampling from DPPs with additional constraints, which is a problem related to computational complexity and algorithms, making cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) another likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of polynomials in solving the constrained sampling problem, which is a topic covered in cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity). Finally, the paper discusses the application of DPPs in ensuring fairness constraints, which is a topic covered in cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
