The paper also discusses the estimation of variance, which is related to statistics and data analysis (cs.DS). The application of the method to improve advertisement design suggests a connection to computer engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the mention of convergence rates and uncertainty quantification suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
