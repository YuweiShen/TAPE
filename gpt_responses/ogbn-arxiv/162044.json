The vulnerability of codes in a wiretap channel setting is also mentioned, which falls under the category of cryptography (cs.CR). The use of GHW in bounding the state complexity of the trellis representation of the code suggests a connection to the theory of data structures (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the adaptation of proof techniques used for Reed-Muller codes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.SI). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of computational complexity (cs.CC) due to the use of upper and lower bounds."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
