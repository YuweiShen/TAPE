The paper specifically focuses on polar codes, which are a type of error-correcting code, and investigates their performance on the AWGN channel. This suggests that it could also belong to the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) category, as the design and analysis of efficient error-correcting codes can be a computationally complex task. The paper also proposes an explicit construction of polar codes for the AWGN channel, which involves a tradeoff between the gap to capacity and the decay rate of the error probability. This suggests that it could also belong to the cs.SI (Systems and Control) category, as the design of control systems often involves tradeoffs between different performance metrics. Additionally, the paper involves the use of multiple access channels and constellations, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) category. Finally, the paper involves the analysis of asymptotic behavior in the moderate deviations regime, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category, as the analysis of asymptotic behavior is often relevant in the context of statistical learning theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
