This involves designing efficient sampling algorithms that can explore a combinatorial query space within a finite budget limit. The paper proposes a Decision tree-based Thompson sampler (\\texttt{DT-TMP}) that exploits the correlation between queryable attributes and the population of interest and hierarchically orders the query space to efficiently discover the right combination of attributes to query. This work involves techniques from social network analysis, information retrieval, machine learning, and data mining, which are typically covered in the arXiv sub-categories of cs.SI, cs.IR, cs.SOC, cs.DB, and cs.AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
