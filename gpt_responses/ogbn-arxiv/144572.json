The device is designed to process sensory data for intelligence computing, decision-making, or context cognition. The paper discusses the plasticity mechanisms involved in the device and its flexible tuning of both short- and long-term plasticity. The device can take multiple pre-synaptic light stimuli via wavelength-division multiplexing and allows advanced optical processing through charge-trap-mediated optical coupling. Based on this information, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.ET (Emerging Technologies), cs.EM (Electromagnetism), cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), and cs.OH (Other Computer Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
