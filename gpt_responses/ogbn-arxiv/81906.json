It also involves the use of CT scans and the estimation of pelvic surfaces, which are relevant to medical imaging and biomechanical engineering (cs.ME). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential for reducing radiation exposure, which is a safety concern in robotics and control systems (cs.RO). The use of partial CT scans and extrapolation methods also involves mathematical modeling and simulation, which are relevant to scientific computing (cs.MM) and computational geometry (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
