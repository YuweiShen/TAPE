The use of multiple antennas and the analysis of the impact of cell size suggest that it could also be relevant to the Multimedia (cs.MM) and Architecture (cs.AR) categories. Finally, the consideration of power consumption and efficiency makes the System and Control (cs.SY) category a possibility as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
