The use of offline and online learning strategies also suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The incorporation of multiple annotated frames and the ability to handle different types of input annotations indicate a potential overlap with multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
