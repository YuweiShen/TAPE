The paper specifically focuses on Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents and proposes modeling wireheading as psychological disorders. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves the study of emergent addictive policies in Q-learning agents, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses safety problems in AI, which could fall under the sub-category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
