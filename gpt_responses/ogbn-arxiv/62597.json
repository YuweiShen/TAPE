The use of diacritics, kashida, and points above or under letters in Arabic text also suggests a multimedia focus. \n\n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper discusses protecting text from illegal use, which is a security concern. Watermarking is also a technique used in cryptography and security. \n\n3. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses methods for watermarking Arabic text, which could be relevant to information retrieval systems that need to protect the integrity of text data. \n\n4. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): While the paper does not explicitly mention computer vision or pattern recognition, watermarking is a technique that can be used in image and video processing, which are subfields of computer vision. \n\n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): While the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, watermarking is a technique that can be used in data-driven approaches to protect the integrity of data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
