This involves topics such as channel estimation, modulation, and multi-antenna systems, which are all related to information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the performance of the system under different conditions, which falls under the category of control and optimization (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper uses OFDM modulation and measures positions both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight, which are related to multimedia systems (cs.MM) and augmented reality (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
