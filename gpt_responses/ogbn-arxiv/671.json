These topics are central to the field of machine learning, which is covered by several arXiv CS sub-categories. However, given the focus on practical considerations and empirical evidence, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is the most likely sub-category. Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision), as these fields heavily rely on machine learning techniques. Additionally, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SE (Software Engineering) are possible sub-categories, as the paper discusses different methods for algorithm selection and evaluation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
