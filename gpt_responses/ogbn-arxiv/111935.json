Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves training language models, which falls under cs.LG (Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper also mentions the use of highlighted annotations, which suggests a potential application in computer vision, falling under cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
