The proposed measure of extractable shared information has applications in machine learning and data science (cs.LG), as well as in network analysis and graph theory (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the decomposition of mutual information, which is a topic in statistical inference (cs.SI) and communication complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
