It may also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category as it proposes a differentiable mesh renderer. The use of gradients for optimization suggests it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the use of anti-aliasing and pixel intensity may suggest it belongs to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
