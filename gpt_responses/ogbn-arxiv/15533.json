The proposed approach of representing data as points in a vector space and measuring relatedness through distance is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The use of machine learning to learn the best representation also falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
