However, given that the paper focuses on the use of analog processing to address the challenges of DSP power consumption and circuitry complexity, it is most likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Other likely sub-categories include Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Multimedia (cs.MM), and Computation and Language (cs.COM), as these subfields are also relevant to the topic of massive MIMO relaying."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
