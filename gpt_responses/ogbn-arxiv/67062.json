The paper also involves computer vision (cs.CV) as it conducts experiments on standard incremental learning benchmarks in computer vision. Additionally, the paper involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it proposes a new method for preserving knowledge in machine learning models. The paper also involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it mentions incorporating an auxiliary distillation to preserve knowledge encoded at the intermediate feature levels, which is a common technique in NLP. Finally, the paper involves neural networks (cs.NE) as it adapts mask-based pruning to reconstruct all previous models with a small memory footprint."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
