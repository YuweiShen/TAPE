The specific applications mentioned in the abstract, robotics control (cs.RO) and real-time strategy games, are also relevant subfields. The paper also discusses variance reduction techniques, which are relevant to the subfield of game theory (cs.GT) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
