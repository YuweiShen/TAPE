The paper also presents a static analysis for verifying safety properties of pi terms, which is a common concern in programming languages. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper proposes a static analysis for verifying safety properties of pi terms, which is a relevant topic in software engineering. The paper also discusses the decidable coverability problem for hierarchical terms, which is a common concern in software verification. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the shape invariants satisfied by the communication topology of pi terms, which can be seen as a type of data structure. The paper also presents a novel type system for inferring these invariants, which involves algorithmic reasoning. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper deals with the pi calculus, which is a formal language for describing concurrent and distributed systems.
