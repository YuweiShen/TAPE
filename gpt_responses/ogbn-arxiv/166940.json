This falls under the scope of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The proposed construction results in quasi-cyclic codes which are attractive in practice due to simple encoder and decoder implementation. This is relevant to networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper mentions the Tanner graph of the code, which is a graphical representation of the code's structure. This is relevant to social and information networks. \n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the design process of the code, which involves maximizing the components of the ACE spectrum in a greedy fashion. This may involve computational complexity considerations. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The proposed technique involves lifting a protograph cyclically to a certain block length of interest. This may involve data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
