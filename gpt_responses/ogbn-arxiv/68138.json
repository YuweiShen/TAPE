The main focus is on exploiting symmetry to reduce the dimensionality of the reachable sets, which is a topic closely related to the field of computational group theory (cs.GT) and symmetry reduction techniques (cs.SYM). The paper also uses dynamic programming (cs.DS) and robotics (cs.RO) concepts to illustrate the results with a reach-avoid game of two Dubins vehicles. Finally, the paper presents a general method for symmetry reduction based on the Cartan frame, which is a well-known tool in the study of Lie groups and Lie algebras (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
