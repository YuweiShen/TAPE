The focus is on AMR parsing, which falls under computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also discusses the use of neural networks for regression, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves ranking and selection of parsing systems, which could be considered information retrieval (cs.IR) tasks. Finally, the paper uses metrics to evaluate the accuracy of parsing, which could be related to neural networks (cs.NE) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
