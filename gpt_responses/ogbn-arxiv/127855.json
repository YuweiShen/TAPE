The paper discusses the use of random feature approximations and the challenges of applying them to large datasets. The proposed algorithm is based on doubly stochastic gradients and is applicable to a range of nonlinear component analysis problems, including kernel PCA, CCA, and SVD. The paper provides theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the algorithm and demonstrates its effectiveness on large-scale datasets. Given these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
