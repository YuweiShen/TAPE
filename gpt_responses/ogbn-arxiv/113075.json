This topic is closely related to computer vision (cs.CV) and information theory (cs.IT), as well as machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) due to the use of denoisers. Additionally, the paper mentions scalability to large datasets, which suggests numerical analysis (cs.NA) as another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
