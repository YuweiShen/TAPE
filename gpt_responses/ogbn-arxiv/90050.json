The paper proposes a new technique for filter pruning during training, which involves optimization and machine learning techniques, making it likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the computational complexity and energy consumption of networks, which are topics studied in the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed technique on image data for classification, object detection, and domain adaptation benchmarks, which are topics studied in the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
