The paper presents a theoretical framework for formulating the problem and provides new techniques for finding optimal sampling algorithms that are both statistically and information-theoretically optimal. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Information Theory (cs.IT), Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS), Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Computational Complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
