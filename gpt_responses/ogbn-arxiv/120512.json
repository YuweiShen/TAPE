The use of distributed antenna sets and the consideration of spatially correlated MIMO channels suggest a focus on networking and communications (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also mentions the use of random matrix theory, which is a common tool in machine learning and statistics (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with the capacity-achieving input covariance matrices, which is a topic related to optimization and control (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
