The paper also evaluates the proposed framework's performance in terms of training performance, which falls under the scope of machine learning. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of edge servers as intermediaries to perform partial model aggregation in proximity, which can reduce core network transmission overhead. This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a joint computation and communication resource allocation and edge association problem for device users under the HFEL framework to achieve global cost minimization. This falls under the scope of systems and control. \n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses FL, which is a distributed machine learning approach. The proposed HFEL framework also involves edge servers, which can be considered as a form of distributed computing. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses FL, which is a machine learning approach, and proposes a novel framework for FL. This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
