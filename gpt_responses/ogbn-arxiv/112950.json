Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the design of the calculus and its relation to Java 8, which suggests that it could also belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category. The paper also proves subject reduction and progress properties, which are related to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. The type inference algorithm presented in the paper suggests that it could also belong to the Types (cs.TY) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the role of intersection types, which could suggest that it belongs to the Computational Logic (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
