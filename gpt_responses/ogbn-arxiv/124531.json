This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The approach also involves working with large-scale knowledge bases, which is a common topic in database systems (cs.DB). Additionally, the paper discusses the evaluation of the learned rules, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
