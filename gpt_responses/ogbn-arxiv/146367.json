The paper also involves the use of clustering and binary classification models, which are common techniques in machine learning (cs.LG and cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of various networks such as Resnet and VGG, which are commonly used in multimedia applications (cs.MM). Finally, the paper involves the use of fusion techniques to combine high-level semantic features and low-level detail features, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
