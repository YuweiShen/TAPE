The paper proposes a framework for enhancing the robustness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which involves using hash functions and Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE) regularizer, both of which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also involves experimentation with Android malware classification, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE) and image processing, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
