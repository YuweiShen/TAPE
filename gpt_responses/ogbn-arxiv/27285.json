The paper proposes two frameworks to study this problem and provides positive results in both settings. The paper also provides implications for robust estimation in various settings. Given the focus on machine learning and statistics, as well as the use of optimization techniques, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT) in the context of learning from untrusted data. The paper also discusses the issue of security and adversarial attacks on data, which falls under the sub-category of cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes algorithms for robust learning, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
