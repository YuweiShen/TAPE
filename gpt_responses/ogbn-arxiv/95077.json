The paper introduces a new property called bigness over a finite domain and establishes lower bounds for testing bigness and monotonicity over different posets. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), cs.IT (information theory), cs.LG (machine learning), cs.CC (computational complexity), and cs.SI (social and information networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
