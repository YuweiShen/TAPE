The use of multiple antennas at each node suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the subfield of networked information theory (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of artificial noise to degrade the eavesdropper's signal, which is a technique commonly used in physical-layer security (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the proposed schemes in terms of SINR and BER, which are metrics commonly used in wireless communication and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
