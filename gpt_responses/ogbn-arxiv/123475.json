This is a common problem in information theory. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes a computationally efficient algorithm for image reconstruction, which involves the approximation of a Laplacian matrix. This is a common problem in numerical analysis. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the reconstruction of cardiac MR images, which is a common problem in multimedia applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
