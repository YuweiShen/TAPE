Therefore, cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also involves some algebraic techniques, which suggest that it could be classified under cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) or cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Finally, the paper discusses some results related to differential uniformity, which is a topic in number theory, making cs.NT (Number Theory) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
