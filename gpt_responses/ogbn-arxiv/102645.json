The paper proposes an approach to overcome this limitation while preserving the logical underpinnings of the system. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages) is also a likely category as the paper discusses the development of schematic proof rules that accommodate schematic polymorphism in the core logic of Abella and in the executable specification logic that it embeds. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering) is a possible category as the paper discusses the development of an updated version of the Abella system that accommodates schematic polymorphism. \n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) is a possible category as the paper discusses the use of Abella for reasoning about relational specifications, which can be seen as a formal language. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is a possible category as the paper discusses the development of an approach that allows object constructors and other relevant logical notions to be parameterized by types, which can be seen as a data structure."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
