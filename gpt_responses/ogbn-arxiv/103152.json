This is related to information theory and model selection. \n- cs.ST (Statistics): The paper proposes a Bayesian approach for tensor factorization and models the sparse tensor by a hierarchical view of Student-t distribution, which is a statistical method for modeling heavy-tailed distributions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
