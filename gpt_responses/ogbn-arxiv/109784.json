The paper also discusses the limitations of the original Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit (NALU) model and proposes solutions, which could be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) tasks that involve mathematical operations. Additionally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed model empirically, which could be relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) tasks that involve numerical reasoning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
