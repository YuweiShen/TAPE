The paper also deals with optimization problems, which are relevant to the subfields of machine learning (cs.LG) and data structures (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper proposes a simple update rule for parameter selection, which could be relevant to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
