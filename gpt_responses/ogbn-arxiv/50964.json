The paper also discusses MSE lower bounds, which are commonly used in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a new definition for unbiasedness in constrained settings, which could be relevant to optimization and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the simulations in the paper involve linear and nonlinear estimation problems, which could fall under the subfield of statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
