The paper also discusses the use of perception and modeling to handle uncertainties, which suggests a possible connection to computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also proposes a motion planning algorithm and a control strategy, which are relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the mechanical design of the gripper, which could be related to machine learning (cs.LG) for optimizing the design."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
