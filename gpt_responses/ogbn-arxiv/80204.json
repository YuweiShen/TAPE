The paper also discusses deep learning-based methods (cs.LG) for grasp detection and motion planning, and reinforcement learning-based methods (cs.SY) for motion planning. Therefore, cs.RO, cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG, and cs.SY are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
