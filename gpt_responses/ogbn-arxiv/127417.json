This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n2. cs.RO (Robotics): The proposed controller can be applied to a large class of mechanical systems, including underactuated systems with non-constant mass matrix. This makes it relevant to robotics.\n3. cs.ME (Mechanical Engineering): The paper deals with the control of mechanical systems and presents a method to robustify energy-shaping controllers for port-Hamiltonian systems. This makes it relevant to mechanical engineering.\n4. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper presents a computational method for controlling port-Hamiltonian systems and rejecting unknown additive disturbances. This makes it relevant to computational engineering.\n5. cs.DS (Dynamical Systems): The paper deals with the control of dynamical systems and presents a method to robustify energy-shaping controllers for port-Hamiltonian systems.
