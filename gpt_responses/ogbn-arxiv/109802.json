The paper also discusses the use of pre-trained CNNs as generic feature extractors, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper explores the feature aspect of CNNs, which is a key area of research in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of Random Forests and SVMs, which are popular machine learning algorithms (cs.NE).
