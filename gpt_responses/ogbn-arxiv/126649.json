This involves computer vision (CV) techniques for processing the images, as well as robotics (RO) and machine learning (LG) for the development of the deep neural network. Additionally, the use of deep learning for risk assessment involves artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Finally, the paper also deals with the security and privacy (CR) implications of using such systems in vehicles."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
