The paper proposes new models for learning in temporal knowledge graphs, which involves machine learning techniques such as tensor factorization and embedding models, which are commonly used in the field of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with natural language processing, as it uses the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) dataset, which is a large-scale database of news articles from around the world (cs.CL). The paper also involves database management, as it deals with storing and querying knowledge graphs (cs.DB). Finally, the paper deals with cognitive science, as it proposes a hypothesis about the relationship between episodic and semantic memory (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
