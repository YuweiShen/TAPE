The paper focuses on the optimization of additive criteria such as delay and cost, which are important in the context of network design. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.RO (Robotics and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
