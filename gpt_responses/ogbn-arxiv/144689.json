The paper also discusses the use of deep learning features, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of a verifier to check tracking results, which involves decision-making and could fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on popular tracking benchmarks, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
