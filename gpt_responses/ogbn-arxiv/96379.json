The technique incorporates several methods designed to automate the process of categorizing buildings based on their key physical attributes and rapidly assessing their post-event structural condition. This involves the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for scene classification and a probabilistic approach to fuse the results obtained from analyzing several images. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper also involves the use of probabilistic methods and machine learning algorithms, which are relevant to the sub-categories of cryptography and security (cs.CR) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
