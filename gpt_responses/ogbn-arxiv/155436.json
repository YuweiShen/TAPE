It also involves computing the geometrical location of objects, which falls under robotics (cs.RO). The proposed system uses an RNN framework, which is a popular machine learning technique and falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with constructing scene graphs, which is related to graph theory (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
