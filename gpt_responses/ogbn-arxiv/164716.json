This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The proposed concept of Data Fine-tuning involves perturbing the input data to improve classification accuracy without changing the model parameters, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve publicly available datasets, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the concept of adversarial perturbations is mentioned, which is related to computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
