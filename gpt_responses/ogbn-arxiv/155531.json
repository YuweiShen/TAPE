This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n- cs.CR: The paper discusses the use of the system for maritime monitoring, which is a critical application for ensuring safety and security. This falls under the scope of computer security and cryptography.\n- cs.LG: The paper presents a library of maritime patterns developed in collaboration with domain experts for effective recognition. This involves the use of machine learning techniques and falls under the scope of machine learning and pattern recognition.\n- cs.CV: The paper uses real-world datasets of vessel position streams and static geographical information for evaluation. This involves the use of computer vision techniques and falls under the scope of computer vision and pattern recognition.\n- cs.DC: The paper discusses the computational efficiency of the system and the patterns. This involves the use of distributed computing techniques and falls under the scope of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
