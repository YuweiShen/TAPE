Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper proposes a novel approach to address this problem by splitting the network into a classifier part and a feature extractor part and employing different training strategies for each part. This approach involves using class-balanced sampling and an auxiliary training task, which are common techniques in machine learning and artificial intelligence, respectively. Therefore, the paper could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), or cs.CL (Computation and Language). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on visual data, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
