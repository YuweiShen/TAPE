The use of near-infrared (NIR) information also involves the study of material properties and their reflection in the NIR spectrum, which falls under the sub-field of machine learning for material recognition (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the physical properties of the NIR response, which is related to the sub-field of information retrieval (cs.IR). The study of how to best incorporate the specific characteristics of the NIR response into a segmentation framework involves the use of machine learning techniques, which is a sub-field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper presents a novel manually segmented image database, which is related to the sub-field of machine learning for data annotation (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
