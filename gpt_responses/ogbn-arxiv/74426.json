The algorithm is based on a reduction to no regret online learning, which is a common approach in the optimization and control communities. Therefore, the paper is likely to be relevant to the following arXiv CS sub-categories, in order of likelihood: cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
