Additionally, the paper discusses the use of policies and ensembles, which are common topics in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also evaluates its approach on control tasks, which suggests that it could fall under the categories of robotics (cs.RO) or systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions the use of Atari 2600 and Mujoco, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks, suggesting that it could also fall under the category of computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
