The paper also discusses the impact of the number of antennas on the covert communication rate, which falls under the category of massive MIMO (cs.MM). The paper also assumes channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter, which is a common topic in network information theory (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the optimal input covariance matrix, which is a topic in control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
