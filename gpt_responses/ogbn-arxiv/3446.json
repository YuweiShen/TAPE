Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques for landmark selection, which could fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper deals with the practical implementation of the system, which could fall under cs.RO (Robotics) or cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
