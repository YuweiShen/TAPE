It is also likely to belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) because it uses recurrent neural networks to simulate language acquisition. Additionally, it could belong to the sub-categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) because of the use of neural networks.
