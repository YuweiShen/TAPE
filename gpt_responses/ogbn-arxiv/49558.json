This involves using neural networks to map the embeddings into a new representation that is visually aligned. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV), followed by natural language processing (cs.CL) since the paper deals with word embeddings. Machine learning (cs.LG) is also likely since the paper proposes an objective function to learn the mapping. Artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR) are also possible sub-categories since the paper deals with improving the performance of ZSL methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
