Therefore, cs.DB (Databases) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the complexity of computation and approximation, which are common themes in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of negation in CQs also suggests a connection to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
