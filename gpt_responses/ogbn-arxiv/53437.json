The paper also involves the study of algebraic structures and functions over finite fields, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The use of butterflies as a structure for constructing permutations is related to the field of combinatorics and discrete mathematics (cs.SD). The paper also involves the study of algebraic degree and nonlinearity, which are topics in algebra and number theory (cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes new constructions for block ciphers, which is related to the field of computer security (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
