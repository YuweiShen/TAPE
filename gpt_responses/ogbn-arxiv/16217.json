The concept of confluence is also related to the study of graph theory and algorithms (cs.DS), and the paper presents complexity results for determining whether a graph has a strict confluent drawing, which is a problem in computational complexity (cs.CC). Additionally, the paper involves combinatorial arguments and proofs, which are techniques commonly used in discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the paper discusses the concept of outerplanar drawings, which is a topic in graph theory and topology (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
