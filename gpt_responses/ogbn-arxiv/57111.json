The proposed solution involves the use of intelligent agents, which is a key aspect of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of different semantic search engines, which involves the management and retrieval of data, falling under the category of Databases (cs.DB). The use of natural language processing and semantic analysis, as mentioned in the paper, falls under the category of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper proposes the use of cloud computing for the development of the search engine, which involves the use of distributed systems and machine learning, falling under the category of Deep Learning (cs.DL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
