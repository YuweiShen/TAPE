The paper specifically focuses on local algorithms, which are a subset of distributed algorithms that operate on a small neighborhood of each node in the network. This makes cs.AL (Algorithms) another likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the coloring problem, which falls under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks).
