The paper also discusses the use of deep learning techniques, which is a topic that falls under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of regularisation techniques, which is a topic that falls under the sub-category of computer vision (cs.CV) and optimization (cs.SD).
