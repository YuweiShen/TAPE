The experiments are also conducted on a swarm of real MAVs, indicating a strong focus on robotics. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Particle Swarm Optimisation is an optimisation algorithm that falls under the umbrella of AI. The paper proposes a modification to the original PSO algorithm, indicating a focus on AI. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes an algorithm for controlling a swarm of MAVs to locate a target goal point, indicating a focus on systems and control. \n4. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems): The paper proposes an algorithm for enabling a swarm of robots to work together to locate a target goal point, indicating a focus on multi-agent systems. \n5. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): Although not a primary focus of the paper, computer vision may be used in conjunction with the proposed algorithm to aid in the detection of the target goal point."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
