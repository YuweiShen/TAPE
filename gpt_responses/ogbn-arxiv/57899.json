The paper also discusses the property of subject reduction, which is a key concept in software engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper mentions subtyping, which is a topic in both programming languages and computational logic (cs.CL). Finally, the paper's focus on parametric polymorphism and subtyping suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
