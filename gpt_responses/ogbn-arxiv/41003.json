This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also involves network remodelling techniques and comparing various result metrics, which suggests involvement of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The application of the network is in autonomous driving, which falls under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the use of a neural network suggests involvement of the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
