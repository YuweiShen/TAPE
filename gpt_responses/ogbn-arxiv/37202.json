This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), signal processing (cs.SP), matrix multiplication (cs.MM), and statistical inference (cs.SI). The paper proposes a Bayesian approximate message passing algorithm that exploits temporal correlations in the amplitudes of non-zero coefficients, and provides soft estimates of the signal vectors as well as the underlying support. The algorithm has a linear computational complexity and is suitable for high-dimensional problems. The paper also describes an expectation-maximization algorithm for automatic parameter tuning. Overall, the paper covers a broad range of topics in computer science and is likely to be relevant to multiple arXiv CS sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
