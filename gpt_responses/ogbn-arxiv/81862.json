The algorithm uses a centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) to partition the feature space into a desired number of regions. This paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes an extension to an evolutionary algorithm, MAP-Elites, to improve its scalability in high-dimensional feature spaces. This falls under the scope of neural and evolutionary computing.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the new algorithm in maze navigation and hexapod locomotion tasks, which are robotics-related applications.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning algorithm, MAP-Elites, and introduces an extension to improve its scalability.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an algorithm that falls under the scope of artificial intelligence, as it involves evolutionary computation and optimization.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper's focus on improving the scalability of an algorithm for robotics-related applications falls under the scope of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
