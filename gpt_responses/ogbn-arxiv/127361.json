This falls under the domain of machine learning and artificial intelligence, which are covered by several sub-categories in arXiv CS. Specifically, the paper focuses on meta-learning, which is a subfield of machine learning concerned with learning how to learn. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision) since these sub-categories are closely related to the topic of the paper. Additionally, since the paper deals with resampling methods, which are commonly used in data science, the sub-categories cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
