The paper introduces a compressed representation framework for non-linear CCA, which extends the classical ACE approach. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also establishes fundamental connections to rate-distortion theory, the information bottleneck, and remote source coding, which are sub-fields of Information Theory (cs.IT). The paper also mentions real-world applications, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) or Computer Vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper introduces a simple implementation of the CRCCA framework, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of Signal Processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
