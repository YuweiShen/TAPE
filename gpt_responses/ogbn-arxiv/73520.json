Computer Vision (cs.CV) is also a likely category as the algorithms are based on observed trajectory data. Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) are also possible categories as the paper discusses the use of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to infer pedestrian intentions and predict future trajectories. Finally, the Systems and Control (cs.SY) category is also a possibility as the paper deals with the development of algorithms for autonomous systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
