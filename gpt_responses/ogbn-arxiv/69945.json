This involves designing both passive and active attacks that solicit ratings for strategically selected items, and could thus be used by a recommender system to pursue this hidden agenda. The methods are based on a novel usage of Bayesian matrix factorization in an active learning setting. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
