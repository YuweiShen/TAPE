The paper also discusses the use of cyclic lifting to create finite codes with low frame error rate, which is related to coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also discusses the stopping set analysis, which is a topic related to network information theory (cs.NI) and system theory (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the construction of irregular codes, which is related to distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
