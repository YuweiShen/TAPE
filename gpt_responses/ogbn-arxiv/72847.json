The paper discusses the challenges of training language models on datasets of different sizes and introduces a new dataset called SimpleBooks for word-level language modeling. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the need for new architectures and techniques for faster and better training of language models, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the use of LSTM and Transformer models, which are deep learning architectures, falling under the sub-category of cs.DL (Deep Learning). Finally, the paper discusses the use of SimpleBooks for architectural search, which falls under the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
