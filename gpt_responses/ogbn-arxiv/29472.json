The paper also discusses the potential for clients to infer information about other clients, which is a security concern (cs.CR). The proposed solution involves limiting the access of clients to the coding matrix, which is a problem in distributed systems (cs.DS) and privacy-preserving data analysis (cs.SI). Finally, the paper develops deterministic designs for the proposed scheme, which is a problem in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
