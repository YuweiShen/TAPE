This involves the use of bounding techniques to avoid most DTW computations. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), information retrieval (cs.IR), databases (cs.DB), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
