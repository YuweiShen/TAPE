This technique is related to information theory. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents a Las Vegas randomized algorithm for interpolation over large finite fields that uses fewer black box evaluations. This algorithm is based on new techniques and does not rely on root finding as a subroutine. \n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the complexity of the interpolation problem and presents an improved algorithm that uses fewer black box evaluations. \n- cs.SC (Symbolic Computation): The paper deals with the problem of interpolating an unknown multivariate polynomial with coefficients taken from a finite field or as numerical approximations of complex numbers. This problem is related to symbolic computation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
