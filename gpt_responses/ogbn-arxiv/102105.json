The authors also consider the use of multiple searchers and the optimization of their search strategy, which is a problem in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves the analysis of the speed-up achieved by non-coordinating search algorithms, which is a problem in information theory (cs.IT) and game theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper discusses the use of logarithmic memory in the search algorithms, which is a problem in distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
