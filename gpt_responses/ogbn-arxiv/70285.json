The proposed method involves unsupervised image generation and adaptation, which also involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The applications of object detection in thermal images include unmanned vehicles and robotics (cs.RO), and surveillance and night vision (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
