The proposed method involves a learned transform for reducing spatial redundancy, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also mentions the use of predictive coding and temporal DCT, which are commonly used in signal processing and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses the tradeoff between latency and compression performance, which is a common concern in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
