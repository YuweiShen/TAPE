This approach involves leveraging the physical characteristics of SOT devices to represent configured functionalities by magnetization states, making it essentially impossible to identify the obfuscated gate. This approach is related to emerging technologies (cs.ET), computer architecture (cs.AR), cryptography and security (cs.CR), electromagnetics (cs.EM), and embedded systems (cs.ES)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
