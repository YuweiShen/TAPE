This suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and information retrieval (IR) techniques for data analysis and targeting. The paper also discusses the need for stability and control in RTB campaigns, which could fall under distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (DC) or systems and control (SI) categories. Finally, the paper proposes an optimisation framework for campaign performance, which could involve machine learning (LG) techniques for model training and optimisation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
