The paper proposes a new model for preference estimation with discrete values and graph side information, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of graph side information in recommender systems, which is a common problem in information retrieval (cs.IR) and social networks (cs.SI). The paper also develops a computationally-efficient algorithm, which falls under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
