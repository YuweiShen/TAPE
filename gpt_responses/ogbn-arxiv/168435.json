The paper focuses on the use of optical flow and stereo vision for velocity estimation and obstacle avoidance. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is Robotics (cs.RO), followed by Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves machine learning techniques for obstacle avoidance, which makes it relevant to the Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the integration of sensors and hardware limitations, which makes it relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
