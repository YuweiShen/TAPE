It proposes a new method called TP-resolution that combines loop checking and tabling to establish a linear tabulated resolution. This work is highly relevant to the field of programming languages (cs.PL) and logic (cs.LO). It also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it aims to improve the efficiency of logic programming. The proposed algorithm can be implemented by extending existing Prolog abstract machines, which falls under the category of computer systems and networking (cs.SE). Finally, the paper presents a new approach to handle cuts, which is related to data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
