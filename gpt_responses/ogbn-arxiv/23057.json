The paper also discusses navigation and mapping capabilities of autonomous vehicles, which falls under robotics (cs.RO). The use of time-resolved single-photon imaging systems and the development of algorithms for inverse light transport suggest a focus on graphics (cs.GR). The paper also introduces a novel factored NLOS light transport representation, which could potentially involve machine learning techniques (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the simulation and experimental results of the proposed approach, which could involve computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
