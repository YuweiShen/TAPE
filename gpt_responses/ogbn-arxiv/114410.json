The paper proposes a novel test adequacy criterion for DL systems, which is based on the behaviour of DL systems with respect to their training data. This involves measuring the surprise of an input as the difference in DL system's behaviour between the input and the training data. This suggests that the paper could also fall under the categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also evaluates the proposed criterion using a range of DL systems from simple image classifiers to autonomous driving car platforms, which suggests that it could fall under the categories of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
