The most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper focuses on learning algorithms for RL agents. The second likely category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as RL is a subfield of AI. The third likely category is cs.RO (Robotics), as RL is often used in robotics applications. The fourth likely category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), as RL is also used in control systems. The fifth likely category is cs.DL (Deep Learning), as the paper uses deep neural networks to estimate uncertainty."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
