Additionally, the comparison of two computer vision techniques, Google Cloud Vision and AWS Rekognition, suggests that the paper may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of machine learning algorithms for image recognition and analysis also suggests that the paper may belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the use of mobile devices for meter reading suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
