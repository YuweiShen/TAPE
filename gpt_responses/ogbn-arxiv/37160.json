Specifically, the paper focuses on denoising autoencoders, which are commonly used in computer vision and natural language processing tasks. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), as the paper discusses both classical and distributed denoising autoencoders."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
