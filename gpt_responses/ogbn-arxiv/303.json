This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the connection between the proposed activation function and a stochastic regularizer, which is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The empirical evaluation includes tasks related to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
