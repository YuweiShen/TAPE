The paper also proposes a new neural model with local parameter sharing and spatial 2D-LSTM recurrent layers, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper focuses on the detection of text in document images, which is a subfield of natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR).
