The paper also investigates the medium access control (MAC) as a means of increasing the viability of the spectrum sharing technique. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). \n\nThe paper also discusses the concept of opportunity probability (OP) and its application to duplexing. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-category. \n\nFurthermore, the paper discusses the security implications of spectrum sharing, which may place it in the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category. \n\nThe proposed hybrid half duplex (HD)/full duplex (FD) communication approach may also place the paper in the cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the numerical analysis and implementation of the proposed approach, which may place it in the cs.MM (Multimedia) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
