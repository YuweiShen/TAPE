The paper also mentions the adoption of AI principles from the Duckietown community, indicating a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of simulation (Gazebo) and comparison of different approaches (model-based vs. learning-based) suggests a focus on system and control (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the mention of localization services suggests a possible focus on computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
