Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also uses tools from information theory (cs.IT), neural networks (cs.NE), and optimization (cs.SI), which are all relevant to the topic. Additionally, the paper proposes a new technique for deriving convergence bounds based on Rademacher complexities, which is related to the field of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
