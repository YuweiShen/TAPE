The focus on robustness and ambiguity sets suggests that it may also be relevant to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the use of value function estimates and sampling bounds suggests that it may involve data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
