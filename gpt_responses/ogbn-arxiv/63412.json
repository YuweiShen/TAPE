It specifically focuses on the problem of decoding with a suboptimal maximum-metric decoding rule, which falls under the category of information theory and probability (cs.ITP). The paper also introduces a new random-coding ensemble with multiple auxiliary costs, which could potentially fall under the category of signal processing (cs.SI). The use of saddlepoint approximations is a common technique in numerical analysis and optimization (cs.NA), and the paper uses this technique to obtain asymptotic estimates of non-asymptotic bounds. Finally, the paper also discusses error exponents and second-order rates, which are topics in mathematical modeling (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
