The most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper deals with model-free reinforcement learning. The next likely category is cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), as the paper proposes a new reward shaping approach for reinforcement learning. The paper also touches upon topics related to robotics (cs.RO), control systems (cs.SY), and data structures (cs.DS), as it discusses the use of B\\\"uchi automata and their translation to reachability."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
