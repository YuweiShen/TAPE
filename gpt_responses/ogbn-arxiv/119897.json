Information theory is closely related to coding theory and encryption, making this category a likely fit. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper proposes new cryptosystems and provides a security proof, which are both topics within the scope of this category. \n3. cs.CC (Computational Complexity) - The paper discusses the difficulty of decoding random families of quasi-cyclic codes, which is a topic within computational complexity. \n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - While less likely, this category could be relevant as the paper discusses the practical implications of the proposed cryptosystems, such as their efficiency and suitability for key exchange and authentication. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - While also less likely, this category could be relevant as the paper proposes a framework for constructing encryption schemes based on coding theory, which involves the use of algorithms and data structures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
