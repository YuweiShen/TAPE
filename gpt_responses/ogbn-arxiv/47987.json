It also involves the use of entropy and information theory (cs.IT) to determine edge weights in the graph corresponding to the Hasse diagram of the partition lattice. The paper may also be relevant to social network analysis and community detection (cs.SI) as clustering results are often used to identify communities in networks. Finally, the paper discusses the use of symmetric and order-preserving/inverting partition functions, which may be of interest to researchers in computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
