The paper discusses algorithms for this problem and provides theoretical analysis and experimental results on logistic regression and AUC maximization. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
