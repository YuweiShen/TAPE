The use of graph widths is also a key aspect of the paper. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Other likely sub-categories include cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
