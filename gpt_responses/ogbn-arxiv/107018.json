The paper proposes a novel Federated Multi-Task Learning framework that exploits geometric properties of the FL loss surface to group the client population into clusters with jointly trainable data distributions. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data. The paper proposes a novel Federated Multi-Task Learning framework that aims to improve the performance of Federated Learning, which is a subfield of Machine Learning.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms, systems, and architectures for distributed, parallel, and cluster computing. The paper proposes a Federated Multi-Task Learning framework that is distributed across multiple clients and can be implemented in a privacy-preserving way.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms and models for computer vision and pattern recognition tasks. The paper verifies the proposed framework on commonly used Federated Learning datasets that involve computer vision tasks.\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category deals with the study of algorithms and models for natural language processing and computational linguistics. Although the paper does not explicitly deal with natural language processing, the proposed framework"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
