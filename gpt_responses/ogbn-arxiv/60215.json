Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The paper also involves software engineering and system building, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.SE (Software Engineering). The use of the Transaction Synchronization eXtension (TSX) and cache misses also indicates that the paper could be relevant to cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.AR (Architecture)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
