This involves analyzing links between websites and images, which is a common task in information retrieval.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision) - The paper involves analyzing images and classifying them as adult or not. This is a task that falls under computer vision.\n3. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - The paper mentions using a text-based website classifier to initialize scores for website vertices. This involves natural language processing, which is a subfield of computation and language.\n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper describes an iterative algorithm for propagating scores within a website-image graph. This involves designing and analyzing algorithms, which is a key area of data structures and algorithms.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with analyzing and classifying images, which is a task that falls under multimedia."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
