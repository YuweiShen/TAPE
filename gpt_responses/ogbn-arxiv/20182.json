The paper also mentions the use of MS-COCO images, which is a popular dataset in computer vision research. Additionally, the paper could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as it uses deep learning techniques for image homography estimation. The paper also mentions the end-to-end training of the network, which is a common approach in deep learning. The robotics (cs.RO) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper mentions the use of homography estimation in robotics applications. Finally, the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category could also be relevant as the paper discusses the use of deep homography estimation in various applications such as image stitching and virtual reality."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
