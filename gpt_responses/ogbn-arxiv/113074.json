It also involves optimization of encoding bitrate for efficient transport of compressed video, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM). The use of CNNs for classification involves machine learning techniques, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the trade-off between accuracy and bitrate, which is a topic related to information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper deals with video compression and transport, which is a topic related to cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
