It could also belong to Information Retrieval (cs.IR) because keyword extraction is a common task in IR. The use of complex networks and graph-based methods suggests it could also belong to Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) or Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the use of a binary classifier and the balancing of the training set suggest it could also belong to the Deep Learning (cs.DL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
