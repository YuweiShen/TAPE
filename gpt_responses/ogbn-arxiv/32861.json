The paper also proposes a novel approach to reduce the memory footprint of segmentation networks, which involves hierarchical processing and flexible inference schemes, so it could also fit into the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) categories. The use of quadtrees and sparse convolutions in the proposed approach suggests that it could also be relevant to the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) category. Finally, the datasets used for evaluation include Cityscapes, SUN-RGBD, and ADE20k, which are all related to scene understanding and analysis, so the paper could also be relevant to the cs.GR (Graphics) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
