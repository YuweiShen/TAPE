The paper discusses the application of state-of-the-art MARL methods for congestion problems, which falls under the sub-category of Multi-agent Systems (cs.MA). The paper also discusses the use of difference rewards and resource abstraction, which are techniques used in Reinforcement Learning (RL), a subfield of AI and ML. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following sub-categories: cs.MA, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.SY, cs.NE."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
