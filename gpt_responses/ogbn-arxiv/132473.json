This involves applying an algorithm to segment the tumor, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV). The method is based on a modification of a scheme used for glioblastoma multiforme segmentation, which involves machine learning techniques (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) for evaluation, which is a common metric in machine learning and computer vision (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with medical imaging, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
