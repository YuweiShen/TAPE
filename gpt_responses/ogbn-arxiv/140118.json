The paper reviews over forty representative transfer learning approaches from the perspectives of data and model, and also briefly introduces the applications of transfer learning. The experimental results are performed on three different datasets, i.e., Amazon Reviews, Reuters-21578, and Office-31. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
