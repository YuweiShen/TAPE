The focus is on extending the coherence-based conditions for exact support recovery, which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the impact of decay on the recovery conditions, which is relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SP). Additionally, the paper presents numerical experiments to validate the proposed conditions, which involves solving optimization problems, and hence, falls under numerical analysis (cs.NA) and scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
