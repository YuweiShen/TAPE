The focus on maximum likelihood estimation and the use of finite data examples suggests that the paper would be relevant to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), statistics (cs.STAT), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
