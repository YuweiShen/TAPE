Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on several tracking datasets, which is a common practice in the computer vision community. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as tracking is a crucial task in robotics, and the proposed method can potentially improve the performance of robots that rely on visual tracking. \n\nThe paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it introduces a new method that is based on the assumption that the feature map can be used to estimate the tracking confidence more accurately. \n\nThe paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it proposes a new method for real-time tracking that can potentially improve the performance of AI systems that rely on visual tracking. \n\nFinally, the paper may be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category as it proposes a new method for tracking objects in videos, which is a common multimedia task."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
