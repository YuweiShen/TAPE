This falls under the scope of natural language processing and computational linguistics, which are subfields of CS.CL.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The proposed method involves training a model to jointly represent sentiment information in two languages using monolingual word embeddings and a small bilingual lexicon. This falls under the scope of machine learning, which is a subfield of CS.LG.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for cross-lingual sentiment classification that uses machine learning techniques and does not require annotated data in the target language. This falls under the scope of artificial intelligence, which is a subfield of CS.AI.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves experiments on cross-lingual sentiment classification, which is a task related to information retrieval. This falls under the scope of information retrieval, which is a subfield of CS.IR.\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper does not directly address social or ethical issues related to computing, but it does have implications for sentiment analysis in low-resource languages, which could have social and cultural implications.
