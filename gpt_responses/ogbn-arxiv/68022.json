The use of expert systems and classifiers like random forest is also a common theme in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) research. The concept of assigning authority to a reliable source is related to social influence (SI) and trust modeling. Finally, the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques for entity resolution and selection criteria for completing a profile is related to computational linguistics (CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
