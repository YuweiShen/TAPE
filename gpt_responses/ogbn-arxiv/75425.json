The method is inspired by attention methods (cs.AI) and involves joint training with the main network (cs.NE). The paper also evaluates the proposed method on benchmark problems involving image classification (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
