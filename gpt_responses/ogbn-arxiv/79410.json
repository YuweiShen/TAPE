Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses different approaches to training multilingual NMT models, such as fine-tuning and training from scratch, which are related to machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper mentions the use of encoder and decoder layers in NMT models, which is related to computer vision (CV) and image processing. Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
