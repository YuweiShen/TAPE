This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper addresses the problem of outlier measurements, which is a common issue in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.AI). The use of Bayesian estimation also suggests a potential fit with the Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on practical running times and optimization suggests a potential fit with the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
