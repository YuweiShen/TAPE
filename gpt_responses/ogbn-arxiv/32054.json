The paper proposes new strategyproof mechanisms and provides upper bounds on their competitive ratios. This makes it likely to belong to the cs.GT (Game Theory) and cs.EC (Economics and Computation) categories. The paper also uses an analytic approach and proposes a new subclass of mechanisms, which suggests it could belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) categories. Finally, the paper uses linear programming and partial allocation mechanisms, which could make it relevant to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
