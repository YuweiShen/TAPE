The paper also discusses the management of interference and coupling, which is a common problem in Information Theory (cs.IT). The use of arrays and beamforming is a topic that is relevant to both Computer Architecture (cs.AR) and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the proposed solution involves reconfigurability, which is a key aspect of Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
