This involves numerical methods and computations, which falls under the scope of numerical analysis. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): Kernel matrices are commonly used in machine learning, and the paper mentions their use in this field. The empirical study also includes real-world datasets used in machine learning. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper describes a new factorization scheme for kernel matrices and derives complexity estimates. This involves designing and analyzing algorithms and data structures. \n- cs.SC (Scientific Computing): The paper mentions the use of kernel matrices in computational physics, which falls under the scope of scientific computing. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the use of shared and distributed memory parallelism in the empirical study, and reports results on large-scale parallel runs.
