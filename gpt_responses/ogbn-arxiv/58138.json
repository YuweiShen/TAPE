The use of convex programming for robust estimation is a popular technique in machine learning and optimization, which suggests the paper may belong to cs.CV or cs.LG. The experiments on Internet photo collections suggest the paper may also belong to cs.GR or cs.MM. Finally, the problem of camera motion estimation is related to the problem of structure from motion, which is a well-studied problem in robotics and computer vision, suggesting the paper may also belong to cs.RO."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
