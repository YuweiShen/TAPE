This suggests that the paper may belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms sub-category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes efficient local search algorithms for the GTSP, which involves optimization and decision-making. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Artificial Intelligence sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes new neighborhoods for the GTSP, which may involve learning from data. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Machine Learning sub-category.\n4. cs.RO (Robotics): The GTSP has applications in robotics, such as path planning for robots. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Robotics sub-category.\n5. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper proposes a genetic algorithm for the GTSP, which involves evolutionary computing.
