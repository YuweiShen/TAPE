The use of polynomial sequences and partial derivatives also suggests a connection to algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, which are relevant to cs.AG (algebraic geometry) and cs.AC (commutative algebra). However, since the focus of the paper is on computational complexity and the use of polynomial sequences, we consider cs.CC, cs.DS, cs.IT, cs.LO, and cs.SC to be the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
