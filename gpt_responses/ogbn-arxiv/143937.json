The algorithms presented in the paper involve techniques such as dynamic programming and branching, which are commonly used in computational geometry (cs.CG) and parameterized complexity (cs.CC). The lower bounds presented in the paper rely on the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), which is a central conjecture in computational complexity theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
