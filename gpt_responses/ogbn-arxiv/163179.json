The paper also discusses the integration of aspect ratio and context, which are important factors in object detection and can be considered as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The proposed method involves a mixture of object models and region-based convolutional networks, which is a machine learning (cs.LG) approach. The paper also presents experimental results on two datasets, which can be categorized as multimedia (cs.MM) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
