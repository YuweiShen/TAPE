The use of interleaving method and cyclotomic classes also suggests a possible connection to data structures (cs.DS) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper involves the construction of sequences for code-division multiple access communication systems, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
