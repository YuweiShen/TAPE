The paper proposes a new approach to solving this problem using locality sensitive hashing, which is a technique commonly used in data structures and algorithms. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.DB (Databases). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of embeddings, which are commonly used in natural language processing, suggesting that cs.CL (Computation and Language) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper presents time and space complexity analyses, which are common in machine learning and statistics, suggesting that cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
