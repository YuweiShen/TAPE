The paper also mentions the use of a translation network, which is a common technique in multimedia (MM) research. The proposed framework involves automatic hallucination of HDR details, which is a task that can be achieved through artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Finally, the paper involves extensive comparisons and evaluations, which are common in machine learning (LG) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
