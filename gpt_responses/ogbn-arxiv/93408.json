The use of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) and relative sensing framework suggests that this paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper deals with control laws and mathematical models, which are relevant to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. The use of optimization techniques and real-time iteration suggests that this paper may also belong to the Mathematical Optimization (cs.MA) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of AI techniques such as formation control, which suggests that it may belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with evaluation of results, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
