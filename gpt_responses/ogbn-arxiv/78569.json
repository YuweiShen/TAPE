The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detection also supports this categorization. The paper also involves robotics (cs.RO) as it uses two perception platforms (a tractor and a pickup truck) to capture the stereo video. Machine learning (cs.LG) is another likely category as the paper discusses the use of different approaches for detection, including CNNs and other leading approaches from urban pedestrian detection. Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) is also a possible category as the paper deals with the development of a benchmark dataset for person detection in off-road and agricultural environments. Information Retrieval (cs.IR) is a less likely category, but still possible as the paper involves the use of meta-data for targeted evaluation of different effects."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
