This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of auxiliary FCNNs for additional supervision and the concatenating framework for multi-scale feature integration suggest a focus on deep learning techniques, which also aligns with the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of immunofluorescent images for experimentation suggests a focus on medical imaging, which aligns with the information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
