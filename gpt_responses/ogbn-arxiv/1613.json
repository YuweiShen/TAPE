The use of optimization algorithms and achievable rate analysis suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the application of the research to the ATSC 3.0 standard suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
