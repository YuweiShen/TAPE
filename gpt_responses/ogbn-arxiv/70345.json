The method relies on independent component analysis (ICA), which is a statistical technique commonly used in information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.ST). The paper also mentions the use of a Matlab package, which suggests a focus on practical implementation and software development (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
