This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG the most likely category.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper deals with generating and controlling human motion, which is a visual task. Additionally, the authors mention using motion capture data, which is a common technique in computer vision. Hence, cs.CV is a likely category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves developing a model that can generate an infinite number of naturally looking motions with infinite lengths, which is a task that requires artificial intelligence. Hence, cs.AI is a likely category.\n4. cs.GR (Graphics): The paper deals with generating and controlling human motion, which is a common task in computer graphics. Additionally, the authors mention embedding contact information into the generative deep learning model, which is a technique used in computer graphics. Hence, cs.GR is a likely category.\n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The paper deals with controlling human motion, which is a task that is relevant to robotics. Additionally, the authors mention exploring a variety of applications, ranging from random motion synthesis to motion filtering, which are tasks that are relevant to robotics.
