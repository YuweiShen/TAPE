The goal is to classify the emotional state of the human based on their walking style. This falls under the domain of computer vision and hence, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper deals with identifying emotions from walking styles, which is a part of human behavior. The proposed algorithm can be used in various applications such as human-robot interaction, surveillance, and healthcare. Hence, cs.HC is the second most likely sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses deep features learned via LSTM on labeled emotion datasets and combines them with affective features computed from gaits using posture and movement cues. These features are classified using a Random Forest Classifier. Hence, cs.LG is the third most likely sub-category.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with analyzing videos of individuals walking and extracting their walking gait in the form of 3D poses. The proposed algorithm can be used in various multimedia applications such as video analysis, surveillance, and entertainment. Hence, cs.MM is the fourth most likely sub-category.\n5. cs.RO (Robotics): The proposed algorithm can be used in various robotics applications such"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
