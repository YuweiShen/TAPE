This problem is a fundamental problem in machine learning and can be formulated as an $\\ell_1$ regularized maximum likelihood estimation. The paper also discusses the challenges of learning algorithms directly based on data and proposes a solution using an Alternating Minimization (AM) algorithm as the model inductive bias. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)\n- cs.IT (Information Theory)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
