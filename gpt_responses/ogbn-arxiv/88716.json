It specifically focuses on the analysis of educational data and student interactions in a continuous manner to identify behavioral patterns that lead to low scoring and possible dropout. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Cybernetics (cs.CY), Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Computation and Language (cs.CL), Social and Information Networks (cs.SOC), and Machine Learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
