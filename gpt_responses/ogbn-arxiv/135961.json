The use of codes and generator matrices suggests a connection to coding theory (cs.CC). The mention of closed chains of codes and explicit expressions for minimum distances suggests a connection to discrete structures (cs.DS). Finally, the focus on bounds and connections between different constructions suggests a connection to algorithms and complexity (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
