The proposed algorithms are based on machine learning techniques such as linear programming and maximum likelihood, which are commonly used in the subfields of machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the application of the proposed framework to dynamic decision-making settings, which is relevant to the subfield of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents a simulation of a driving game, which falls under the subfield of cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
