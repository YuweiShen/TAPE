This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the labelling algorithm for epistemic and strategy logic modalities, which is related to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-categories.
