The focus is on networks with piece-wise linear activation functions, which is a specific aspect of neural networks that falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE). The approach also involves the use of a specialized verification algorithm and search process, which can be seen as a form of control theory or system analysis (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
