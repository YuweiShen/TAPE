The use of linear programming hierarchies such as Sherali-Adams and Lovasz-Schrijver is a common technique in approximation algorithms, which suggests that cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) are likely categories. The paper also involves graph theory and combinatorics, which are relevant to cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory). Finally, the paper discusses subexponential-time algorithms, which are relevant to cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
