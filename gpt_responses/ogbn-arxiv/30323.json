This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also discusses the use of additional information (features) to counteract the decline in performance with increasing gallery size, which relates to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the use of ROC-based measures such as equal error rate (EER), which falls under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
