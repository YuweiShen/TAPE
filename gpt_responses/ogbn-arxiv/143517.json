It specifically focuses on handling constraints on strings and floats, which suggests a connection to programming languages (cs.PL) and formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). The paper also discusses the construction of a small, finite theory to extend the power of a solver, which could be related to logic in computer science (cs.LO). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on real-world benchmarks, which could be relevant to computer security and cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
