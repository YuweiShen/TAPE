The paper proposes a new distributional assumption that leads to polynomial-time algorithms for networks of ReLUs, even with one hidden layer. This makes the paper highly relevant to the sub-category of cs.LG (Machine Learning), which is the most likely category. The paper also deals with the problem of eigenvalue decay of the Gram matrix, which is a topic in numerical linear algebra, making it relevant to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the problem, making it relevant to the sub-category of cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also uses techniques from optimization and statistics, making it relevant to the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implications of the results, making it relevant to the sub-category of cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
