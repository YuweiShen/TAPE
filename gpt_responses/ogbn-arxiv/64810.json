The proposed approach uses local metric volumes connected by relative pose estimates, which is a technique commonly used in robotics and falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO). The paper also mentions the use of computer vision techniques for frontier-based exploration, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The approach also involves using machine learning techniques for exploration, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of system identification techniques for state estimation, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approach using statistical analysis, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
