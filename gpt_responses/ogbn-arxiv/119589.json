The method involves converting an image into a Stochastic Flow Graph and performing Markov Clustering on this graph. This involves the use of computer vision techniques (cs.CV) and machine learning algorithms (cs.AI) for object detection. The paper also discusses the use of deep learning techniques for feature extraction and classification, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of natural language processing techniques for text recognition, which falls under the category of computational linguistics (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
