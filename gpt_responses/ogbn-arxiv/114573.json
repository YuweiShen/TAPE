The proposed approach also involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) methods to predict objects in a vector representation directly. Finally, the paper also discusses the potential applications of the proposed method in robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
