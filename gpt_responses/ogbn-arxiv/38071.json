It may also belong to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category as it ingests data from various sources including social media. Information Retrieval (cs.IR) is another likely sub-category as the system processes a large amount of unstructured data to generate alerts. Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) could also be a possible sub-category as the system may use NLP techniques to analyze text data. Finally, Cybersecurity (cs.CY) could be a potential sub-category as the paper mentions ethical considerations in operating such a system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
