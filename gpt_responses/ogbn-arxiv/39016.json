The paper proposes an end-to-end model that learns regrasping policies from raw visuo-tactile data, which involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The model also involves action selection, which is related to control systems (cs.SY). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.RO, cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.SY."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
