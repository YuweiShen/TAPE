The paper also discusses the use of loss functions and the trade-off between matchability and geometric accuracy, which are common topics in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions wide baseline stereo, which is a topic in robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper discusses image retrieval, which is a topic in multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
