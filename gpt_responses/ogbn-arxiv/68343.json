The paper also mentions practical applications in wireless communication systems and wireless sensor networks, which are areas of research in systems and control (cs.SY). The use of the reduced-rank method and singular value decomposition (SVD) also suggests that the paper may fall under numerical analysis (cs.NA) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper discusses the ordering mechanism for singular vectors, which is a topic related to linear algebra and optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
