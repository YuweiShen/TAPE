The paper proposes an end-to-end learning system that uses unpaired fog and fogfree training images, adversarial discriminators and cycle consistency losses to automatically construct a fog removal system, which involves the use of machine learning techniques (cs.LG). The paper also makes explicit use of prior knowledge in the networks by embedding the atmospheric degradation principle and a sky prior for mapping fogfree images to the fog images domain, which involves the use of graphics (cs.GR). The paper also contributes the first real world nature fog-fogfree image dataset for defogging research, which involves the use of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper uses a learning-based approach, which involves the use of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
