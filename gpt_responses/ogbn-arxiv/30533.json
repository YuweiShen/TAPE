The focus on regulatory networks and signal processing suggests a connection to systems and control theory (cs.SI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also provides a tight upper bound on a central parameter of Boolean networks, which could be of interest to researchers in computational complexity (cs.CC) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
