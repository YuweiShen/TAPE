The algorithm proposed is decentralized and uses model predictive control, which involves control theory and system dynamics (cs.SY). The use of optimal control and non-linear programming also suggests a connection to mathematical optimization (cs.MA). The algorithm also involves predicting trajectories and collision avoidance, which are common topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper mentions using least squares, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
