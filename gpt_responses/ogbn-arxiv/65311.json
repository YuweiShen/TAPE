This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Cryptography and Security (cs.CR), or Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper focuses on the construction of these codes using algebraic geometry, which could place it in the Symbolic Computation and Algebraic Manipulation (cs.SD) or Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
