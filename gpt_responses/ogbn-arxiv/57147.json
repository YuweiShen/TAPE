This falls under the scope of several CS sub-categories, including cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). However, given the focus on algorithmic complexity and analysis, cs.SC and cs.DS are the most likely sub-categories. The mention of Gaussian elimination and matrix row reduction also suggests a connection to numerical linear algebra, which is relevant to cs.SY. Finally, the use of exponential growth in the number of variables suggests a connection to computational complexity theory, which is relevant to cs.LO."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
