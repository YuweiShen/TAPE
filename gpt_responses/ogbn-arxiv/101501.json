The paper also involves analyzing the performance of these codes through simulations, which could fall under the computational complexity (cs.CC) sub-category. Additionally, the paper may involve network communication and protocols, which could fall under the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The paper also involves modeling and approximations, which could fall under the social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-category.
