Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also leverages pre-trained language models, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (AI) research, suggesting cs.AI as the second likely sub-category. The use of neural networks and statistical models in the paper also makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) a likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper proposes a solution to the morphological richness problem of languages, which is a common challenge in NLP and could be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper mentions pre-processing and post-processing approaches, which could involve computer vision (cs.CV) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
