The study of shortest paths and polygonal paths falls under computational geometry (cs.CG). The use of control theory techniques suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY). The study of discrete analogues and limiting cases suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DS). Finally, the study of polygonal paths suggests a connection to computational topology (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
