The paper also focuses on cross-lingual document retrieval (CLDR), which is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and falls under the sub-category of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). The use of regularization and term-weighting schemes suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed methods on eight CLDR problems, which may involve the use of image-based retrieval techniques, making the paper relevant to the sub-category of Computer Vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
