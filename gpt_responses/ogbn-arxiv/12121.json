These are both subfields of computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SP). The paper also discusses the design of code patterns, which involves optimization techniques and linear algebra, making it relevant to information theory (cs.IT). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of machine learning techniques, which falls under the subfield of multimedia (cs.MM) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
