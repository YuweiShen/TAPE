The paper proposes a novel algorithm for lifelong learning that explicitly minimizes a proxy for the intra-task small-sample generalization error. Given the focus on machine learning, lifelong learning, and representation learning, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
