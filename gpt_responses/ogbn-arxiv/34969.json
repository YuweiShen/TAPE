The use of reflexive graph categories and the development of new models suggest a connection to category theory (cs.CT) and logic (cs.LO). The focus on System F and the use of type theory suggest a connection to programming languages (cs.PL) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the discussion of abstract properties and prescriptive suggestions for new models suggest a connection to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
