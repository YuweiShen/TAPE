The paper proposes a new method for eliminating spurious results in XML keyword search by exploiting the concept of structural consistency. This involves examining the global structure of the query results to ensure that all spurious results are consistently eliminated. This paper is likely to be classified under cs.DB (database systems), cs.IR (information retrieval), cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), cs.AI (artificial intelligence), and cs.SE (software engineering) because it involves techniques from these areas to solve the problem of keyword search in XML data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
