Additionally, the use of full-duplex MIMO transceivers and the consideration of different message configurations suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category. The optimization of antenna configurations and the use of beamforming techniques further suggest that the paper may be relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category. The use of MIMO technology and the consideration of different message types also suggest that the paper may be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the construction of achievable schemes for the different message configurations suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the computer communications (cs.COM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
