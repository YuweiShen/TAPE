The paper also introduces new techniques for handling local and global deformations, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper presents results on the ImageNet dataset and Pascal VOC 2007 benchmark, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
