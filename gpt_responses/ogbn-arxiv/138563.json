It also involves logical reasoning and inference (cs.LO) as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) since datalog is a declarative programming language used for knowledge representation and reasoning. The paper also discusses algorithms for efficient updates and maintenance (cs.DS) and the use of rewriting to optimise the materialisation process (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
