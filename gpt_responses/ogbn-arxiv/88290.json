The use of eye-movement patterns of human readers to extract cognitive features is related to the field of human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also involves statistical classification, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the use of cognitive features to improve the performance of sarcasm detection can be seen as an application of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper's focus on NLP applications such as sentiment analysis and dialog systems suggests that it could also be classified under the sub-category of cybernetics (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
