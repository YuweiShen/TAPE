The use of reachability maps and generalized Voronoi diagrams suggests a focus on computer vision (cs.CV) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also proposes a new sampling method, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves learning from data to improve the planning process."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
