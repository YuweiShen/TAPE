The algorithm is designed for use in general video game AI and can be used without heuristics. The approach is to extend recent work on rolling horizon evolutionary planning, which has been shown to work well for single-player games, to two (or in principle many) player games. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.GT (Game Theory). Additionally, the paper involves co-evolving two (or in the general case N) populations, one for each player, where each individual is a sequence of actions for the respective player. This suggests that the paper may also belong to cs.LG (Learning) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the paper involves evaluating the fitness of each individual by playing it against a selection of action-sequences from the opposing population, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
