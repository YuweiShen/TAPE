The paper also discusses applications in spectral clustering (cs.SI) and sparse PCA (cs.CV), which are subfields of machine learning and computer vision, respectively. The paper's focus on optimization and eigenproblems suggests that it could also be relevant to numerical analysis (cs.NA) and data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
