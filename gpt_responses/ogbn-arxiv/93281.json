This involves the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for learning the descriptor and a Siamese network for matching the descriptors. The paper also presents a method for estimating local surface patches and obtaining ground-truth correspondences. Given these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is Robotics (cs.RO), followed by Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Computation and Language (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
