The paper also discusses the use of stronger training and modeling power, which suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper introduces a modulation mechanism, which could be related to the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on the COCO benchmark, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
