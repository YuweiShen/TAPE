The paper proposes a new framework, the Tie-Breaking Label Search (TBLS), which unifies existing formalisms and allows for the derivation of new pattern-conditions for many usual searches. This work is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including data structures (cs.DS), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
