The paper also discusses the optimal rates for improper logistic regression with general function classes, which falls under the category of information theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.ST (Statistics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
