The paper also formulates the problem as a convex optimization problem, which is a common technique in information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.MA). Finally, the paper discusses the use of the Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound (CRB) as a performance constraint, which is a statistical measure commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
