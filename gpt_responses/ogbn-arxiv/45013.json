The paper specifically focuses on the application of these techniques in digital health, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of multi-omics data, which is a subfield of quantitative biology (q-bio.QM) and systems biology (q-bio.TO).
