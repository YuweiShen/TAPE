Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses the use of deep learning for feature reduction, which suggests that it could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, since the paper deals with security, it could also belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Finally, since the system is implemented as a network application on top of an SDN controller, it could also fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
