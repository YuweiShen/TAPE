The algorithm uses image processing techniques to extract features from the characters and then trains a neural network to recognize them. This work involves computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE) techniques. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of clustering algorithms to group similar characters together, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
