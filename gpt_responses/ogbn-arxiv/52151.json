Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) is a likely category. The paper also involves graph theory and combinatorics, which suggests cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as possible categories. The paper mentions feedback vertex set and cycle packing, which are topics in graph theory and optimization, respectively, indicating cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) as a possible category. Finally, the paper discusses the running time of the algorithms, which is a topic in complexity theory, suggesting cs.CC (Computational Complexity) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
