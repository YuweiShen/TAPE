The article also mentions the complexity of these problems, which is a topic of interest in computational complexity theory (cs.CC). Additionally, the use of algebraic techniques suggests a connection to algebraic structures and theories, which are studied in the field of mathematical logic (cs.LO) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
