This problem is common in natural language processing tasks, which are typically categorized under cs.CL. The proposed method involves introducing a cost-weighted term into the training loss, which is a technique commonly used in machine learning for regularization (cs.LG). The paper also proposes two estimators for measuring label confusion, which involves statistical analysis (cs.AI) and could potentially be applied to other classification tasks. Finally, the experiments involve using different models and datasets, which could fall under cs.IR (information retrieval) or cs.CV (computer vision) depending on the specific techniques used."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
