Information theory deals with the fundamental limits of communication and coding, which is relevant to the proposed STBC design. \n2. cs.SI (Signal Processing) - The paper discusses encoding and decoding techniques for STBC, which is a signal processing problem. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - STBC is used in wireless communication systems, which is a networking problem. \n4. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) - The paper discusses the decoding complexity of the proposed STBC, which is a computational problem. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - STBC is used in multimedia communication systems, which is relevant to this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
