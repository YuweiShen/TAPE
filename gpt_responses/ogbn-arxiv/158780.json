This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG the most likely category.\n2. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): ICA is a popular technique used in neural networks, and the paper proposes a new method for ICA. Hence, cs.NE is also a likely category.\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the computation of correlation coefficients for normally weighted data, which is a topic related to information theory.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): ICA has applications in social and information networks, and the paper proposes a new method for ICA. Hence, cs.SI is also a possible category.\n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): ICA is a technique used in artificial intelligence, and the paper proposes a new method for ICA.
