The paper proposes a model that identifies groups of nodes with similar link patterns, which are called network roles, and uses a maximum margin classifier to learn the mapping from network roles to class labels. The paper also presents an iterative margin-based active learning strategy to choose a subset of nodes to label. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SD (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.DS (Databases), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
