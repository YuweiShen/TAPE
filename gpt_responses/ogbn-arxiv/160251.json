The use of probability and convergence also suggests that it could belong to information theory (cs.IT) and statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the application of the results to the planted model suggests that it could also belong to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
