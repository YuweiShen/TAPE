The problem involves the use of algorithms to ensure that the robots move without colliding, which is a topic in distributed computing (cs.DC) and distributed systems (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of external visible lights on the robots, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
