Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also discusses security guarantees, which suggests that it could belong to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Additionally, the paper discusses performance, which could place it in cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper proposes a concrete technique, which could place it in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
