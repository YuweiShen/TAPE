The authors also propose a method for inferring the network topology, which is relevant to the security of the network.\n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper provides a measurement study of the Zcash network, including metrics such as network size and node distribution. The authors also propose a method for inferring the network topology, which is relevant to the networking and internet architecture domain.\n\n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper discusses the peer-to-peer network of Zcash, which is a distributed system. The authors also propose a method for inferring the network topology, which is relevant to the distributed computing domain.\n\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses the privacy and anonymity aspects of Zcash, which have implications for society. The authors also propose a method for inferring the network topology, which is relevant to the societal impact of cryptocurrencies.\n\n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper discusses the network topology of Zcash and proposes a method for inferring it.
