The paper also discusses the characteristics of learned deep CNN representations, which is a topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper uses grating stimuli to study the frequency and orientation tuning of channels in trained object detection deep CNNs, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper links basic human visual perception models to the characteristics of deep CNN representations, which is a topic in human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
