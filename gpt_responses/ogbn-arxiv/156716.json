This falls under the scope of information retrieval, which involves organizing and analyzing large amounts of textual data.\n\n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - Latent Dirichlet allocation is a machine learning technique used for topic modeling. The paper also discusses the use of empirical evidence to evaluate the impact of different types of financial disclosures on stock prices, which can be considered a form of machine learning.\n\n3. cs.CL (Computation and Language) - The paper deals with the analysis of textual data, which falls under the scope of computation and language. The use of natural language processing techniques to categorize the content of regulatory filings is also discussed.\n\n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper discusses the implications of its findings for managers, investors, and policy-makers, which falls under the scope of computers and society.
