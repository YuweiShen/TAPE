This work involves computer vision (CV) techniques such as object detection and image classification, which are typically covered in the cs.CV sub-category. Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of machine learning (ML) techniques such as contrastive training, which falls under the cs.AI sub-category. The proposed method also involves the use of deep learning (DL) techniques such as neural networks, which are typically covered in the cs.LG sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques such as suppression of false detection in the background, which falls under the cs.RO sub-category. Finally, the paper also discusses the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as high-quality annotations, which are typically covered in the cs.CL sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
