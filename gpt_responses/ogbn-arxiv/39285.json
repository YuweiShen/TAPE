This falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS) and information retrieval (cs.IR). The paper also mentions the use of support data structures, which is a common topic in algorithms and data structures (cs.AL). The external memory aspect of the algorithm suggests that it may also fall under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper mentions the computation of succinct LCP arrays for circular strings, which could fall under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
