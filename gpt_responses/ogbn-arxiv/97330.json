The paper proposes a novel approach based on minimum uncertainty metrics and Bayesian neural networks, which are techniques commonly used in the sub-fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The approach is tested on image classification tasks, which is a common application of deep neural networks in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the limitations of existing adversarial detection methods, which is a topic in the sub-field of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a convex optimization problem for determining the sampling probabilities, which is a technique commonly used in the sub-field of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
