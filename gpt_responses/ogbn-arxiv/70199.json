The scheme uses permutation-substitution operations, which involves manipulating the pixels of an image, and thus could also fall under the categories of image processing (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM). The use of Lucas series suggests a possible connection to information theory (cs.IT), while the focus on security weaknesses and attacks could also relate to the sub-category of security and privacy (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
