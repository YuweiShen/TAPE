It also uses the Delsarte theorem, which is a tool commonly used in coding theory and combinatorics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the bounds on the size of codes, which is a topic in cryptography (cs.CR) and error-correcting codes (cs.CC). Finally, the paper's construction has potential applications in signal processing and communication systems (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
