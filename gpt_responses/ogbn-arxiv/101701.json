The scheduling problem is critical and practical in distributed computing networks. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper considers real-time jobs with a strict job deadline, where each job is a collection of tasks of some types specified by the application. The scheduling algorithm is needed to maximize the average number of completed jobs for each application. \n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with a distributed computing network consisting of a master and multiple workers processing tasks of different types. \n4. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper develops two scheduling algorithms, namely, a feasibility-optimal scheduling algorithm and an approximate scheduling algorithm. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The scheduling problem is critical and practical in distributed computing networks, and the paper proposes an approximate scheduling algorithm with a guaranteed approximation ratio in the worst-case scenario."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
