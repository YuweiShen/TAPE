The proposed technique, Product Quantization, is a widely used method in multimedia search systems, which falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM) and database (cs.DB) systems. The paper also discusses the use of quantizers, which are commonly used in data structures (cs.DS) for nearest neighbor search. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.CV and cs.IR, followed by cs.MM, cs.DB, and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
