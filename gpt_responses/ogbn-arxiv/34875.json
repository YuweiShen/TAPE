This topic falls under the area of network function virtualization (NFV) and network infrastructure (NI), making cs.NI the most likely sub-category. The paper also considers the latency requirements of SFCs, which falls under the area of systems and control (SY), making cs.SY another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the consolidation of VNFs to reduce capital expenditures, which relates to the area of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (DC), making cs.DC another possible sub-category.
