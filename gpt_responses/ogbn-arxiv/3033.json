The paper also focuses on the use of Continuous Experimentation (CE) in cyber-physical systems, specifically in the automotive domain, which falls under the robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and embedded systems (cs.EM) categories. Finally, the paper discusses the challenges of adopting CE in self-driving vehicles, which may require human-computer interaction (cs.HC) considerations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
