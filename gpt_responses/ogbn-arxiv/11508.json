Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of global parameters sharing and smaller windows in the text to address practical problems, which are related to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed model's performance on several datasets, which is a common practice in the machine learning and data mining (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR) fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
