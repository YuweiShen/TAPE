Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves the use of algorithms and computational methods, which could place it in cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also discusses the potential applications of the proposed method in digital communication systems, which could place it in cs.SI (Signal Processing) or cs.CC (Computational Complexity)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
