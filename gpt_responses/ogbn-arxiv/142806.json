The paper also discusses lifelong learning, which is a topic in machine learning, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a likely sub-category as well. Additionally, the paper evaluates state-of-the-art algorithms, which suggests that it may also belong to the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category.
