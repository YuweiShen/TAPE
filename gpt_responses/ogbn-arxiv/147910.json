The paper focuses on the spectral efficiency and interference cancellation, which are key topics in the field of network information theory (cs.IT) and network optimization (cs.SY). The use of multi-antenna BSs/UEs also suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM) as MIMO technology is often used in multimedia applications. Finally, the paper provides design guidelines for the practical implementation of FD technology in large small-cell networks, which falls under the sub-category of computer networks and communications (cs.COM). Overall, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (networking and internet architecture) as the paper deals with the performance analysis of wireless networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
