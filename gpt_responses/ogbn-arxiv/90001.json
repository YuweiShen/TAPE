The paper also discusses the performance of the network in image classification tasks (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper proposes a new method for approximating the tangent subspace, which is a common technique in optimization algorithms (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
