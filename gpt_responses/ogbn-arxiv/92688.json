Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves networked systems and communication protocols, which could fall under cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). The use of quantize-map-and-forward and the development of new outer bounds suggest a focus on signal processing and machine learning, which could place the paper in cs.MM (Multimedia) or cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
