The paper introduces a framework for investigating tractability beyond traditional settings, which involves the representation of query results as a nested structure that is polynomial in size. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to several sub-categories, including databases (cs.DB), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), machine learning (cs.LG), computational complexity (cs.CC), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
