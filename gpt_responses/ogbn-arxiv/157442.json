It also involves deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of PDEs and optimization techniques suggests that it may also belong to the Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. Additionally, the incorporation of symmetries in the design of the network suggests that it may belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of group theory and equivariance suggests that it may also belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
