The use of autoencoders and graph convolutional networks suggests that the paper may belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) or computer graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. The focus on non-rigid deformations and the use of a novel embedded deformation layer suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the multiple applications of the proposed method, including 3D reconstruction and surface tracking, suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
