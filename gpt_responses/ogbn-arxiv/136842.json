This involves abstractly expressing the formula as a multiway tree model, mapping derivation steps as reusable formula templates, and using Q-learning in a feature space of formulas to achieve derivation. This work involves machine learning, artificial intelligence, and algorithm development, which are all relevant to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SY (Systems and Control), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
