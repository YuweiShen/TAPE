The paper presents algorithms for minimizing the storage footprint and reallocation costs, which are relevant to several subfields of computer science. Specifically, the paper deals with data structures (cs.DS), databases (cs.DB), algorithms (cs.AL), distributed computing (cs.DC), and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
