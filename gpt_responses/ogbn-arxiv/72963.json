The use of physical characteristics of sensors suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR). The comparison of different fusion techniques using various metrics suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
