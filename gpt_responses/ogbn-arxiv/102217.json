Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Additionally, the paper mentions the prerequisite needed for computing maximum s,t-flow in directed planar graphs, which falls under the sub-categories cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
