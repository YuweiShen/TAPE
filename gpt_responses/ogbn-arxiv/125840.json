The paper also discusses the joint performance of multiple systems, which falls under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI). The use of beamforming vectors and covariance matrices is related to multimedia systems (cs.MM), and the discussion of Pareto optimality is related to game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
