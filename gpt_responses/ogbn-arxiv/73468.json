The paper also discusses the trade-off between performance and implementation overhead, which is a common concern in distributed computing (cs.DC). The use of stochastic methods and analysis is also a prominent feature of the paper, which suggests that it may also belong to the categories of systems and control (cs.SY), probability (cs.PF), and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
