The presence of an eavesdropper and the need for privacy also suggest a focus on cryptography (cs.CR). The use of erasure channels and the study of capacity also suggest a focus on coding theory (cs.CC) and communication engineering (cs.CE). Finally, the mention of previous work on the topic suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM) if the OT protocol is used for secure multimedia transmission."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
