Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems, and this paper can be seen as a contribution to this field. \n- cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper proposes a local searching algorithm to improve the accuracy of DOA and array manifold estimation. Signal processing techniques are often used to extract information from signals, and this paper can be seen as a signal processing approach to the problem of DOA and array manifold estimation. \n- cs.SP (Speech Processing): Although the paper does not explicitly deal with speech processing, the techniques used in the paper can be applied to speech processing applications, such as speaker localization and speech enhancement. \n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper can be seen as a contribution to the field of multimedia, as it deals with the estimation of parameters in a MIMO array system, which is often used in multimedia applications such as video and audio transmission. \n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper can be relevant to the field of networking and internet architecture, as it deals with the estimation of parameters in wireless communication systems, which are often used in networking and internet applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
