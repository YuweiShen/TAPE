This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves simulations based on experimental measurements, which suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) or Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories.
