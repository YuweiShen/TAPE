The paper also introduces a novel notion of defense graphs, which can be seen as a type of graph theory, falling under the category of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses how the notion of defense equivalence can be used in argumentation summarization, which can be seen as a natural language processing (cs.CL) and cryptography (cs.CR) problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
