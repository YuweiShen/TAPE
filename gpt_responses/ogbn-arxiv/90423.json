Therefore, cs.IR and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses different fusion strategies, which are commonly used in deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models, making cs.DL a likely sub-category as well. The tasks of expert finding and blog distillation involve analyzing text data, which falls under the scope of cs.SI. Finally, the paper deals with data retrieval and storage, which is relevant to cs.DB."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
