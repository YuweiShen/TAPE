The use of convex optimization for reconstruction suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the impact of measurement noise, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper's results apply to both high bit-depth and coarse quantizers, which suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
