The paper also discusses the need for further work to make these systems work equally well for people across different countries and income levels, which could be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the qualitative analyses mentioned in the paper suggest that appearance differences and context play a role in the drop in performance, which could be relevant to the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the dataset used in the study, which could be relevant to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
