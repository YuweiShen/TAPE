The paper also proposes a new learning method called \"transparent boosting tree\" that visualizes the learning process of gradient boosting tree, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper applies the proposed method to two datasets, indicating a potential application in data management (cs.DB) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
