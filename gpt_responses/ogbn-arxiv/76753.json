The use of style transfer for data augmentation also involves machine learning techniques, which could place it under the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the effectiveness of the classifiers on different datasets, which could fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
