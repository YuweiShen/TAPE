This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and specifically involves computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) techniques. The use of group lasso regularization also suggests a potential connection to neural networks (cs.NE) and natural language processing (cs.CL) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
