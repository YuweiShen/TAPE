The paper also mentions the comparison with CDMA, which is a technique used in network communication (cs.NI). The paper discusses the protection against jamming, which is a security concern and falls under the domain of cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also mentions the inherent method of synchronization, which is a control system aspect (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses transmitted energy efficiency, which is a signal processing aspect (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
