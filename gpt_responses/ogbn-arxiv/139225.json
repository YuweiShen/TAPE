The paper also mentions the flatness of the mechanical connection associated with the robotic system, which is a topic in geometric mechanics (cs.DS). Additionally, the paper deals with rigid body kinematics and multibody dynamics, which are subfields of mechanical engineering (cs.ME) and robotics (cs.ROB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
