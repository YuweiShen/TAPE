The proposed method is applied to image classification tasks, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The method involves partitioning the space of sequences of neuron activations, which is a technique used in neural network analysis (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the use of interpretable models such as logistic regression and decision trees, which is a topic in natural language processing and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
