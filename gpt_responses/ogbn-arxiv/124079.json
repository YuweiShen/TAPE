The optimization is driven by physics simulations, which suggests the paper could belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) or Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. However, the use of a neural network for optimization and the focus on metasurfaces suggest the paper could also belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) or Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also involves machine learning techniques, which could place it in the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
