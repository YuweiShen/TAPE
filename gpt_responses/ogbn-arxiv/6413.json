The paper specifically focuses on the problem of rejecting non-aircraft artefacts, which is a common challenge in computer vision applications and falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV). The proposed technique involves machine learning algorithms, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the proposed system involves statistical analysis, which is a common technique in machine learning and falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with the application of the proposed technique in the context of UAV operations, which falls under the category of graphics (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
