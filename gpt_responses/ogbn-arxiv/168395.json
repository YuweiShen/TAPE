The paper also discusses the weight distribution of the codes, which is a topic in coding theory (cs.CC). The construction of the codes involves solving systems of linear equations, which is a topic in numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper presents some applications of the codes, which could fall under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
