It also proposes a recursive search algorithm that minimizes the total communication cost, which is a common problem in distributed computing. \n\nThe paper is also likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it focuses on training very large CNN and RNN models. \n\nComputer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) is another likely sub-category as CNN models are commonly used in computer vision tasks. \n\nArtificial Intelligence (cs.AI) is also a possible sub-category as DNN models are a popular tool in AI research. \n\nFinally, Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) is a possible sub-category as the paper deals with optimizing the training of neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
