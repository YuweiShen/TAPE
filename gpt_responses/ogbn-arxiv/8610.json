The methodology is implemented in a system that uses logical decision tree representation (cs.CL) and is tested in both propositional and relational domains (cs.DB). The use of decision trees also suggests a connection to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
