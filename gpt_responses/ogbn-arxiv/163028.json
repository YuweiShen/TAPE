The use of symmetry to design these schedules is a novel approach and could potentially fall under the category of computational geometry (cs.CG) or computer algebra (cs.SC). The focus on the classical matrix multiplication algorithm suggests that the paper could also fall under the categories of numerical analysis (cs.NA) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
