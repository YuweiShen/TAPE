The proposed technique involves regularization and policy learning, which are also relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of visual sensors and the simulation of a racing car game suggest that computer vision (cs.CV) may also be relevant. Finally, the focus on robustness and failure modes suggests that the paper may also be relevant to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
