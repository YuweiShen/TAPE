It also mentions the use of regularizers, which is a common technique in machine learning. Additionally, the paper could also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category as it deals with learning new metrics. The use of metrics is also relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories, which could make this paper relevant to those fields as well. Finally, the paper could also be relevant to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category as it proposes a new method for representing and learning metrics on categorical data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
