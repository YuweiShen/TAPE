The paper specifically focuses on functional logic programming, which is a subfield of Programming Languages. The paper also discusses the deduction of negative information from programs, which is related to the sub-category of Software Engineering (cs.SE). Additionally, the paper presents a proof calculus, which is a formal system for reasoning about proofs, and is related to the sub-category of Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL). Finally, the paper discusses the finite failure of reduction within CRWL, which is related to the sub-category of Symbolic Computation (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
