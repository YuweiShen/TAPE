The use of nonmonotonic logic programs and answer set programming suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). The need to access external sources and process heterogeneous data formats suggests a connection to databases (cs.DB) and programming languages (cs.PL). Finally, the focus on efficient evaluation and scalability suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
