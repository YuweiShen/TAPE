Information theory concepts such as SINR and INR are used in the optimization problems. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the coexistence of radar and cellular communication systems, which is a networking problem. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed approach involves optimizing the transmit power of the BS while ensuring the receive SINR level of downlink users and the INR level to radar, which can be seen as a control problem. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the interference between radar and cellular communication systems, which can affect the quality of multimedia transmission. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Although not the main focus of the paper, the interference between radar and cellular communication systems can potentially pose security risks, making this category a possibility."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
