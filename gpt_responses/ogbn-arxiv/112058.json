The mention of \"Boolean domains\" and \"Schaefer's original dichotomy for SAT variants\" suggests that the paper is focused on computational complexity theory (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The mention of \"algebraic approach\" suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and logic in computer science (cs.LO). Finally, the mention of \"templates on non-Boolean domains\" suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
