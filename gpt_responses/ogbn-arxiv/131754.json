This falls under the scope of multimedia analysis and retrieval (cs.MM) as well as information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of visual descriptors based on pixel images (SURF and Visual Bag of Words) and automated scene description using Convolutional Neural Networks suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as another likely sub-category. The text-based descriptor (Word2vec) obtained from processing the captions provided by the users indicates natural language processing (cs.CL) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the use of machine learning techniques for multi-label classification falls under the scope of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
