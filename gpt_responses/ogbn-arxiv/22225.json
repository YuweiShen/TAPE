The paper discusses the use of binary classifiers and the acquisition of measurements in a new modality at each stage. This work involves machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and data structures. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of classifiers in security applications, which falls under the category of cryptography and security. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.DS, and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
