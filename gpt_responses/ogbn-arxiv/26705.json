The paper also discusses the use of closed-loop prediction to handle complex dynamics, which is a topic in control systems (cs.SY). The paper proposes a new sampling-based algorithm, which involves optimization and search techniques, making it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper uses numerical simulations, which may involve computer vision techniques (cs.CV) to analyze the results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
