Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The method also involves probability maps and level set optimisation, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. Additionally, the paper focuses on medical imaging and specifically on patients with pulmonary hypertension, which suggests that it could also be relevant to the neural engineering (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
