The proposed system also involves hardware architecture and inter-device communication, which could be categorized under computer architecture (cs.AR) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed system on deep learning applications, which could be classified under computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
