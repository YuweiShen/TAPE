The paper proposes a technique for mitigating such attacks based on addition of noise to the parameter space of deep reinforcement learners during training. This technique is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), cryptography and security (cs.CR), computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV), and systems and control (cs.SY). Among these, cs.LG and cs.AI are the most likely sub-categories, as the paper deals with deep reinforcement learning and policy manipulation attacks, which are core topics in these fields. The other sub-categories are also relevant, as the paper discusses the impact of adversarial examples on deep Q networks and proposes a technique for mitigating such attacks, which is relevant to these sub-fields as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
