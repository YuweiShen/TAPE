This falls under the domain of information theory.\n2. cs.COMM (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a new waveform for 5G wireless communication systems and discusses techniques to reduce computational complexity. This is relevant to the field of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper does not directly relate to social networks, but the proposed techniques could potentially be applied to improve the efficiency of communication in social networks.\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): Similar to cs.COMM, the paper's focus on improving the efficiency of wireless communication systems makes it relevant to the field of networking and internet architecture.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper proposes novel transmitter and receiver structures that take advantage of the particular structure in the modulation matrix to reduce computational complexity. This falls under the domain of data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
