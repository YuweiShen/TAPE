The use of a mixture of regression experts and the inclusion of deformation constraints suggest that machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) may also be relevant sub-categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the performance of the algorithm on publicly available datasets, indicating that information retrieval (cs.IR) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
