However, it also addresses the issue of communication compression, which is relevant to distributed computing (cs.DC) and networking (cs.NI). The paper also involves the use of algorithms and optimization techniques (cs.DS) and discusses the convergence rate of the proposed method (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
