The paper specifically focuses on using pivot languages to improve translation performance for resource-scarce language pairs. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related topics. \n\nThe paper also proposes a joint training algorithm for the source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target translation models, which involves connecting and enabling them to interact with each other during training. This suggests that the paper may also belong to sub-categories related to machine learning and neural networks, such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). \n\nFinally, the paper uses Europarl and WMT corpora for experiments, which are commonly used in machine translation research. This suggests that the paper may also belong to sub-categories related to computer vision and image processing, such as cs.CV (Computer Vision), which often use similar datasets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
