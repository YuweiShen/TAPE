The proposed method involves transferring landmark annotations between different datasets, which can be seen as a form of transfer learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also presents experimental results on combining multiple datasets, which involves data fusion and potentially data mining techniques (cs.MM, cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
