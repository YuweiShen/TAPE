The specific focus on simultaneously structured models and the application to sparse and low-rank matrices suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the application of the framework to various measurement ensembles, which could fall under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
