The paper focuses on a polymorphic manifest contract calculus and techniques for reasoning about it, including program transformations related to static contract verification. This work is highly relevant to programming languages (cs.PL) and logic (cs.LO), as well as software engineering (cs.SE) and type systems (cs.TYPES). The paper also discusses subtyping relations, which are relevant to formal languages (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
