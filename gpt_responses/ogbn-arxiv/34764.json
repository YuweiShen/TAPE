The algorithmic innovations include a fast numerical optimization routine for Bayesian posterior inference and a statistically efficient scheme for decomposing astronomical optimization problems into subproblems. These innovations suggest that the paper could belong to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), distributed computing (cs.DC), and scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
