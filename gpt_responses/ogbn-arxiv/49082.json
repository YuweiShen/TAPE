This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG the most likely sub-category.\n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper uses a DCAE for learning compact feature spaces, which is commonly used in computer vision tasks. This makes cs.CV a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of RL algorithms for feature selection policies falls under the domain of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI a likely sub-category.\n4. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses a DCAE, which is a type of neural network, for learning compact feature spaces. This makes cs.NE a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper deals with efficiently learning feature selection policies on large unstructured data, which involves the use of algorithms.
