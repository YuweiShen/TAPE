The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and similarity search also suggests a possible fit with multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. The learning of a global descriptor through a CNN trained on reference images indicates a possible connection with machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
