The paper proposes a technique for improving the bit error rate (BER) performance of polar coding over channels with different reliability levels, which is a topic related to information theory (cs.IT) and communication systems (cs.NE). The paper also applies the framework of non-stationary polar codes to the crossbar array, which is a topic related to computer architecture (cs.AR) and emerging memory technologies (cs.EM). Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.ET, cs.AR, cs.IT, cs.EM, and cs.NE, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
