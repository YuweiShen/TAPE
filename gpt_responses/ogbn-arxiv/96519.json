Additionally, the paper proposes a method to improve the performance of CNNs by adding NAM, which involves machine learning (cs.AI), and optimization techniques (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the parameters of NAM, which falls under the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper may involve natural language processing (cs.CL) if the authors discuss the use of NAM for text-based tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
