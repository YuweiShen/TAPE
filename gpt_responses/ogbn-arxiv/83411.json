This involves exploring the state space and using a block-iterative variant of value iteration over the same partitions for the analysis of probabilistic reachability and expected-reward properties. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper involves the use of logic-based techniques for model checking, which is a key area of research in this sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with probabilistic models and decision-making, which are key areas of research in AI.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper involves the use of specialised algorithms for model checking, which is a key area of research in this sub-category.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper involves the implementation of the technique within a toolset, which is a key area of research in this sub-category.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper involves the development of a technique for model checking, which is a key area of research in software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
