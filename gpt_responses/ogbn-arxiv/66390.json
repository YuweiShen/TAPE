The use of the Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform suggests that the paper may belong to the cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) sub-category. The focus on approximation bounds and running time suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-categories.
