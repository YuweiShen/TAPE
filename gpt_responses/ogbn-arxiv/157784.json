The use of spatiotemporal data also suggests a potential connection to computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also proposes a new framework for modeling uncertainty, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning (cs.LG) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
