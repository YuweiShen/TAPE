The paper discusses the use of convolutional neural networks and the incorporation of human knowledge through linear constraints. These topics are commonly found in the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). However, given the focus on image classification and deep learning, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
