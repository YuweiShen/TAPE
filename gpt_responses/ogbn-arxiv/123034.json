The focus on designing computer systems that can recognize and process human emotions suggests a connection to Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). The use of emotionally annotated databases and ontologies for efficient data extraction and sorting suggests a connection to Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Semantic Web (cs.SI). Finally, the use of multimedia stimuli and the need for precise emotional annotation suggests a connection to Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
