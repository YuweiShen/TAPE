It also mentions the use of deep neural networks and the ImageNet and CIFAR100 datasets, which are commonly used in these sub-fields. Additionally, the paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI), natural language processing (cs.CL), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-categories, as it discusses the effectiveness of the proposed measure in predicting the performance and convergence speed of transfer and meta-transfer learning methods, even for small or imbalanced data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
