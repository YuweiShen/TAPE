This involves converting the features into a textual form and indexing them using Lucene, a popular information retrieval tool. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval). The paper also heavily relies on computer vision techniques, specifically deep learning and convolutional neural networks, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper deals with multimedia data and retrieval, which could place it in cs.MM (Multimedia). The use of deep learning techniques for feature extraction and indexing could also suggest cs.DL (Deep Learning) as a possible category. Finally, the paper deals with indexing and retrieval of large datasets, which could place it in cs.DB (Databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
