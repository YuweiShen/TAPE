The proposed solution involves using machine learning techniques such as convolutional LSTM encoder-decoder models, which falls under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also mentions the use of the proposed solution in aircraft and ground stations, which suggests a system-level approach, falling under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
