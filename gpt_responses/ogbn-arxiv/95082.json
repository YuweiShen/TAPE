This falls under the category of game theory (cs.GT) and requires efficient algorithms to construct menus for customers. The problem is also shown to be strongly NP-hard, which suggests that it involves computational complexity (cs.DS). The use of probabilistic scores and the need to optimize the number of matches suggests that the paper may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper deals with a two-sided market, which is a topic of interest in social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
