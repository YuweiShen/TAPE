This problem is related to topics in computational complexity (cs.CC), data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), graph theory (cs.GT), and algorithms (cs.AI). The use of subset query oracles is a common technique in these areas, and the paper builds upon previous work in this field."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
