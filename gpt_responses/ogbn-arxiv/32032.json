This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the modulation of data using the environment itself, which requires a deep understanding of communication channels and information theory. \n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) - The paper proposes the use of distinctive reflecting surfaces as patterns to be decoded by a receiver. This involves computer vision and pattern recognition techniques. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the use of light sources in our environments to monitor logistics and activities in cities and buildings, which involves multimedia data processing and analysis. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a new communication system that requires a deep understanding of the underlying system and control mechanisms involved in the modulation of light signals."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
