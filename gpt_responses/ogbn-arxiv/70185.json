This suggests a strong connection to the sub-category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), which deals with the study of online platforms and social networks. Additionally, the paper discusses the design of user interfaces and platform policies, which aligns with the sub-category of Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). The use of aggregate user feedback and the analysis of log data suggest a connection to Information Retrieval (cs.IR). The study of biases in online platforms also has implications for the sub-category of Social and Economic Networks (cs.SOC). Finally, the mention of detecting other forms of biases suggests a connection to the sub-category of Cybersecurity (cs.CYBER)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
