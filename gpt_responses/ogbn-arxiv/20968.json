This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) category. The proposed method also involves computer vision techniques for eye contact detection, which suggests that the paper could also belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of machine learning techniques, which could place it in the Multimedia (cs.MM) or Information Retrieval (cs.IR) categories. Finally, the paper discusses the calculation of attention metrics, which could involve natural language processing techniques and place it in the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
