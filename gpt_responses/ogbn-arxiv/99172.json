These are all topics that are commonly studied in the field of computer networks and communication systems, which falls under the category of cs.NI (Networks and Internet Architecture). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of software-defined radios (SDRs) and the development of Python modules, which are topics that are relevant to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper also mentions the optimization of spectrum utility, which is a topic that falls under cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the paper discusses the evaluation of the system under realistic channel and radio hardware effects, which is a topic that falls under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
