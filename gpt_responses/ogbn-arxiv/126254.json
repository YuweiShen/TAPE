The proposed receiver utilizes the FEC code information, which involves error correction techniques, and hence can also be categorized under the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category. The receiver is non-iterative, which implies that it does not involve any optimization or learning algorithms, and hence can be categorized under the non-iterative optimization (cs.NI) sub-category. Finally, the paper proposes a joint detection and decoding approach that provides improved reliability, which can be categorized under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
