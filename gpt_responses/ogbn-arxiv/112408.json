It also analyzes the convergence rate of the proposed method and provides theoretical insights for popular large-batch training techniques. Additionally, the experiments are conducted on ImageNet dataset, which is commonly used in computer vision research (cs.CV). The paper also involves optimization techniques (cs.NE) and deep learning (cs.AI) concepts. Finally, the paper deals with the analysis of gradient-based methods, which is related to the category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
