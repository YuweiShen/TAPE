This involves the optimization of the transmitted waveform and backhaul quantization for the compress-and-forward (CF) backhaul transmission strategy, and the amplifying gains of the sensors for the amplify-and-forward (AF) backhaul strategy. The paper also adopts an information-theoretic criterion for the detection performance. These aspects suggest that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories:\n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the optimization of communication strategies based on an information-theoretic criterion, which is the Bhattacharyya distance.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper deals with the joint optimization of sensing and communication functions in a multistatic cloud radar system, which can be seen as a control system.\n- cs.SP (Signal Processing): The paper deals with the processing of signals in a multistatic cloud radar system, including the optimization of the transmitted waveform and the amplifying gains of the sensors.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the design of backhaul communication strategies in a multistatic cloud radar system, which involves the communication between receive sensors and a fusion center.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the optimization of sensing and communication functions in a multistatic cloud radar system"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
