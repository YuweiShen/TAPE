The technique involves using sensors such as LiDAR and stereo cameras, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of Bayesian inference techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI, cs.LG). Finally, the paper addresses the issue of uncertainty in robot pose, which is a common problem in control systems and robotics (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
