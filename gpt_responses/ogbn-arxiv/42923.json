This involves designing schemes for user partitioning and joint detection and decoding. The paper is likely to be categorized under Information Theory (cs.IT) as it deals with channel coding and decoding techniques. It may also be categorized under Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) and Communications (cs.COMM) as it deals with wireless network transmission techniques. Additionally, it may be categorized under Systems and Control (cs.SY) as it involves designing a system for efficient transmission. Lastly, it may be categorized under Machine Learning (cs.LG) as it uses the concept of channel polarization for signal processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
