It also involves the use of loss functions and optimization techniques, which are common in machine learning research. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the focus is on improving the explainability of AI models. \n\nThe paper's use of the Integrated Gradient method for feature attribution suggests a connection to cs.CV (Computer Vision), where this method is commonly used for interpreting image classification models. \n\nThe paper's discussion of adversarial training and its impact on model sparsity and stability could also place it in the sub-categories of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), as adversarial attacks and defenses are important topics in these fields."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
