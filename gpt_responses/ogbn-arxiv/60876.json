This involves task allocation and collaboration among agents, which suggests relevance to robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed mechanism involves visual SLAM, which suggests relevance to computer vision (cs.CV). The use of deep Q networks (DQN) and reinforcement learning suggests relevance to machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the collaboration among agents involves interaction and coordination, which suggests relevance to systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
