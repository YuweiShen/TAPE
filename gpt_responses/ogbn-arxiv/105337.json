The proposed methods are based on machine learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (cs.LG) and sparse coding (cs.AI). The paper also involves mathematical concepts such as Euclidean distance matrix (cs.GR) and experiments on a dataset (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
