The proposed scheme and lower bound involve algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and system implementation (cs.SI). The topic of coded caching also falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC), which is closely related to computer networks and communication (cs.CC). However, since the focus of the paper is on the theoretical limits rather than practical implementation, cs.CC is less likely to be the primary category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
