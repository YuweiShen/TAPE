It also uses network analysis methods to study the structure of co-occurrence networks of words in texts. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) as it applies concepts and methods of complex networks to analyse texts. \n\ncs.LG (Machine Learning) is another likely sub-category as the paper uses four machine learning methods to verify the effectiveness of the features extracted from the network motifs. \n\ncs.IR (Information Retrieval) is also a possible sub-category as authorship attribution is a task related to document retrieval and classification. \n\nFinally, cs.CY (Cryptography and Security) could be a less likely sub-category as authorship attribution is sometimes used in forensic linguistics to identify anonymous authors of threatening or criminal messages."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
