Therefore, cs.CV and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel approach based on the encoder-decoder framework with the attention mechanism, which involves deep learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and attention models. Therefore, cs.LG and cs.AI are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves information retrieval (IR) techniques such as symbol recognition and structural analysis. Therefore, cs.IR is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
