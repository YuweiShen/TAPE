Therefore, cs.LG is a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The first level of the proposed model involves a convolutional neural network to extract the visual shape of a character, which is a computer vision technique. Hence, cs.CV is a possible sub-category.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The use of neural networks for learning word embeddings falls under the scope of artificial intelligence, making cs.AI a likely sub-category.\n5. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The evaluation of the proposed model involves tasks such as named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging, which are related to information retrieval.
