Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the fundamental limits of data communication and storage. The next likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), which deals with the design, implementation, and evaluation of computer networks and networked systems. The paper also involves sparsity-based techniques, which fall under the category of cs.SI (Signal Processing), and mmWave communication, which falls under cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper deals with the performance evaluation of a communication system, which falls under cs.COM (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
