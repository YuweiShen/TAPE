Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper proposes a novel Attribute-Guided Sketch Generative Adversarial Network (ASGAN) which is an end-to-end framework and contains two pairs of generators and discriminators. This suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a new dataset, which indicates that it may belong to the graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
