This is a classic problem in information theory, and the paper proposes a new decoding method for the system, which can be seen as an information-theoretic contribution. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper studies a decentralized multiuser MIMO system, which is a type of wireless network. The proposed opportunistic multiuser detection (OMD) method can be seen as a networking technique that improves the performance of the system. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with a multiuser system, where the users are coexisting and sharing the same spectrum. This can be seen as a social network, where the users interact with each other and compete for resources. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with a system that involves transmitting data over a wireless channel, which is a common problem in multimedia applications. The proposed OMD method can be seen as a technique for improving the quality of the transmitted data. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an iterative method for optimizing the transmit covariance matrices, which can be seen as a type of optimization problem.
