Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), which encompasses topics related to deep learning and RL. Additionally, the paper uses Atari 2600 games and a 3D driving simulator as experimental environments, which suggests that it may also fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also mentions using image-based inputs, which could place it under cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper discusses safety rewards, which could indicate a connection to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
