This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) as it involves image processing and feature extraction. The paper also addresses the interoperability problem of fingerprint sensors, which could be categorized under information retrieval (cs.IR) or cryptography and security (cs.CR). The use of Gabor-HoG descriptor suggests a multimedia (cs.MM) aspect to the research. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed method against state-of-the-art methods involves statistical analysis, which could be categorized under machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
