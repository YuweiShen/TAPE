The paper also introduces weaker variants of common knowledge that are attainable in many cases of interest, which involves logical reasoning and falls under the category of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). The concept of reasoning about knowledge is also related to Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), as it involves modeling human-like reasoning processes. The paper also discusses the act of transforming the system's state of knowledge, which involves information theory and falls under the category of Information Theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper discusses the relationship between common knowledge and desirable actions in a distributed system, which involves the study of social networks and falls under the category of Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
