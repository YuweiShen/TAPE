This involves developing a new source separation technique and using a multivariate GARCH model to discover causality in the time-varying variances of the sources. These techniques are relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), signal processing (cs.SI), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and statistical learning (cs.SD). Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
