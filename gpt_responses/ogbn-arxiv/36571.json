This involves decomposing the problem into scalar optimization subproblems, which are then optimized using neural networks and RL methods. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Additionally, the paper deals with optimization problems, which could fall under cs.RO (Robotics) or cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
