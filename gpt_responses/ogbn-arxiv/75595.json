The proposed method involves learning transformation offsets and adapting contextual information, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI). The paper also mentions using contextual embeddings, which are often used in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper uses deep neural networks, which are a common tool in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
