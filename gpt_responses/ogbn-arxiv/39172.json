This makes it highly relevant to the cs.GT sub-category.\n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) - The paper discusses the evaluation and ranking of agents in domains such as AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and Poker, which are all related to AI. Additionally, the paper leverages continuous- and discrete-time evolutionary dynamical systems, which are commonly used in AI research.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper involves the evaluation and ranking of agents, which is a common problem in machine learning. The paper also discusses the use of empirical games, which are commonly used in machine learning research.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper involves the study of multi-agent interactions, which is a common topic in social and information networks research. The paper also discusses the use of game-theoretic solution concepts, which are relevant to this sub-category.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper leverages dynamical systems theory to develop the {\\alpha}-Rank methodology, which makes it relevant to the cs.SY sub-category.
