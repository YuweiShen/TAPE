The paper draws connections between the lack of diversity in computing and biases encountered in datasets and machine learning models. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CY (Computers and Society), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
