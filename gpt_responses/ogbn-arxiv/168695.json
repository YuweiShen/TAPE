Therefore, cs.SE (Software Engineering) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of semantics-based techniques, which suggests that it may belong to cs.PL (Programming Languages) as well. Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of code transformation and detection accuracy, which are relevant to cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). The use of runtime information and similarity scores may also suggest a connection to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
