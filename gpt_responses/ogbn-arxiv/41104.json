The proposed network is also a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image analysis.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The dataset is designed for robots to recognize daily activities of the elderly, and the paper discusses the robot's working environment and service situations. The proposed network is also designed for robots to perform activity recognition.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel network called four-stream adaptive CNN (FSA-CNN) and discusses its properties, such as input-adaptive activation function and extension of the conventional two-stream approach.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of deep learning algorithms for activity recognition and proposes a new dataset to improve the performance of such algorithms.\n- cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper uses multiple modalities (RGB videos, depth maps, and skeleton sequences) for activity recognition and discusses the extension of the proposed network to deal with multimodal data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
