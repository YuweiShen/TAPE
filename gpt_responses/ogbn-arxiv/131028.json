Additionally, the control strategy proposed in the paper can be applied to other types of aerial robots. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper uses computational methods, such as the blade element method and finite-time convergent observer, to analyze and control the tilt-rotor aircraft. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The control strategy proposed in the paper involves a switched logic controller, which can be considered a type of artificial intelligence. \n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): Although the paper does not focus on software engineering, the control strategy proposed in the paper may require software implementation for practical applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
