The use of compression techniques for video transmission suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) category. The optimization of video quality involves mathematical formulations and programming, which could place the paper under the information theory (cs.IT) category. The use of cameras and image processing techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) category. Finally, the consideration of relays and the need for efficient routing suggests that the paper may also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
