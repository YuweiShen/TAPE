This involves computer vision (cs.CV) techniques for image processing and recognition, as well as machine learning (cs.LG) for developing recognition models. The use of infra-red (IR) images also suggests the involvement of computer graphics (cs.GR) or computer imaging (cs.MM) techniques. The paper also discusses the security aspects of biometric recognition, indicating the involvement of cryptography (cs.CR). Overall, the most likely categories are cs.CV and cs.IR, followed by cs.MM, cs.CR, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
