The approach leverages a deep generative model with a factored prior distribution that encodes properties of temporal invariances in the hidden feature set. Learning is achieved via variational inference, which is a common machine learning technique. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper deals with video data and proposes a method for disentangling object identity and pose information. This is a common problem in computer vision, and the proposed method could have applications in areas such as object tracking and recognition. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method for learning separable representations of object identity and pose information using unsupervised video data. This is a common problem in artificial intelligence, and the proposed method could have applications in areas such as robotics and autonomous systems. \n4. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper leverages a deep generative model with a factored prior distribution to learn separable representations of object identity and pose information.
