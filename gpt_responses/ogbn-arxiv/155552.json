The use of hyper-parameter tuning and pre-processing techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The use of a ResNet encoder and FCN decoder indicates that the paper may also belong to the neural networks (cs.NE) category. Finally, the use of MRI images suggests that the paper may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
