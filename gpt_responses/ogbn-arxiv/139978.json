This falls under the purview of information theory, making cs.IT the most likely category for this paper.\n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): Spatial modulation has the potential to improve the spectral and energy efficiency of wireless communication systems. This makes it relevant to the field of networking and internet architecture, which deals with the design and implementation of communication networks.\n\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The design and implementation of spatial modulation systems involves the use of control theory and system engineering principles. This makes cs.SY a likely category for this paper.\n\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): Spatial modulation can be applied in other signal domains such as frequency/time/code/angle domain or even across multiple domains. This makes it relevant to the field of multimedia, which deals with the processing and transmission of multimedia data.\n\n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): This category is less likely, but spatial modulation can be used in the context of wireless communication systems that involve natural language processing or speech recognition. This makes cs.CL a possible category for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
