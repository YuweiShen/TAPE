The proposed method is also implemented as a web-based checker, which is a software engineering artifact.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses symbolic execution, which is a technique from logic in computer science. The paper also proposes an algorithm for dynamically switching between different strategies, which involves some logical reasoning.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper draws inspiration from concolic testing, which is a technique from programming languages. The paper also proposes a method for combining random sampling and symbolic execution, which involves some programming language concepts.\n- cs.ET (Emerging Technologies): The paper proposes a new method for verifying hybrid systems, which can be seen as an emerging technology in the field of control and automation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
