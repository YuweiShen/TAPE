The paper uses data mining techniques to analyze historic authorship averages and current fractional contributions. The paper does not focus on any specific computer science subfield, but it does involve data analysis and information retrieval, which are relevant to several CS sub-categories such as digital libraries (cs.DL), information retrieval (cs.IR), databases (cs.DB), social and information networks (cs.SI), and computational complexity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
