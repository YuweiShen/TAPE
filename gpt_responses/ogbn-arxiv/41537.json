This topic is closely related to machine learning and data science, which are covered by the cs.LG and cs.DS sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of Gaussian dependency networks, which are a type of probabilistic graphical model commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The construction of coresets involves information theory (cs.IT) and optimization (cs.SI). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG, cs.DS, cs.AI, cs.IT, and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
