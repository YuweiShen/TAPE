This involves the use of specific immunostaining for glandular tissue and basal cells, as well as the development of a semi-automated data generation pipeline to annotate whole slide images. Given the focus on image analysis and machine learning, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), information retrieval (cs.IR), deep learning (cs.DL), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
