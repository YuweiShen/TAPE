This sub-category is the most likely fit for this paper.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): Fog computing is a networking paradigm that aims to address the challenges of cloud computing, such as latency and bandwidth limitations. This sub-category is also a likely fit for this paper.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): Fog computing involves the design and implementation of systems that can provision resources and services outside the cloud. This sub-category is a possible fit for this paper.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): Fog computing involves the development of software systems that can operate in a distributed and heterogeneous environment. This sub-category is a possible fit for this paper.\n- cs.AR (Hardware Architecture): Fog computing may require specialized hardware architectures to enable processing at the edge of the network.
