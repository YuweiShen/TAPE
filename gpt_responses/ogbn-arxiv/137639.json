The use of sparse channel estimation algorithms also suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and signal processing (cs.SP). The proposed method for selecting the regularization parameter involves Monte Carlo simulations, which is a numerical analysis technique that falls under numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
