Therefore, cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) is the most likely category. The paper also involves combinatorial analysis and complexity theory, which suggests cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) as likely categories. Additionally, the paper involves information theory and coding theory, which suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) as a possible category.
