The paper focuses on natural language processing and machine learning techniques, which are typically covered in the cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of neural networks, which are commonly studied in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-categories. The paper also involves the use of semantic memory, which is studied in the cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) sub-category.
