The method proposed in the paper involves computing distributed representations of event realizations based on distributed representations of predicates and their arguments, and then using these representations to predict prototypical event orderings. This approach involves techniques from natural language processing, machine learning, and neural networks, which are all sub-fields of computer science. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with the intersection of computer science and linguistics. \n\nThe paper also involves techniques from artificial intelligence (AI), such as learning from data and making predictions based on learned representations. Therefore, cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is another likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also involves techniques from machine learning (ML), such as joint estimation of model parameters and ranking components. Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) is another likely sub-category. \n\nThe paper also involves techniques from information retrieval (IR), such as ranking and retrieval of relevant information from texts. Therefore, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is another likely sub-category. \n\nFinally, the paper also involves techniques from neural networks (NE), such as distributed representations and compositional processes. Therefore, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is another likely sub"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
