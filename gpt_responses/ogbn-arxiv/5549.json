The use of machine learning techniques to learn these models makes it relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of classical planning algorithms, which is relevant to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The paper also deals with planning and plan generation, which is relevant to the programming languages (cs.PL) sub-category.
