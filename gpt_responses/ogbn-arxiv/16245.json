These topics are all related to the field of robotics (cs.RO). MRD is a machine learning technique, which suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in the context of robotics. Finally, the paper discusses the use of MRD for stability in robot grasping, which could be relevant to the sub-category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
