As such, it is likely to fall under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) categories. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of deep supervision and efficient gradient flow, which are topics commonly associated with artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed architecture on several image datasets, which could also place it in the multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
