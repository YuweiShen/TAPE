Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). The paper also introduces new operators that generalize self attention beyond 1x1 convolutions, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the use of the proposed operators for image similarity, which is a multimedia (cs.MM) application."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
