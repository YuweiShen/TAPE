The use of stigmergy approach based on ants behavior and swarm-based protocol for recruiting and coordinating robots also involves multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of wireless communication for distributed protocol design, which falls under the category of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the paper proposes a strategy for exploring an unknown area and disarming mines cooperatively, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
