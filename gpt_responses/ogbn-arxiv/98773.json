Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of various architectural choices on the effective receptive field, such as nonlinear activations (cs.NE), dropout (cs.LG), and skip connections (cs.AI). The paper also touches on the use of convolutional neural networks for natural language processing (cs.CL), although this is a relatively minor aspect of the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
