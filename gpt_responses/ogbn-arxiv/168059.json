The paper also introduces novel algorithms for simultaneously imposing sparsity and low rankness on the abundance matrix, which is a problem of optimization and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper uses a mixed penalty term consisting of the weighted $\\ell_{1}$ and the weighted nuclear norm, which is a topic related to information theory (cs.IT). The paper also uses a sliding square window to determine a small area of the image, which is a topic related to numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper conducts experiments on both simulated and real data, which is a topic related to scientific computing and simulation (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
