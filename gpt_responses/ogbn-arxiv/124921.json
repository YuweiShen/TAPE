The main focus is on computer vision techniques for analyzing facial expressions. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel end-to-end weakly-supervised attention and relation learning framework, which involves machine learning techniques. Hence, it is also likely to belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves the use of attention mechanisms, which is a popular topic in artificial intelligence research. Therefore, it could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Furthermore, the paper uses facial expression datasets, which are commonly used in multimedia research. Hence, it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of facial expression analysis in human-computer interaction. Therefore, it could also belong to cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
