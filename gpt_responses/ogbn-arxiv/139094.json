The protocol operates at the network layer, making use of routers, which suggests that it may also fall under the categories of computer networks (cs.NI) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the incentives for deployment of the protocol in local networks and upstream ISPs, which suggests that it may fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper presents a prototype implementation on PlanetLab, which suggests that it may also fall under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
