It may also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as kernel methods are commonly used in AI applications. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of Isolation Kernel in computer vision (cs.CV) and data science (cs.DS) applications. Finally, the paper's focus on dealing with a potentially infinite number of support vectors suggests it may also belong to the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
