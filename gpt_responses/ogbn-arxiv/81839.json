It proposes an ensemble machine-learning-based context-aware model for intelligent interruption management. The paper focuses on the human-computer interaction aspect of the problem, which falls under the category of Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC). The proposed model uses decision trees, which is a popular machine learning classification technique, and thus falls under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The model also takes into account multi-dimensional contexts, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR) and social computing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with the issue of privacy in mobile telephony, which falls under the category of Cybersecurity (cs.CY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
