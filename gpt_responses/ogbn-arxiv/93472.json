The use of cons-free programs and data orders also suggests a focus on programming languages (cs.PL) and logic (cs.LO). Additionally, the manipulation of storage space indirectly using the call stack may involve data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
