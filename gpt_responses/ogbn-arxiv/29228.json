The quadratic distortion measure is commonly used in multimedia applications such as image and video compression (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the impact of covariance matrix on the compression rate, which is a topic in statistical inference (cs.SI). The result of the paper is related to the optimality of Gaussian distribution, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
