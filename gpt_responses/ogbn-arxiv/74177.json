This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including Information Retrieval (cs.IR) for the use of natural language processing techniques to extract terms from patent texts, Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) for the use of word embedding algorithms to vectorize terms and establish their semantic relationships, Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) for the application of the TechNet to support a wide range of AI-based applications, Machine Learning (cs.LG) for the use of word embedding algorithms, and Databases (cs.DB) for the construction of a large-scale semantic network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
