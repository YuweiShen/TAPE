The use of Hadamard matrices to achieve perfect interference alignment is a signal processing technique, which suggests that cs.SI is a likely sub-category. The focus on minimizing communication and achieving optimal repair properties suggests that cs.IT and cs.DS are also likely sub-categories. The use of finite fields and extensions suggests that cs.DC is a possible sub-category. Finally, the connection to permutation-matrix based codes suggests that cs.NI is a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
