Specifically, it focuses on the $\\ell_1$ metric and doubling subsets, which are related to computational geometry and data structures. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). However, the paper also involves information theory (cs.IT), computational geometry (cs.CG), machine learning (cs.LG), and discrete mathematics (cs.DM) due to the use of randomized embeddings, covering sets, and grids."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
