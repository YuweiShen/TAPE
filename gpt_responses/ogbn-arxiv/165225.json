The use of Bayesian methods and Thompson Sampling also suggests a connection to machine learning. \n2. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new variant of Thompson Sampling and provides a sample complexity analysis for Bayesian stopping rules, which are both relevant to the field of artificial intelligence. \n3. cs.ST (Statistics): The paper deals with statistical inference in the context of multi-armed bandits, which is a topic of interest in statistics. The use of Bayesian methods and posterior convergence results also suggests a connection to statistics. \n4. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper deals with the problem of best-arm identification, which can be viewed as a problem of information acquisition and decision-making. The use of Bayesian methods and Thompson Sampling also suggests a connection to information theory. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The problem of best-arm identification can be viewed as a problem of control and optimization in the context of multi-armed bandits. The use of Thompson Sampling and the proposed variant T3C also suggest a connection to systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
