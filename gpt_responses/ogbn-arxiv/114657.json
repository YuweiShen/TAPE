This falls under the scope of information theory. \n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking) - The paper presents simulation results for QAM modulation over the AWGN channel, which is a common communication scenario. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper introduces a decoding algorithm for BMERA codes, which involves a specific data structure and algorithmic approach. \n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - Although not the main focus, the paper mentions the use of outer CRC codes, which are commonly used in network communication. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper discusses the performance of codes under different decoding schemes, which is relevant to network communication and internet architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
