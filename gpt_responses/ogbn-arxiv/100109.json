The paper also discusses the use of a physics-based renderer to generate synthetic data, which falls under computer graphics (cs.GR). The paper involves training a neural network, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper deals with the estimation of surface normals, which is a common problem in robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
