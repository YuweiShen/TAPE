Therefore, it is highly likely to belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a Convolutional Attention Network (CAN) for Chinese NER, which is a machine learning model. Hence, it is also likely to belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): NER is a subfield of NLP, which is a subfield of AI. Therefore, this paper could also belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The proposed model uses a character-based convolutional neural network (CNN) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) with global self-attention layer. Hence, it could also belong to this sub-category.\n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): NER is often used as a pre-processing step for information retrieval tasks, such as entity linking and relation extraction. Therefore, this paper could also belong to this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
