The proposed method involves training an ensemble of embeddings using online gradient boosting, which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG). The paper also discusses loss functions for increasing diversity in the ensemble, which is related to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the evaluation is done on several datasets, which is a common practice in natural language processing (cs.CL) and computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
