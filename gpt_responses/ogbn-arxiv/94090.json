This makes it highly relevant to the sub-category of Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper extends the Markovian state transition model to include transmission states that account for packet transmission failures due to errors caused by propagation through the channel, which falls under the sub-category of Information Theory (cs.IT). The paper also develops expressions for the saturation throughput as a function of system parameters, which is a characteristic of Performance (cs.PF) and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the paper uses simulation results to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed models, which is a common practice in the sub-category of Multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
