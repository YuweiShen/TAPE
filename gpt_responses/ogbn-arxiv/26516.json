The use of partial orders and the characterization of complexity suggest that the paper may also be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS). The analysis of different voting rules and their complexity may also be of interest to machine learning (cs.LG) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
