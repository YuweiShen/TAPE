This is a core problem in information theory.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the design challenges of future wireless networks, and proposes a solution for an underlay cognitive radio system that harvests RF energy from the primary system. This falls under the domain of networking and internet architecture.\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a control solution for the optimal time sharing between the EH and IT phases in a cognitive radio system, which is a problem in systems and control.\n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the achievable information rates in a cognitive radio system, which is relevant to multimedia applications that require high data rates.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper proposes an online solution for the optimal time allocation between the EH and IT phases in a cognitive radio system, which involves computational optimization techniques.
