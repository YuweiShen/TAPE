This involves optimization of power while meeting per-user average rate requirements. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory), which deals with the study of communication systems and their theoretical foundations. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of interference functions and an Alternating Optimization (AO) algorithm, which are commonly used in the sub-categories cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.SI (Systems and Control). \n\nThe paper also discusses the use of Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) constraints and statistical CSI, which are relevant to the sub-categories cs.MM (Machine Learning) and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
