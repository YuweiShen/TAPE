The paper focuses on incorporating Bayesian inference to make PlaNet uncertainty-aware. This involves incorporating both model and action uncertainty, which is represented using a neural network ensemble to approximately infer model posteriors. The paper also introduces the concept of the action ensemble, which relies on a general variational inference MPC (VI-MPC) framework and its instance, probabilistic action ensemble with trajectory sampling (PaETS). The paper experiments with continuous control tasks to compare the performances of the proposed method with PlaNet. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.RO (Robotics), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
