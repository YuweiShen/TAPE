The paper also discusses the use of belief propagation (cs.SI) for decoding and the impact of modulation schemes (cs.MM) and channel coding (cs.CR) on the performance of PNC. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.IT, followed by cs.NI, cs.SI, cs.MM, and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
