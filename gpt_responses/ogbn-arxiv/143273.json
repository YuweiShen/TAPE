The use of deep learning and neural networks in learning policies suggests a connection to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The incorporation of perceptual representation using deep learning also suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the mention of dynamic control systems suggests a connection to control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
