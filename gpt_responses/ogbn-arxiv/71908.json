It involves techniques from information theory (cs.IT) for maximizing the secrecy rate, networking (cs.NI) for scheduling transmissions, cryptography (cs.CR) for ensuring confidentiality, signal processing (cs.MM) for MIMO precoding and zero-forcing, and control systems (cs.SY) for self-interference suppression. Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
