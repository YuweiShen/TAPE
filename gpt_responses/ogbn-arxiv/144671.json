Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The method is based on deep learning and uses a Faster R-CNN architecture, which suggests that it could also be relevant to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions using non-maximum suppression, which is a common technique in information retrieval, suggesting that it could be relevant to cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper deals with text detection, which is a common problem in natural language processing, suggesting that it could also be relevant to cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
