Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction). \n\nThe paper also discusses the didactic use of the support card in undergraduate courses such as Software Engineering and Information Systems, which suggests that it could also belong to the cs.SE (Software Engineering) and cs.IT (Information Theory) sub-categories. \n\nFurthermore, the paper emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of HCI, which involves knowledge from various fields such as psychology, design, and engineering. This could make it relevant to the cs.ED (Education) sub-category, which focuses on the use of technology in education. \n\nFinally, the paper also touches on the importance of cybersecurity in HCI, which could make it relevant to the cs.CYBER (Cybersecurity) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
