The use of paracrine chemotaxis behaviours also suggests a connection to neural networks (cs.NE) and self-organizing systems (cs.SI). The study of network resilience and adaptation to changing environmental conditions is also relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) and computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
