The use of neural networks also suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper's focus on nonlinear potentials computed via a feedforward neural network also suggests that it could belong to cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). Finally, the use of structured inference and potential application to computer vision tasks suggests that it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
