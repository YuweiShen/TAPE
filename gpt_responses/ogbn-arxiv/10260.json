The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) also supports this assumption. Additionally, the use of graphical models and dynamic graph representations suggests that the paper may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The mention of iris and face recognition suggests that the paper may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category.
