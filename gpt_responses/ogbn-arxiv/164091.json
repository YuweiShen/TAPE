Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CC (Computational Complexity). The paper also discusses the application of Scarf's lemma in game theory and stable solutions, which suggests cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) as another likely sub-category. The paper also involves graph theory and digraphs, which could place it in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry) sub-categories.
