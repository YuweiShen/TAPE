It also involves the use of neural network classifiers, which are commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, suggesting that it could also belong to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category. Additionally, the use of supervised machine learning models indicates that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories.
