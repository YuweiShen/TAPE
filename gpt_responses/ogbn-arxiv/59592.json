It may also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category, as the optimisers are population-based and could be used for control applications. Finally, it could belong to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category, as the paper discusses novel optimisation strategies that are not found within conventional optimisers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
