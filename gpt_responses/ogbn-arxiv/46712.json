The paper also mentions graph-based transductive algorithms, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and social network analysis (cs.SI). The use of Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayesian bounds suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of statistical learning theory (cs.LG) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
