The paper also discusses the use of smoothing techniques, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR) to overcome data sparsity. The comparison of different smoothing techniques also involves evaluating their performance, which is a common task in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
