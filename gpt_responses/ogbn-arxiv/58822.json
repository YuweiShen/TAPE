The use of residual learning is a popular technique in deep learning (cs.LG), and the paper specifically mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are a type of deep learning model commonly used in computer vision. The paper also discusses the use of quantitative and visual assessments, which are common in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) research. The topic of image fusion also has applications in graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
