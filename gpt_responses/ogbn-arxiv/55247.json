It proposes a new student learning and forgetting model called DAS3H, which is based on additive factor models and includes a representation of the temporal distribution of past practice on the skills involved by an item. The paper also provides empirical evidence on three real-world educational datasets that DAS3H outperforms other state-of-the-art EDM models. Given the focus on machine learning and educational data mining, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.CL (Computation and Language), and cs.EDU (Computer Science and Education)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
