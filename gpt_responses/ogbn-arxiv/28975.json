The methods proposed for linear models and neural networks fall under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses preventing adversarial use of datasets, which falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of core-sets for improving privacy and preventing unwanted tasks also involves techniques related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper deals with the construction of fair core-sets, which involves techniques related to databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
