Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also uses deep neural language models, which falls under the sub-category cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper uses statistical methods for change point detection, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks). Finally, the paper analyzes language usage across different mediums, which could fall under cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
