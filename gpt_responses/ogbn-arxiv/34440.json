It also involves the use of deep convolutional networks, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of adaptive invariants, which suggests that it may belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. \n\nThe use of wavelets and the preservation of joint rotation and translation information suggests that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category. \n\nFinally, the study of stationary processes from a single realization suggests that it may also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
