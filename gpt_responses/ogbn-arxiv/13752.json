The proposed method involves a recurrent neural network, which is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments are conducted on a large-scale dataset, which is a common aspect of multimedia (cs.MM) research. Finally, the use of fewer parameters is a common goal in neural network optimization, which falls under the category of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
