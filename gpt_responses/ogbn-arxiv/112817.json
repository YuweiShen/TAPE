The paper also explores different design choices for the CNN architecture, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG). The use of motion information in addition to color information suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the efficiency and modularity of the proposed approach, which could be relevant to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the use of an ensemble of action unit detectors suggests a possible connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
