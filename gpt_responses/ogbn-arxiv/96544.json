Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of more complex features in deeper layers, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also presents a theoretical argument and investigates the practical implications, which could fall under neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) or computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
