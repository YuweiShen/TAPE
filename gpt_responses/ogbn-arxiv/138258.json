This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the use of communication and information theory (cs.IT) in the distributed setting. Additionally, the paper proposes algorithms that involve local gradient descent steps, which is a common technique in optimization (cs.MA). Finally, the paper investigates scenarios where the feedback is limited, which is a common problem in social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
