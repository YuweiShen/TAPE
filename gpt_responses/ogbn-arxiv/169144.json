The paper also discusses the need for more precise tracking of relevant variables like three-dimensional position, velocity, acceleration, and forces, which could fall under the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. The paper also mentions the potential for pose tracking to enable movement science to detect disease and quantify movement performance, which could fall under the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. The paper also discusses the metrics currently used for evaluating pose tracking algorithms, which could fall under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions the scientific disciplines that use movement data, which could fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
