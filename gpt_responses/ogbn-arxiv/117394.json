The approach involves a communication-memory tradeoff, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the sub-categories of \"Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing\" (cs.DC) and \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" (cs.DS). The paper also mentions the use of passive-aggressive updates, which are commonly used in the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the approach involves solving subproblems on minibatches, which is a common technique in the field of multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
