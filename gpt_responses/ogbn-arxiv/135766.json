It could also belong to cs.SI (Signal Processing), as source separation is a common problem in signal processing. The use of neural networks suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning), as this is a common area of research in that field. Additionally, the proposed derivative architectures suggest that it could belong to cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.SDQ (Sound and Music Computing), as these sub-categories deal with the design and optimization of systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
