The concept of social welfare is also central to the paper, which suggests that it could be relevant to social choice theory (cs.SI). The use of subjective cost functions and the analysis of network contribution games and atomic linear congestion games suggest that the paper could also be relevant to distributed systems (cs.DS) and social networks (cs.SOC). Finally, the paper explores the impact of altruism on equilibria, which could be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) in terms of designing agents that exhibit cooperative behavior."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
