This is a core topic in information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper studies a wireless network architecture with edge-nodes (ENs) connected to a cloud processor via dedicated fronthaul links, which is a key topic in networking and internet architecture. \n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper proposes transmission policies that encompass the caching phase as well as the transmission phase across both fronthaul and wireless, or edge, segments, which is related to distributed and parallel computing. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper addresses the interplay between cloud processing and edge caching from a systems perspective, and proposes transmission policies to minimize the NDT for given fronthaul and cache capacity constraints. \n5. cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) - Although not the main focus of the paper, the proposed transmission policies may have implications for hardware architecture design in cloud and cache-aided wireless networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
