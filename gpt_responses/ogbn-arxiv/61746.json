The paper proposes a general optimization framework for task sequencing in curriculum learning, which involves metaheuristic search methods. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also discusses the application of curriculum learning in animal training and pedagogy, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
