This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of adversarial training to control over-fitting, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper deals with medical imaging (cs.MM) and uses deep learning techniques for the task, which could also fall under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category.
