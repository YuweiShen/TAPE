The paper also discusses the use of backpropagation for training the lpRNN cell, which is a common technique used in machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the advantages of using low pass filters as temporal regularizers, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the lpRNN cell in ultra-low power edge computing, which falls under the category of embedded systems (cs.ET)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
