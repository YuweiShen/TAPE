The paper also discusses the use of batch normalization, which is a popular technique in neural network optimization and is often studied in the neural networks (cs.NE) community. The paper proposes a new optimization method that involves constraining the filters to lie on a unit-norm manifold, which is a technique that is often used in optimization problems in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
