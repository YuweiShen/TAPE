The code construction is deterministic and involves the use of graphs, which are also common in computer science (cs.CC, cs.DS). The paper also discusses the design of irregular codes, which is a topic in coding theory and optimization (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses a convergence result for sparse inhomogeneous random graphs, which is a topic in network science (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
