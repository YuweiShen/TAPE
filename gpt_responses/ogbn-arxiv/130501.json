The focus is on partial least squares regression (PLS), which is a technique for linear regression that is widely used in various fields. The paper proposes a novel approach called compression-based PLS (cPLS), which uses a grammar-compressed representation of data matrices to reduce working space and improve scalability. This approach is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), databases (cs.DB), information retrieval (cs.IR), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
