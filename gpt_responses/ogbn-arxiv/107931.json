This relates to the field of information theory, which deals with encoding and decoding information. \n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The problem of identifying lonely points in a simplex can be viewed as a geometric problem, where we want to find the vertices of the simplex that are not equivalent modulo L. This relates to the field of computational geometry, which deals with algorithms and data structures for geometric problems. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The problem of identifying lonely points can also be viewed as a numerical problem, where we want to compute the coordinates of the vertices of the simplex and check if they are equivalent modulo L. This relates to the field of numerical analysis, which deals with algorithms for solving mathematical problems numerically. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The problem of identifying lonely points can be solved using various algorithms and data structures, such as hashing, sorting, and searching.
