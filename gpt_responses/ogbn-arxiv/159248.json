The use of rate distortion theory to analyze the performance of the decentralized policies suggests a focus on information theory (cs.IT). The paper also involves learning local policies, which is a common theme in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the problem of coordination in multi-agent systems is a key issue in control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
