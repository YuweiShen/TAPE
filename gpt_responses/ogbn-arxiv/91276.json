This falls under the scope of distributed computing.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the inefficiency of DLT in IoT environments due to the unbalanced and unregulated network layout. The proposed communication protocol aims to address this issue by enabling nodes to calculate the tradeoff between connecting/disconnecting a peer. This involves networking and internet architecture concepts.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not explicitly discuss cryptography and security, but these concepts are relevant to DLT and may be mentioned in the context of the proposed communication protocol.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a system for optimising the network layout of DLT by continuously re-balancing and adjusting peers. This falls under the scope of systems and control.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper may mention data structures and algorithms used in DLT and the proposed communication protocol. However, this is less likely to be the main focus of the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
