This is a typical problem in systems and control. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with a MIMO block-fading channel, which is a typical channel model in wireless communication networks. \n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper does not directly deal with multimedia, but the results may have implications for multimedia applications that require reliable and efficient communication over wireless channels."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
