This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and security and privacy (cs.CR). The specific application of the technique to a cancer screening competition suggests computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as likely sub-categories. Finally, the iterative nature of the attack and the use of batches of examples suggests a focus on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
