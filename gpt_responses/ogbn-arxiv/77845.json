The use of tensor norms is a specific technique for regularization, which is also relevant to optimization (cs.Optimization) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The experiments involve both simulated and real data, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and statistics (cs.ST). Overall, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG, followed by cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.ST, and cs.NA."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
