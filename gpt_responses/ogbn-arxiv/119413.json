Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Additionally, the paper draws on ideas from the causal inference literature and the multilevel modeling literature, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.CY (Computers and Society). The paper also discusses concerns about underserving certain groups of users, which could place it in cs.SOC (Social and Behavioral Sciences) and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
