The use of Fourier measurements suggests that the paper may belong to the sub-category of cs.SP (Signal Processing). The algorithmic nature of the paper suggests that it may also belong to the sub-categories of cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The mention of empirical evaluation suggests that it may also belong to the sub-category of cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
