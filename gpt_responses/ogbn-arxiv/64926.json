The use of distributional semantics is also a key aspect of the paper, which falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also involves analyzing the growth rates of semantic neighbors, which could fall under the category of complex systems (cs.CC). Finally, the paper involves analyzing the frequency of words, which could fall under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
