The approach involves using locally-sampled RGB-D patches and a convolutional auto-encoder for regression. The paper also evaluates the method on three datasets and shows that it delivers robust detection results that compete with and surpass the state-of-the-art. Given the focus on computer vision and robotics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.RO (Robotics). The use of deep learning also suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as likely categories. Finally, the use of 3D object detection and pose estimation suggests cs.GR (Graphics) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
