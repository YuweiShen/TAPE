This is a topic of interest in information theory. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The planted clique problem is a well-known problem in network analysis, and the paper establishes a connection between this problem and the 2-norm of a tensor. \n- cs.CG (Computational Geometry): The paper uses concentration of measure, which is a technique commonly used in computational geometry, to prove its main result. \n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper presents a new result on the complexity of a certain problem (finding the 2-norm of a tensor), which is a topic of interest in data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
