Outlier detection in event sequences can be seen as a problem of anomaly detection in network data, which is a common topic in the field of social and information networks. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The detection of unexpected events in event sequences can be seen as a problem of intrusion detection, which is a common topic in the field of cryptography and security. \n- cs.ST (Statistics): The paper proposes outlier detection methods based on point processes, which are a type of stochastic process commonly used in statistics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
