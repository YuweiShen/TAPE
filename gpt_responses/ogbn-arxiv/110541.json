This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV). The platform also involves control development, which could fall under systems and control (cs.SY). The use of machine learning algorithms for object detection and tracking could also fall under machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of Matlab and the development of a modular platform could fall under programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
