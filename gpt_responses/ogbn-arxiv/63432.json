The use of reinforcement learning and multi-armed bandit algorithms suggests a focus on artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The consideration of fairness in candidate selection and its impact on team dynamics and system acceptance suggests a focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the use of theoretical guarantees and a large-scale user study suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
