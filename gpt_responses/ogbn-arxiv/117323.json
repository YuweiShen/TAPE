The use of polynomial families and reduction techniques also suggests a connection to computational complexity theory (cs.CC) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the mention of constructing arithmetic circuits suggests a connection to scientific computing (cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
