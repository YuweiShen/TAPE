Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of state-of-the-art MIML methods also suggests that it could belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Additionally, the evaluation metrics used in the study suggest that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
