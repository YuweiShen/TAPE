This involves designing an easy-to-use interface for domain experts who may have little or no expertise in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.HCI (Human-Computer Interaction). The paper also discusses the use of AutoML approaches, which falls under the category of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper discusses the framework used to ground the design choices, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the need for curation and refinement of the derived pipelines, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.DB (Databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
