The paper also discusses the use of penalties to avoid unnecessary disruptions to the environment, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also proposes a new deviation measure, which is related to the concept of reachability in robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper discusses the potential for bad incentives in the design of reinforcement learning agents, which is a topic that falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper proposes a new design for reinforcement learning agents, which is related to the field of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
