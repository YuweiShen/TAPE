The paper also mentions the use of 3D morphable models (3DMM), which is a machine learning technique (cs.LG) and involves optimization (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a novel methodology for face synthesis, which involves learning and generating new data, making it relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
