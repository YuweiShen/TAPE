The use of extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts and the proposed scattered EXIT chart also relate to network information theory (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses performance gains in terms of bit error rate (BER), which is a metric commonly used in communication and computer networks (cs.CC). Finally, the use of LDPC codes in practical applications such as digital storage and transmission also relates to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
