The method uses computerized methods for feature extraction and classification, which are common in computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The classifier is learned with a constructed feature descriptor, which is a common approach in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also studies the method's performance in dependency to the noise in a primary vertex position and deposited energy of particles, which is related to numerical analysis (cs.NE) and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
