The paper is focused on the architecture of the DNNs and how they can be trained to learn new tasks without forgetting previously learned ones. This is a common problem in machine learning, and the paper proposes a solution using progressive neural networks. \n\nBased on this description, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.CL (Computation and Language). These sub-categories are all relevant to the topic of machine learning and neural networks, and they cover different aspects of the research presented in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
