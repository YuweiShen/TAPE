The use of MMSE as a disturbance constraint suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI). The paper also discusses the phase-transition phenomenon, which is a topic in statistical physics and machine learning (cs.MM). The use of upper and lower bounds suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of numerical analysis (cs.NI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
