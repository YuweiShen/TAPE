This involves formal representation of knowledge, identification and treatment of hazards, and tool-supported modeling of faulty behaviors. These topics are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including software engineering (cs.SE), systems and control (cs.SY), cryptography and security (cs.CR), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
