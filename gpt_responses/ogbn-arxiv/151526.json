The paper also involves propositional formulas and logical relations, which are topics in logic and complexity theory (cs.LO). The algorithmic aspects of the paper suggest that it could also be classified under data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
