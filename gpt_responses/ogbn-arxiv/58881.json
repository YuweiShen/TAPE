The use of Shapley values as an alternative to proportional shares for distributing costs among players is a key feature of the studied games, which suggests the category of algorithms for decision making (cs.DS) as another likely sub-category. The paper also presents an algorithm that uses sampling techniques to achieve polynomial running time, which is a common approach in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the price of anarchy of the studied games, which is a concept that relates to the efficiency of equilibria and is relevant to the category of economics and computation (cs.EC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
