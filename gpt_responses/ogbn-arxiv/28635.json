The paper focuses on the runtime adaptation of communication parameters, which is related to network protocols and optimization (cs.NI). The analysis also involves the control of limited radio resources, which is related to information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper proposes changes to the ADR mechanism to improve its agility, which is related to control systems (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
