The approach involves using all available chart, lab, and output events without the need for pre-processing or feature engineering. The use of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of EHR data and the focus on prediction of in-hospital mortality suggests that the paper may also belong to the categories of cs.CE (Computational Epidemiology), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.DB (Databases)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
