The paper proposes a new fixed-ratio lossy compression framework that respects user-specified error constraints. This problem is related to several sub-categories of computer science, including cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science), cs.DB (Databases), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). However, given the focus on compression and data size reduction, cs.DC and cs.NA are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.CE, cs.DB, and cs.LG."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
