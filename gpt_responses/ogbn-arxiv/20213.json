Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses algorithms for intertextual alignment and text classification, which are related to information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML), respectively. Hence, cs.IR and cs.LG (Learning) are also likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper mentions the development of basic language tools such as a stemmer and word segmenter, which are fundamental tasks in NLP and ML. Therefore, cs.DL (Digital Libraries) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
