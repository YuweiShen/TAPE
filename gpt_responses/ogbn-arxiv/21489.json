The use of social choice methods and individual rankings provided by workers suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the theoretical and experimental analysis of the problem involves concepts from game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
