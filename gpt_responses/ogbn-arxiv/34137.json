Therefore, cs.AI is the most likely sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of Evolutionary Algorithms and Monte Carlo Tree Search, which are machine learning techniques, so cs.LG (Machine Learning) is also a likely sub-category. The paper also analyzes the performance of the algorithms in different games, which falls under the sub-category of Game Theory (cs.GT). The paper also mentions the use of computer vision techniques to analyze the games, which falls under the sub-category of Computer Vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper discusses the use of population-based methods, which is a subfield of Neural Networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
