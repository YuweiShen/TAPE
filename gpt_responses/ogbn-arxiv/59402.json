This suggests that the paper belongs to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) sub-category. The use of Prolate Spheroidal Wave theory also suggests that the paper may belong to the scientific computing (cs.SC) or computational algebra (cs.CA) sub-categories. The focus on convergence rates and algorithmic complexity suggests that the paper may also belong to the numerical analysis (cs.NA) or systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Finally, the use of Fourier series and the Gibbs phenomenon suggests that the paper may also belong to the signal and image processing (cs.SD) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
