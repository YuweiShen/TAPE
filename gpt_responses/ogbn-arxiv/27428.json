The paper also presents an algorithm for establishing a tight bound within a minimal amount of search, which involves techniques from artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper discusses maximizing the sum of the values of coalitions, which is a concept from game theory (cs.GT). The paper also involves searching through a large number of possible coalition structures, which involves techniques from data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
