The paper proposes a novel strategy for addressing the data deficiency problem in few-shot learning, which involves using unlabeled images to enhance the labeled ones. This approach involves selecting semantic similar images on the fly and using them to replace the original labeled images for the next epoch training. This strategy is based on a pseudo labeling strategy, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also focuses on improving feature representation and generalization, which are key topics in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper involves natural language processing techniques, such as semantic similarity, which is a topic in computational linguistics (cs.CL). Finally, the paper proposes a sophisticated network architecture, which involves training a model to learn a decision boundary for classification, which is a topic in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
