The study focuses on the performance of these frameworks on convolutional networks, which is a common application in computer vision (cs.CV). The evaluation of hardware utilization and speed is also relevant to the sub-categories of neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the study involves the implementation and optimization of deep learning algorithms, which is related to the sub-category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
