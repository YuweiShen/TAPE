The paper also establishes a connection to the Min-Plus-Convolution problem, which is of particular interest in fine-grained complexity theory and falls under the category of information theory and coding theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), and cs.IT (Information Theory). Additionally, the paper involves mathematical optimization and numerical analysis, which could place it under cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
