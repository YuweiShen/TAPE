Additionally, the paper proposes a joint space model of ngram-HMM language model to facilitate the application to various tasks, which is a common research area in cs.CL. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of non-parametric Bayesian construction, which is a common research area in cs.LG (Machine Learning). \n\nFurthermore, the paper discusses the potential of NPLM to complement potentially 'huge' monolingual resources into the 'resource-constraint' bilingual resources, which is a common research area in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). \n\nThe paper also involves the use of system combination in the area of SMT, which is a common research area in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). \n\nFinally, the paper discusses the treatment of noise in NPLM, which is a common research area in cs.SD (Sound)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
