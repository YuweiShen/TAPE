This topic is closely related to several sub-categories of computer science, including digital libraries (cs.DL), information retrieval (cs.IR), social and information networks (cs.SI), computational complexity (cs.CY), and databases (cs.DB). However, given that the paper focuses on citation analysis and publication graphs, we believe that cs.DL and cs.IR are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
