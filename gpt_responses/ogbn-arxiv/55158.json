The paper also discusses the use of synthetic training examples, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The authors propose a novel approach to building an image contrast invariant model, which involves building approximate forward models of pulse sequences, and this could fall under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category. The use of neural networks for segmentation also falls under the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) category. Finally, the paper discusses the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition protocols, which could fall under the Multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
