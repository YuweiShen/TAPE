The proposed algorithm uses statistical hypothesis tests, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.AI) and statistical learning (cs.LG). The paper also evaluates the proposed method using a novel dataset, which could fall under the category of computer vision datasets (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
