This falls under the domain of machine learning, specifically reinforcement learning.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new approach to building policies in reinforcement learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper involves multiple agents working together to learn and improve their policies. This falls under the domain of distributed computing.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper addresses the privacy requirement of data and models in reinforcement learning and proposes a method to protect them. This falls under the domain of cryptography and security.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper involves multiple agents working together, which can be seen as a social network. Additionally, the proposed approach involves sharing information between agents, which falls under the domain of information networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
