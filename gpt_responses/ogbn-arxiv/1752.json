The channel is a nonlinear optical fibre, which is a type of network infrastructure (cs.NI). The paper also discusses input distributions and constellations, which are topics in optimization and algorithms (cs.OH) and signal processing (cs.SI), respectively. Finally, the paper involves the study of a physical phenomenon, namely soliton amplitude modulation, which falls under the category of physics and society (cs.PH)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
