Information theory is closely related to the study of communication systems and network coding, which are the main topics of this paper.\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a relay selection scheme for a two-way relay network, which is a type of wireless network. The proposed scheme aims to improve the end-to-end symbol error rate (SER) performance of the network.
