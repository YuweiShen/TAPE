This involves image processing and computer vision techniques, which are typically covered in the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also involves graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM) aspects, as it deals with reconstructing objects in three-dimensional space from holograms captured by an imaging device. Finally, the use of CNNs for regression is a common technique in the neural networks (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
