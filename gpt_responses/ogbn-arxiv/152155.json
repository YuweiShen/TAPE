The paper also proposes an approach that adapts online using real-world execution, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The approach also accounts for discrepancies in dynamics during planning, which involves control systems (cs.SY). The paper provides provable guarantees on the completeness and efficiency of the proposed framework, which involves theoretical computer science (cs.PL). Finally, the paper uses simulations and real-world experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which involves machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
