The paper also discusses the performance of modern neural network architectures, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper presents theoretical results on the approximation error of Taylorized models, which could fall under systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
