The paper also discusses the partition of resources into time applied to reformulation and time used for inference, which is relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). The use of probability distributions and heuristic search methods suggests a focus on data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), while the empirical study of determining the ideal amount of time to devote to searching for clusters in belief networks suggests a focus on software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
