This falls under the category of machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI). The method involves modifying the graph operation to help the dummy super node learn graph-level features, which could also be related to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) where similar techniques are used. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of focal loss to address class imbalance, which is a common problem in neural networks and could be related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
