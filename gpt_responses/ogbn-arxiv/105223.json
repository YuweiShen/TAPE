The use of residual on the residual structure and feature attention suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The evaluation of the proposed method on multiple datasets suggests that it may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
