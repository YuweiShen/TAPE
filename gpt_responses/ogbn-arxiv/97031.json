The paper also discusses the application of these techniques in the context of NASA's HyspIRI mission, which involves analyzing large corpuses of text to identify scientific opportunities and gaps in earth science research. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the use of semantic measurement extractions to facilitate scientific investment and research, which could be relevant to the software engineering (cs.SD) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
