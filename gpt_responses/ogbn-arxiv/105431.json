This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also derives analytical expressions for the downlink coverage probability, which involves system-level analysis and optimization, and hence could be categorized under systems and control (cs.SY). The use of multiple antennas and antenna selection also suggests a connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and communication networks (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
