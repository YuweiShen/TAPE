The use of compressive sensing techniques is central to the proposed algorithms, which suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Signal Processing (cs.SP) categories. The paper also deals with statistical tests and numerical simulations, which are common in the Statistics (cs.ST) and Numerical Analysis (cs.NA) categories. Finally, the paper proposes new algorithms that exploit the structure of the cyclic autocorrelation, which suggests that it could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
