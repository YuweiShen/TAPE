This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses deep learning (DL) as a potential solution to beamforming, which suggests that it may also belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses complexity reduction, which suggests that it may belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper mentions computer simulation and testbed results, which suggests that it may also belong to the Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
