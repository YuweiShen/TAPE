The use of neural networks also suggests the category of neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also deals with optimization algorithms, which can be categorized under systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the experiments involve symbolic regression problems, which can be categorized under data mining (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
