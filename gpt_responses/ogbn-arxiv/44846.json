The use of dynamic algorithms suggests that the paper may also belong to the data structures and algorithms category (cs.DS). The problem of packing squares into a square is closely related to the problem of packing rectangles into a rectangle, which is a well-studied problem in computational geometry and optimization (cs.CG, cs.DM). Finally, the paper presents lower and upper bounds, which are often studied in the context of computational complexity (cs.CC) and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
