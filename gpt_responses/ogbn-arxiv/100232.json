Additionally, the paper proposes a novel approach to studying program equivalence in higher-order languages, which is relevant to programming languages (cs.PL) and software engineering (cs.SE). The paper also specifically mentions linear PCF, which is a type of functional language, indicating that the paper may fall under the category of formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL). Finally, the paper uses labeled transition systems, which is a topic that falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
