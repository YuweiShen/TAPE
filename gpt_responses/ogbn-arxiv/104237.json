Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the models' shortcomings and avenues for future research, which suggests that it could also belong to the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.MM (Multimedia). Additionally, since the EPIC-Kitchens dataset captures daily actions in-situ, it could also belong to the sub-category of cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
