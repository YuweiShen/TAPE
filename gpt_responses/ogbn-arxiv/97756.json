It is also likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as Word2Vec is a popular implementation of word embeddings used in many downstream tasks, and the paper proposes a new approach to training these models. Additionally, it may belong to the Computation and Language (cs.CL) sub-category as the paper deals with natural language processing and word embeddings. Finally, it may also belong to the Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) sub-category as the paper uses graph analytics frameworks to distribute the Word2Vec training process."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
