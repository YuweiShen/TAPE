The use of algebraic tools and Boolean functions suggests a focus on information theory (cs.IT) and computational complexity (cs.CC). The mention of a new kind of equations system also suggests a focus on discrete structures (cs.DS) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
