This involves training deep generative models with low privacy cost and obtaining an analytic sensitivity of the kernel mean embedding. These techniques are commonly used in machine learning and data privacy research, suggesting that cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) are likely sub-categories. The paper also deals with generating synthetic data for various types of datasets, including tabular data, input features and labels, and high-dimensional data, indicating that cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.DB (Databases) are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
