The specific problems mentioned, such as sorting arrays, computing convex hulls, and polynomial multiplication, are all related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and computational geometry (cs.CG). The use of entropy as a measure of difficulty suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and complexity theory (cs.CC). Finally, the mention of Delaunay triangulations suggests a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
