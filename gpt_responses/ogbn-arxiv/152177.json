This involves generating a new, tailored language for the application. \n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper discusses how this approach provides increased control to the platform owner, preventing certain classes of errors by the developer. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper focuses on resource access control and preventing leaking of private data in the domain of mobile computing. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses enforcing operational constraints in reactive applications, which involves controlling the behavior of the system. \n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper does not explicitly mention distributed computing, but the approach of generating a new language for the application could potentially be useful in distributed systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
