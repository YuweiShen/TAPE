Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes a new loss function for deep metric learning, which falls under the scope of cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper uses exponential feature projection space, which is a common technique in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) for feature extraction. The paper also evaluates its method on two face recognition datasets, which falls under the scope of cs.MM (Multimedia). Finally, the paper uses CNNs for its experiments, which is a common technique in cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
