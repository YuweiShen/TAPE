This involves concepts from discrete mathematics, number theory, and combinatorics, which are typically studied in computer science subfields such as data structures (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL), computational complexity (cs.CC), and graph theory (cs.GT). Additionally, the paper uses techniques from fractal geometry and analysis, which are relevant to several other subfields of computer science, such as computer graphics, computer vision, and machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
