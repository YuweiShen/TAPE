The paper uses natural language processing techniques such as semantic role labeling and XLNet as the backbone of the approach. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). Additionally, the paper also uses machine learning techniques such as graph neural networks, which suggests that it could also belong to sub-categories such as cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also deals with information retrieval and knowledge representation, which could place it in sub-categories such as cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
