This makes it relevant to the sub-category of Logic in Computer Science.\n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes three possible solutions to the fuzzy MaxSAT problem, which involves developing algorithms to find the maximum number of satisfied formulae. This makes it relevant to the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms.\n4. cs.PL (Programming Languages) - The paper proposes three possible encodings to solve the fuzzy MaxSAT problem, which involves developing programs to find the maximum number of satisfied formulae.
