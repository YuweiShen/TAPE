The proposed approach involves learning dictionaries for image patches, which is a common technique in the field of sparse coding and dictionary learning (cs.MM). Finally, the paper presents experimental results on both synthetic and real data, which suggests that it may also be relevant to the graphics (cs.GR) community."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
