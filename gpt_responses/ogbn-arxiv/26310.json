The paper proposes a new family of loss functions called \"peer loss\" functions and shows that performing empirical risk minimization with these loss functions on noisy datasets leads to optimal or near-optimal classifiers. This work is relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and cryptography (cs.CR). However, given the focus on learning with noisy labels, we believe that cs.LG is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.AI and cs.CV."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
