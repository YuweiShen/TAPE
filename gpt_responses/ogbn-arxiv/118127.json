The paper proposes a method to generate a codebook for Bag-of-Words model using metric learning techniques. \n2. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses supervised metric learning techniques to generate the codebook. This falls under the domain of machine learning. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with visual descriptors and distance metrics for person re-identification, which is a multimedia application. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): Person re-identification can be seen as a retrieval task, where the goal is to retrieve images of the same person from a large dataset. The paper proposes a method to improve the retrieval performance using metric learning. \n5. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a method to improve the performance of person re-identification using machine learning techniques, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
