The use of higher-order logic suggests that it may belong to cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) or cs.PL (Programming Languages). The paper also mentions type systems, which could place it in cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) or cs.SE (Software Engineering). Finally, the topic of program analysis and correctness could also place it in cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
