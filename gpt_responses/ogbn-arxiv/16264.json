This involves computer vision (CV) techniques such as image classification and segmentation, as well as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods. The use of a deep neural network also suggests a focus on deep learning (LG). Additionally, the paper involves the use of a novel data set, which could fall under information retrieval (IR) or multimedia (MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
