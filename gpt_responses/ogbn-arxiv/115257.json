It also involves an axiomatisation of Shannon entropy, which could fall under the category of data structures (cs.DS) or interactive theorem proving (cs.ITP). The paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks (cs.SI) as entropy is often used in network analysis. Finally, the paper may involve some computational complexity (cs.CC) in terms of analyzing the complexity of the new proof of Fadeev theorem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
