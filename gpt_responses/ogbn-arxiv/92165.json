The paper also discusses the use of deep learning (cs.LG) for distance computation. Additionally, the paper involves information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques for indexing and searching images. The use of a neural framework for encoding suggests a potential application in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper mentions the use of clustering (cs.MM) for indexing, which is a common technique in machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
