This falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a generative adversarial network (GAN) for extracting side information and subspaces, which falls under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed approaches quantitatively and qualitatively, which falls under neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
