The proposed feature extractors are used in applications of audio and image processing, indicating relevance to computer vision (cs.CV) and signal processing (cs.SD). The use of deep learning and neural networks suggests relevance to machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the automatic configuration process and bio-inspired approach suggest relevance to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
