The authors use communication complexity theory to formulate definitions of privacy-approximation ratio, which is a topic that falls under information theory (cs.IT). The paper also involves analyzing the efficiency of communication protocols, which is a topic in distributed systems (cs.DS) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the authors use probability distributions to demonstrate improved privacy-approximation ratios, which is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
