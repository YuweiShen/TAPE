The paper proposes a new network architecture for improving the feature representations of RoIs in object detection. This involves attention mechanisms, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of a detection subnetwork, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on several datasets, which is relevant to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
