Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the use of transfer learning and fine-tuning, which are common techniques in machine learning and deep learning. This suggests that cs.LG (Machine Learning) is another likely sub-category. The paper also deals with document classification, which falls under the sub-categories of cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Finally, the paper discusses the use of customer call satisfaction prediction, which is a practical application of NLP and machine learning. This suggests that cs.SD (Software Engineering) may also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
