This method involves AI techniques such as machine learning and data analysis. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper builds a driver attention prediction model using the proposed dataset and HWS method, which involves machine learning techniques. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper discusses the importance of predicting driver attention for autonomous driving, which is a human-computer interaction problem. The proposed dataset and model aim to improve the interaction between human drivers and autonomous systems. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper discusses the importance of predicting driver attention for autonomous driving, which is a robotics problem. The proposed dataset and model aim to improve the performance of autonomous driving systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
