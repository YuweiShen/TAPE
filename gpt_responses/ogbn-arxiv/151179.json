The study also involves numerical simulations and evaluation of error vector magnitude, which falls under the categories of modeling and analysis (cs.MA) and networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implications of the results, which relates to system engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
