This falls under the category of distributed and parallel computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the convergence and capability of the framework to reduce training time, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The specific models used in the analysis, AlexNet and GoogLeNet, are both commonly used in computer vision tasks (cs.CV). The paper also mentions exploring novel ways to reduce communication overhead, which is a common challenge in neural network training (cs.NE). Finally, the paper releases the framework as open-source for further research, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
