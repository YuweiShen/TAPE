This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the need for novel CNN architectures tailored to brain images, which could fall under the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed architecture using mean absolute error (MAE), which could fall under the computational linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
