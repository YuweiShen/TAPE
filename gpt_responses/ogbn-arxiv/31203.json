The problem involves broadcasting information to multiple receivers, which suggests that it could also belong to the networked systems sub-category (cs.NI). The paper also mentions the use of spectral techniques in the analysis, which is a common tool in the study of graph theory and linear algebra, suggesting that it could belong to the data structures and algorithms sub-category (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the task-based restriction on embedded index coding, which could fall under the social and information networks sub-category (cs.SI). Finally, the paper presents an explicit construction for the linear embedded index code, which could also fall under the complexity theory sub-category (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
