It also discusses the use of finite-length codes and periodic decoding, which are relevant to coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also considers the penalties of using a sequence of specified decoding times, which is related to scheduling and network protocols (cs.SI, cs.NI). Finally, the paper discusses the performance of the system as the expected latency grows, which is a topic in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
