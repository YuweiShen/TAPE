This problem is motivated by the practical problem of a firm's CEO estimating (non-regular) beliefs about a sequence of events, before acting on them. The paper uses tools from information theory, statistics, and machine learning to study the asymptotic behavior of the minimum achievable mean squared error distortion at the CEO in the limit when the number of agents and the sum rate tend to infinity. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). However, the paper also deals with distributed systems (cs.DS), statistical inference (cs.SI), machine learning (cs.LG), and multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
