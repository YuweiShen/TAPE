The paper proposes a novel framework for ensemble selection using meta-learning and feature selection. The paper also proposes an optimization procedure based on the formal definition of the Oracle. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DM (Data Mining), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CV (Computer Vision)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
