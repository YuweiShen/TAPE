This involves training the network using transfer learning and data augmentation techniques. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The proposed method involves using a CNN to analyze electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for the detection of MI. This can be considered as a form of signal processing and analysis, which falls under the domain of computer vision. \n3. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper involves the use of a neural network (CNN) for the detection of MI, which falls under the domain of neural computing. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The proposed method involves the use of machine learning techniques for the detection of MI, which falls under the domain of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The proposed algorithm can assist specialists in detecting MI signals more precisely, which involves the interaction between humans and computers."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
