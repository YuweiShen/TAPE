The paper also discusses the use of Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) techniques, which are commonly used in distributed optimization algorithms (cs.DC). The paper also mentions the use of consensus-based protocols, which are a common tool in control systems and robotics (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of tracking mechanisms and gradient estimation, which are commonly used in neural networks and other optimization algorithms (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the impact of communication overhead on convergence speed, which is a topic that falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
