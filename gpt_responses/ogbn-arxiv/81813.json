The paper also discusses the optimal sharing pattern of computational resources within the network, which involves determining the best way to allocate resources for efficient computation, indicating a focus on machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper deals with emotion classification, which is a subfield of multimedia (cs.MM), and the dataset used for training includes ethnicity labels, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
