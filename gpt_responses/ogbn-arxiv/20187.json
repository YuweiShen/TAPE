The use of human feedback and control signals also suggests a focus on human-robot interaction (cs.HC). The use of actor-critic reinforcement learning is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and the comparison of different training approaches suggests a focus on machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the use of both physical and simulated robotic systems suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
