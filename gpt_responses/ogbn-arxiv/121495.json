It also uses proximal policy optimization techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning. Additionally, the paper may also be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories as it deals with policy learning and control. The system (cs.SY) sub-category may also be relevant as it involves control and optimization. Finally, the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category may be relevant as the proposed algorithm is evaluated on continuous control benchmarks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
