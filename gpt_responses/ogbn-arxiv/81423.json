The paper also uses combinatorial designs to construct coded caching schemes, which falls under the category of discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science (cs.DS). The paper also deals with the optimization of cache and channel usage, which is a topic in networking and communication (cs.NI). Additionally, the paper proposes novel constructions for coded caching, which falls under the category of algorithms and complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implications of coded caching, which is a topic in systems and control (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
