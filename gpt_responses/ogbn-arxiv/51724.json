Therefore, it is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper proposes a method for learning to bridge the visual gap between photos in a story, which involves training a neural network to generate a plausible story even with missing photos. This involves using techniques from machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method using automatic metrics, which involves information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
