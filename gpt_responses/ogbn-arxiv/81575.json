This involves combining the advantages of learning complex data transformations across multiple time series from deep global models with per-series localization offered by closed-form linear models. The paper also discusses the use of RNN-like update operations and maintaining sufficient statistics of conditional Gaussian distributions. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), social and information networks (cs.SI), and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
