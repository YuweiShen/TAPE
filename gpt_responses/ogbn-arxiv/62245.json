This involves decision-making for multiple drivers and considering the problem from a system-centric perspective. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the paper uses deep reinforcement learning for decision-making. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning) as the paper involves learning methods for resource allocation problems. \n- cs.MA (Multiagent Systems) as the paper deals with multiple drivers as individual agents. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control) as the paper considers the problem from a system-centric perspective. \n- cs.RO (Robotics) as the paper deals with fleet management and dispatching problems in a ride-sharing platform marketplace."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
