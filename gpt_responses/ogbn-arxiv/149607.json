This problem is essential for a range of visual tasks related to human-computer interaction, which suggests that the paper could belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) or natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. The paper proposes a Cross-Modal Relationship Extractor (CMRE) and a Gated Graph Convolutional Network (GGCN) to extract multi-order relationships from the referring expression and associate them with the objects and their related contexts in the image. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) or machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with multimodal information fusion and structured relation graph propagation, which suggests that it could also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
