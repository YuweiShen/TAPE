The paper proposes a technique that achieves this goal for an extremely large fraction of path queries by exploiting the structure of the social networks. This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SOC (Social and Economic Networks), cs.DB (Databases), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
