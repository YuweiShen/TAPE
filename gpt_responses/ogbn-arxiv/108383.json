The paper specifically focuses on controlling the amount of verbatim copying in abstractive summarization, which involves language modeling and alternative mechanisms for generating summary hypotheses. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and related topics. Other likely sub-categories include cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), as these sub-categories also cover topics related to NLP and machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
