The paper also mentions the need for fast signal processing due to accelerated system dynamics, which suggests a connection to the subfield of systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper emphasizes the use of modern tools and methods, which could be related to the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also provides illustrative examples, which could be related to the subfield of numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper discusses the practical implications of the new paradigm in signal processing, which could be related to the subfield of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
