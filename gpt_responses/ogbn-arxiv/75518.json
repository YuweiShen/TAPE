This topic is closely related to the areas of logic (cs.LO), programming languages (cs.PL), software engineering (cs.SE), formal languages and automata theory (cs.FL), and distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DS). However, since the paper focuses on the development of a logical formalism, we consider cs.LO and cs.PL to be the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.SE, cs.FL, and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
