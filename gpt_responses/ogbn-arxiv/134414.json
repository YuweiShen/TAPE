The paper presents a new algorithm for vertex connectivity that breaks the quadratic time barrier for small values of $k$, and also presents a new approximation scheme. This suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under topics related to graph algorithms and combinatorial optimization, such as data structures (cs.DS), discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational geometry (cs.CG), computational complexity (cs.CC), and game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
