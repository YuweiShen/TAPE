The paper proposes a new training algorithm called Population-Contrastive-Divergence (pop-CD) and compares it to Contrastive Divergence (CD), which is a widely used RBM training algorithm. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The paper also includes experiments on image datasets, which suggests that it may also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision). Finally, the paper discusses the variance of the gradient estimate, which is related to information theory, so it may also belong to cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
