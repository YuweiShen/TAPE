This involves aspects of network infrastructure, wireless communication, and information theory, which are covered by the sub-categories cs.NI, cs.IT, and cs.COM. Additionally, the paper specifically focuses on mmWave networks, which are covered by the sub-category cs.MM. Finally, the paper also discusses the impact of spatial correlation on network coverage, which falls under the sub-category cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
