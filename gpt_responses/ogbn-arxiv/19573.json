Therefore, cs.CV is the most likely sub-category. The paper also focuses on the optimization problem and regression, which are core topics in machine learning (ML) and optimization (LG). Thus, cs.LG is the second most likely sub-category. The paper also mentions the use of hashing for information retrieval (IR), which is another relevant sub-category. Additionally, the paper evaluates its method on image datasets, which falls under multimedia (MM) and artificial intelligence (AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
