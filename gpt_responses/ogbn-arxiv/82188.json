The paper proposes a new approach based on Lagrangian duality and complex domain analysis to compute globally optimal solutions for PGO. This makes the paper relevant to several sub-fields of computer science, including robotics (cs.RO), computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), signal processing (cs.SI), and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
