Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also discusses the performance of different CLE models, which suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper evaluates the models on downstream tasks, which could fall under cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
