This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also proposes a new algorithm for feature matching, which involves selecting submatrices and choosing a scoring metric, which could be considered a machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) problem. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed algorithm on multiple benchmarks, which involves testing the system's accuracy and robustness, and could be considered a systems and control (cs.SY) problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
