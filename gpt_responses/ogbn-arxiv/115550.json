Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves information theory and signal processing techniques, which suggest possible categories of cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.COMM (Communications and Networking). The evaluation of the schemes using simulations and system-level tools may also relate to cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
