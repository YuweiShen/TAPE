The use of incidence bounds, which are a tool from combinatorial geometry, suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) sub-categories. The paper also presents algorithms with improved running times, which could be of interest to the cs.CC (Complexity Theory and Cryptography) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
