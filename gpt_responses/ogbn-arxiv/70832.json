This involves topics such as numerical optimization, symbolic computation, and algebraic geometry. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.SC (Symbolic Computation), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.DS (Dynamical Systems). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of algorithms such as cylindrical algebraic decomposition and critical point method, which are related to computational geometry (cs.CG) and optimization (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
