Information theory often deals with finite fields and their properties, making this a likely category.\n- cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the regularity of generalized bent functions, which is a property related to complexity. Additionally, the paper mentions connections between the Walsh spectrum and components of these functions, which could be of interest to researchers in computational complexity.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): Bent functions are often used in cryptography, and the paper discusses generalized bent functions and their properties. This makes cs.CR a likely category.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper discusses the properties of functions on $\\mathbb{Z}_2^n$, which is a discrete structure. Additionally, the paper mentions connections between the Walsh spectrum and components of these functions, which could be of interest to researchers in data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This category is less likely, but the paper does mention connections between the Walsh spectrum and components of these functions, which could be of interest to researchers studying network structures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
