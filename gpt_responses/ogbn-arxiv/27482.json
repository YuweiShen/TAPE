This falls under the domain of systems and control. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the impact of customer engagement plans on customers and their willingness to participate in Demand Response Programs (DRP). This falls under the domain of computers and society. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper designs algorithms to evaluate the impact of power throttling states and plan parameters on peak load reduction. This involves the use of AI techniques for optimization and control. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper may involve the use of machine learning techniques for predicting customer behavior and preferences, which can inform the design of customer engagement plans. \n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper may discuss the security and privacy implications of customer engagement plans, as they involve the grid operator accessing and controlling customer devices."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
