The paper uses a sentence encoder and multiple predictors to identify different characteristics of the target word from the input query. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): This sub-category covers topics related to natural language processing, which is the main focus of the paper. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): Reverse dictionary can be seen as a type of information retrieval task, where the goal is to retrieve a set of words that match a given description. \n- cs.LG (Learning): The paper proposes a machine learning model for reverse dictionary, which suggests that it could belong to this sub-category. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): Reverse dictionary is a task that requires artificial intelligence techniques, such as natural language processing and machine learning. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper uses a neural network-based model for reverse dictionary, which suggests that it could belong to this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
