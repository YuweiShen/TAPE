Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also involves deep learning techniques, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) a likely category as well. Additionally, the paper involves normalization techniques, which could fall under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of depth images could also fall under cs.MM (Multimedia) and the use of neural networks could fall under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
