The use of planar subgraphs and the study of their properties suggest a connection to graph theory (cs.DS), and the discussion of different trade-offs between the number of bends and the required drawing area involves optimization and approximation algorithms (cs.DM). The study of connected spanning subgraphs also suggests a connection to graph theory and combinatorics (cs.GT), while the consideration of bending edges suggests a connection to computational geometry and visualization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
