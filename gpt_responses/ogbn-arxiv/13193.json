The proposed algorithm also involves semi-supervised learning (cs.AI) and graph theory (cs.SD). Additionally, the paper evaluates the algorithm's performance on image-set classification datasets, which falls under natural language processing and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
