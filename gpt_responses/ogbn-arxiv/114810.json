The model uses intrinsic motivation to drive the learning process and explores the relationship between the configuration space of the arm, sensing joint angles through proprioception, and visual perceptions of the hand and grippers. The paper draws on constraints from the empirical literature on infant behavior and presents significant progress in learning to make grasps reliable. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.RO (Robotics), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
