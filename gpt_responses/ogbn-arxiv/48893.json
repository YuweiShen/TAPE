This work involves robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV) techniques. The paper also mentions the concept of time-to-transit, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the research involves studying the sensorimotor systems of bats, which falls under the category of computational biology (cs.BIO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
