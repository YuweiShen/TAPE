The paper also proposes a method that learns the matching function, which is a common problem in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of contextual features, which is a common technique in robotics (cs.RO) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
