This falls under the domain of machine learning.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper evaluates the proposed framework in two real-world settings involving robots (Baxter and TurtleBot) performing tasks. This falls under the domain of robotics.\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision): The paper uses sequences of images to demonstrate the desired task and to train the policy. This falls under the domain of computer vision.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a new paradigm for imitation learning that reduces the reliance on expert supervision. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper proposes a policy that can be used to control the behavior of a robot in performing a task. This falls under the domain of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
