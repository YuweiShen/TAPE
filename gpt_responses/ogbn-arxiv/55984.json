This technique improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain at each receive antenna and allows for the use of subspace decomposition-based techniques such as MUSIC for direction finding. Additionally, the transmit beamformers can be designed to yield multiple data sets with rotational invariance property, allowing for the use of search-free direction finding techniques such as ESPRIT or PARAFAC. This paper involves signal processing, estimation, and optimization techniques, which are commonly found in the arXiv CS sub-categories of Information Theory (cs.IT), Signal Processing (cs.SI), Systems and Control (cs.SY), Machine Learning (cs.LG), and Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
