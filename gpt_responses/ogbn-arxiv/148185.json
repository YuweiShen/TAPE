The proposed framework also integrates software-defined networking and network function virtualization, which are networking technologies. \n2. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper briefly mentions security as one of the design benefits that can be added to the system. \n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper discusses the energy consumption in communication nodes, which is a distributed computing problem. The proposed framework aims to reduce energy consumption by integrating recent technologies. \n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a framework that integrates the active system with software-defined networking, which can be seen as a control problem. \n5. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper briefly mentions the performance benefits that can be added to the system, which can be related to information theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
