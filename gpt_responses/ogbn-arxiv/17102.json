The use of static symmetry-breaking ordering constraints is a technique commonly used in constraint programming (cs.PL) and logic programming (cs.SE). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of graph-based representations to identify symmetries, which is a topic in discrete mathematics and combinatorics (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
