This topic falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper proposes a scheduler network, which is a machine learning model, to determine whether to detect or track at a certain frame. This involves making decisions based on the tracking quality, which is a form of reinforcement learning and falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper also discusses the efficiency of trackers, which is related to robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Finally, the paper validates its approach on the ImageNet VID dataset, which is a multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
