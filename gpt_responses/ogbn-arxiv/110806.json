The use of pilots to estimate channel quality is a common technique in wireless networks (cs.NI). The paper also deals with optimizing network throughput and energy efficiency, which are topics in systems and control (cs.SY). The use of variable-length coding is a common technique in multimedia communication (cs.MM). Finally, the paper uses numerical optimization techniques, which are commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
