The proposed two-stage schedule-and-align (TSSA) scheme involves user scheduling and beam search, which can be considered as a control and optimization problem in system engineering (cs.SY). The use of distributed remote radio units (RRUs) also suggests a potential connection to multimedia (cs.MM) and computer architecture (cs.AR) subcategories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
