The use of an example-based method and the k-nearest neighbor method suggest that this paper may also be relevant to the categories of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Machine Learning (cs.LG). The exclusion of noise in the bilingual corpora may also make this paper relevant to the category of Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE). Finally, the use of semantic matching and the translation of modality may suggest that this paper is relevant to the category of Information Retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
