This falls under the domain of computer vision, making cs.CV the most likely sub-category. \n2. cs.SD (Sound): Lipreading involves processing both visual and audio information, and while this paper focuses on the visual aspect, it is possible that the authors have also considered audio features in their approach. Hence, cs.SD (Sound) is a likely sub-category. \n3. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper involves the use of deep learning models for speech recognition, which is a natural language processing (NLP) task. Hence, cs.CL is a possible sub-category. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture for lipreading, which involves the use of CNNs, RNNs, and CTC loss. This falls under the domain of machine learning, making cs.LG a possible sub-category. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): While this sub-category may not seem directly relevant, it is possible that the authors have considered social or contextual information in their approach, which could be relevant for lipreading in certain scenarios.
