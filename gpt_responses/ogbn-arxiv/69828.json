This suggests that the paper may belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms category.\n2. cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper deals with a resource allocation problem with convex costs and constraints, which is a common problem in game theory. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Game Theory category.\n3. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper discusses the time complexity of the proposed algorithm for both continuous and integer cases. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Computational Complexity category.\n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an algorithm for solving a resource allocation problem, which is a common problem in machine learning. This suggests that the paper may belong to the Machine Learning category.\n5. cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper discusses the complexity of obtaining an $\\epsilon$-approximate solution for the continuous case, which involves numerical analysis.
