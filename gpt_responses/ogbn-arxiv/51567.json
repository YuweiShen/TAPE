The proposed model uses representation learning and recurrent neural networks to learn the embedding trajectories of users and items, and introduces a novel projection operator to estimate the future embedding trajectory of a user/item. The paper also presents a scalable algorithm for training the model. Based on these characteristics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.SOC (Computational Social Science), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
