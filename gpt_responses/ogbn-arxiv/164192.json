The problem of determining objective rating scores is a key issue in information retrieval, and the paper proposes a new algorithm to address this problem. \n2. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper discusses the vulnerability of online rating systems to collusion attacks, which is a common problem in social networks. The proposed algorithm is designed to be robust against such attacks, making it relevant to this sub-category. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The paper proposes a new iterative algorithm for calculating rating scores, which involves learning from data. The algorithm is based on a continuous mapping and a constrained optimization objective, which are common techniques in machine learning. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - The paper discusses the problem of collusion attacks in online rating systems, which is a security issue. The proposed algorithm is designed to be robust against such attacks, making it relevant to this sub-category. \n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) - The paper proposes a new algorithm for calculating rating scores, which involves manipulating and analyzing data. The algorithm is based on iterative filtering, which is a common technique in data structures and algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
