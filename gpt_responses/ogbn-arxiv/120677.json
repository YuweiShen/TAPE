The proposed method involves improving feature extraction, which is a common problem in machine learning and falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves image processing techniques such as binarization and distance transform, which fall under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR) and multimedia (cs.MM). Additionally, the paper proposes a new approach to improve recognition, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
