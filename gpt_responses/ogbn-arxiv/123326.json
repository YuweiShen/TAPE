This involves analyzing the performance achieved by the new NOMA transmission scheme, which falls under the purview of information theory. \n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the use of FRAB and NOMA in wireless networks, which is a key area of research in networking and internet architecture. The paper discusses the use of beamformers and multiple access techniques to improve network performance, which is a key concern in this field. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of beamforming and multiple access techniques to improve the performance of wireless networks. This involves designing and analyzing control systems that can optimize the use of these techniques, which falls under the purview of systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of FRAB and NOMA in millimeter-wave networks, which are often used for high-bandwidth multimedia applications. The paper discusses the use of beamformers and multiple access techniques to improve network performance, which is a key concern in this field. \n5. cs.COM (Computers and Society): The paper does not directly deal"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
