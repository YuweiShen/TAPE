It involves the use of feature models and domain knowledge to guide the search for better solutions. Therefore, it is likely to belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Systems and Control (cs.SY) categories. Additionally, the paper involves the use of mutation and crossover operators, which are commonly used in Programming Languages (cs.PL) and Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
