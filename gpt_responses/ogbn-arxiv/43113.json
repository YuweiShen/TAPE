The paper also introduces a new algorithm that achieves full multiplexing gains and unbounded near-optimal caching gains, which involves coding and optimization techniques that are commonly studied in the sub-fields of coding theory (cs.SI) and optimization (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the implications of the new algorithm on the role of coded caching in multi-antenna environments, which is a topic that falls under the broader area of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
