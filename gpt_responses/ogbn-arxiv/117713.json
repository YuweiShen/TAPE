The paper discusses the low computational complexity of the proposed method, making it attractive for implementation in big data settings. The experiments conducted in the paper involve traffic signal control and contextual bandits, which are both related to machine learning and artificial intelligence. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SY (Systems and Control). The paper also discusses the use of least squares regression and provides finite-time bounds for stochastic gradient descent, which are related to data science (cs.DS) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
