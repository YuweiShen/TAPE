Additionally, the paper mentions the use of deep learning architectures, which is a common technique in the field of computer vision. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of xNets to enhance key-points based object detection, which suggests that it may also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. \n\nThe fact that the architecture achieves high accuracy while using fewer parameters and training faster than other architectures suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-categories. \n\nFinally, the mention of mapping objects with different sizes and aspect ratios into layers suggests that the paper may also belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category, as this is a common problem in robotics applications such as object detection and tracking."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
