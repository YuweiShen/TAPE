The paper focuses on the kNN classifier and proposes a robust version of it that is able to handle unknown asymmetric label noise. The paper also proposes a new method for estimating the maximum of a function that may be of independent interest. Given these topics, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.ST (Statistics), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
