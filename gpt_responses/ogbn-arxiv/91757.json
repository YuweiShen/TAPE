This context calls for pricing decisions that intelligently trade off between maximizing revenue generated by a current product and probing to gain information for future benefit. The problem is framed as one of reinforcement learning and leverages Thompson sampling. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.MA (Multiagent Systems), cs.GT (Game Theory), and cs.EC (Economics and Computation)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
