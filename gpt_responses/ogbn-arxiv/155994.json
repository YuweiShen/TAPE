The proposed plastic neural memory access mechanism is specifically designed to improve the performance of NMNs in anomaly detection tasks, which often involve analyzing medical data such as EEG and MRI scans (cs.CV, cs.NE). The paper also discusses language modeling, which falls under the category of natural language processing (cs.CL). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG and cs.AI, followed by cs.CV, cs.NE, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
