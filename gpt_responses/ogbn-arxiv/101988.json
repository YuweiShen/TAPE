The paper also discusses experiments conducted on the OFELIA testbed, which is a platform for testing network protocols and architectures, further supporting the relevance of cs.NI and cs.AR. Additionally, the paper discusses the interworking of ICN with CCN/NDN architecture, which falls under the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). The paper also proposes solutions to support ICN, which involves system and control theory (cs.SY), and discusses security aspects of ICN, which falls under the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
