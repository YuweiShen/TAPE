The paper also discusses hardware implementation of the decoding algorithm, which could fall under the architecture (cs.AR) or embedded systems (cs.ET) sub-categories. The use of unrolling technique for decoding is a common optimization technique in digital signal processing (cs.DS), which could also be relevant to this paper. Finally, the paper discusses the error-correction performance of the decoder, which could fall under the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
