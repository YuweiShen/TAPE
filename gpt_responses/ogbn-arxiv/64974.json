Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel training scheme for CNNs, which involves controlling the amount of textural information available during training. This suggests that the paper could also be relevant to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), which are all related to the development and optimization of machine learning algorithms. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on various image classification tasks, which could also place it in the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
