The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) categories. The use of hyperspectral imaging systems suggests that it could also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) category. Finally, the use of saliency maps suggests that it could belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
