The proposed method involves training a deep network to better distinguish adversarial examples from normal ones, which is a task related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Therefore, these five sub-categories are the most likely ones for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
