The proposed approach involves the use of a Genetic Algorithm, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for optimization problems. The use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction is also a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of a Fisher Vector pooling technique, which is commonly used in multimedia analysis (cs.MM) for feature encoding. Finally, the paper discusses the creation of a new dataset, which is relevant to information retrieval (cs.IR) and data mining (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
