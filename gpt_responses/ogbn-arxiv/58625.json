The paper proposes a new approach to matrix completion that does not require the joint incoherence assumption, which is a standard but unintuitive and restrictive condition that is imposed by previous studies. The paper provides a sample complexity bound that is orderwise optimal with respect to the incoherence parameter, rank, and matrix dimension up to a log factor. The paper also discusses extensions to other related problems such as singular value decomposition projection, structured matrix completion, and semisupervised clustering. Finally, the paper shows that the joint incoherence condition is unavoidable for the problem of low-rank-plus-sparse matrix decomposition, which is related to the planted clique conjecture. Based on these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
