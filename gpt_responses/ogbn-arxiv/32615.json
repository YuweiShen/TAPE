This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI). The proposed approach also involves sparse representation (cs.LG) and image processing (cs.CV) techniques. Additionally, the paper uses simulation and numerical analysis (cs.NA) to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
