The use of quantiles in decision making is based on recent advances in distributional reinforcement learning, which falls under the category of deep reinforcement learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the performance advantage of QUOTA in physical robot simulators (cs.RO) and video games (cs.CV). Additionally, the use of optimism and pessimism in value distribution is related to decision making under uncertainty, which is a common theme in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
