Therefore, the most likely category is computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also proposes a new family of models using AutoML search space, which involves machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of depthwise convolution and kernel sizes also relates to neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed method on object detection, which falls under natural language processing and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
