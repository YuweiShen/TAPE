The paper also discusses the reduction of model size and computational intensity, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The use of linear algebra techniques in deep learning models may also make it relevant to the Mathematical Methods in Computer Science (cs.MM) sub-category. The paper's focus on video classification may also make it relevant to the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the use of state-of-the-art network architectures and thorough experiments may make it relevant to the Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
