The use of correlation as a resource and the analysis of common randomness capacity suggest that the paper may also belong to the categories of computational complexity (cs.CC) and cryptography (cs.CR). The analysis of capacities may involve the use of mathematical models and algorithms, which could place the paper in the categories of mathematical modeling (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
