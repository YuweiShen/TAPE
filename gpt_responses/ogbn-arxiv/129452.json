The paper also mentions different perspectives on deep learning from various disciplines such as mathematics, physics, computation, and neuroscience. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
