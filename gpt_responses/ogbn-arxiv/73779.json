The focus on human-specific decision-making also suggests a potential fit for the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-category. Additionally, the use of a propositional architecture for distilling an interpretable representation of each human demonstrator's decision-making suggests a potential fit for the robotics (cs.RO) and social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
