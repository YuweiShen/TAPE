The paper analyzes the performance of two popular on-line algorithms, Gradient Descent (GD) and Exponentiated Gradient (EG), in the PCA setting. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), which are also relevant to the analysis of on-line learning algorithms. Additionally, the paper involves numerical optimization and matrix analysis, which are relevant to cs.NA (Numerical Analysis) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
