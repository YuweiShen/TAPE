The use of perturbations and regularization is also a common technique in these fields. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also involves mathematical analysis and optimization theory, which could place it in cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
