The paper proposes a weakly-supervised transfer learning method that uses mixed 2D and 3D labels in a unified deep neural network, which involves training a 2D pose estimation sub-network with a 3D depth regression sub-network. This suggests that the paper may also fall under the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper introduces a 3D geometric constraint to regularize the 3D pose prediction, which involves geometric reasoning and may suggest that the paper falls under the sub-category of graphics (cs.GR). Finally, the paper deals with human pose estimation, which is a common task in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
