The paper discusses the implementation and testing of the attack on intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and proposes a new metric to quantify the effectiveness of the attack. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CR (Cryptography and Security). Other likely sub-categories include cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture), cs.SE (Software Engineering), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
