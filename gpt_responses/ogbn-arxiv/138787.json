The simulations and experiments are conducted on real-life and synthetic datasets, which indicates that it may also belong to Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the geometric interpretation of the phenomenon using the neural tangent kernel, which suggests that it may belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) sub-category. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of the phenomenon, which suggests that it may also belong to the Computation and Language (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
