The proposed scheme is a probabilistic fingerprinting scheme that efficiently generates the fingerprint by considering a fingerprinting probability and publicly known inherent correlations between data points. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the categories of computer security (cs.CR), information theory (cs.IT), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), databases (cs.DB), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
