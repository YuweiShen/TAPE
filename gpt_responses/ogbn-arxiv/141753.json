This falls under the domain of systems and control.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper uses metaheuristics to evolve strategies for team pursuit track cycling. This falls under the domain of artificial intelligence.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper may also fall under the domain of social and information networks as it involves a team of cyclists working together to achieve a common goal.\n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): The paper may also fall under the domain of software engineering as it involves developing and implementing an optimisation framework for team pursuit track cycling.\n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper may also fall under the domain of computational engineering as it involves using computational methods to solve a real-world problem in the domain of sports."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
