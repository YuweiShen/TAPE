Additionally, the paper mentions using similarity measures for templates, which is a common technique in NLP. \n\nThe paper could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) because bootstrapping is a machine learning technique and the paper introduces a new bootstrapping method. \n\ncs.LG (Machine Learning) is another likely sub-category because the paper deals with iterative expansion of a set of initial seed instances, which is a common technique in machine learning. \n\ncs.IR (Information Retrieval) is a possible sub-category because the paper deals with extracting relationships from text, which is a common task in information retrieval. \n\nFinally, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is a possible sub-category because the paper mentions using a confidence assessment technique, which could potentially involve neural networks or evolutionary algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
