The paper also mentions the use of single-step options, which is a technique commonly used in reinforcement learning (cs.LG). The focus on driving and safety suggests that the paper may also fall under the categories of robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of planning methods, which could suggest a connection to computer vision (cs.CV) for perception and mapping."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
