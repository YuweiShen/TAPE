Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the training of CNNs, which falls under cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of different loss functions for face recognition also involves Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper uses two widely used face datasets, which falls under Multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also discusses the security aspect of face recognition, which falls under Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
