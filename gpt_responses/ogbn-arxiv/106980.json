The paper proposes a Global-to-Local Knowledge Selection (GLKS) mechanism that uses a distantly supervised learning schema to learn a topic transition vector. This vector is used to guide the local KS at each decoding timestamp. The paper uses natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve this. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
