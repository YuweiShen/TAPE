The paper's focus on algorithms and mathematical characterizations suggests that it belongs to the Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) and Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. The paper also deals with graph theory and computational geometry, which are covered by the Computational Geometry (cs.CG) sub-category.
