The focus of the paper is on the EM algorithm and its variants, which are widely used in this context. The paper addresses the challenges of using regularization in the high-dimensional setting, which is a common problem in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also deals with statistical guarantees, which suggests that it could belong to cs.ST (Statistics) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
