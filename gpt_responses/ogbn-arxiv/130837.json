The paper also discusses physical world attacks using printed posters and wearable clothes, which could fall under the computer graphics (cs.GR) or multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. The study of transferability of attacks between datasets, object classes, and detector models suggests a machine learning (cs.LG) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the use of adversarial training to suppress objectness scores could also fall under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
