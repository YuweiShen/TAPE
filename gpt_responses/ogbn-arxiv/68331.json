The use of the principle of equivariance to symmetry transformations also suggests a focus on machine learning and deep learning (cs.LG), as well as neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the implementation of these networks on manifolds suggests a potential connection to geometric deep learning (cs.GR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
