The paper discusses techniques for collecting multi-label annotations for temporal data such as videos, which is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM) research. The paper also discusses cost-effective strategies for obtaining these annotations, which involves analyzing and optimizing the performance of crowdsourcing techniques, a topic that falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method in collecting annotations for human activities, which is a common topic in natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
