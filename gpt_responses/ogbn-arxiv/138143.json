Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper proposes a training recipe to improve the adversarial robustness of DNNs, which involves integrating an adversarial perturbation-based regularizer into the classification objective. This suggests that the paper could also belong to sub-categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CR (Cryptography and Security), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
