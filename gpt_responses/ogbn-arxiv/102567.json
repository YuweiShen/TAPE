The paper focuses on improving the accuracy of object detection and segmentation, which falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The proposed architecture involves learning new correlations from feature maps, which is a common technique in deep learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses enhancing the semantic information of the feature pyramid, which is related to natural language processing (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
