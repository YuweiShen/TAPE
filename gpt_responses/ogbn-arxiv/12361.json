It may also belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as the proposed method is highly desirable for autonomous driving applications. The use of uncertainty estimations and multi-loss function suggests that it may also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Additionally, the paper involves the use of deep learning models, which may place it in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper may also belong to the natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category as it involves the use of a technical language and terminology."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
