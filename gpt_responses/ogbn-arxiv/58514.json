It also proposes a solution using OpenFlow, which is a popular protocol for software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). \n\nThe paper may also belong to the sub-category of Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) as it discusses stateful control functions and their deployment in network protocols, which are relevant to security and privacy. \n\nThe sub-category of Architecture (cs.AR) is also likely as the paper proposes modifications to the hardware architecture of OpenFlow switches to support stateful control functions. \n\nThe sub-category of Systems and Control (cs.SY) may also be relevant as the paper discusses the control of network functions and the use of Mealy (Finite State) Machines to abstract control functions. \n\nFinally, the sub-category of Programming Languages (cs.PL) may be relevant as the paper proposes a platform-agnostic specification for control functions and an application programming interface (API) for their deployment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
