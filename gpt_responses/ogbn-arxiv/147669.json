The authors also mention the importance of satisfying the localization demand of today's smart devices, which further supports this category. \n\n2. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper discusses the use of ultrasonic beacons for positioning, which can be seen as a form of information retrieval. The authors also mention the use of algorithms for localization, which further supports this category. \n\n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper presents a practical ultrasonic positioning system, which involves the design and implementation of hardware and software components. This aspect of system design and control is relevant to this category. \n\n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of indoor beacons for positioning, which can be seen as a form of networking. The authors also mention the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communication between the beacons and smart devices, which further supports this category. \n\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper discusses the use of ultrasonic beacons for positioning, which can be seen as a form of multimedia. The authors also mention the use of microphones in smart devices, which can be considered as a multimedia input/output device."}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
