It proposes a new method for computing unbiased stochastic gradients for spectral-sums, which is an important subclass of spectral functions. The paper also discusses the convergence rate of the proposed stochastic methods. Given these topics, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). Other likely sub-categories include cs.NA (Numerical Analysis), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.CV (Computer Vision), as these fields often involve optimization problems and spectral functions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
