The paper also discusses the privacy parameter and its impact on the error rate, which is a key concern in privacy and security (cs.CR). The paper also uses techniques from information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG) to develop its results. Finally, the paper discusses general results beyond heavy hitters, which could potentially fall under the category of privacy-preserving algorithms (cs.PR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
