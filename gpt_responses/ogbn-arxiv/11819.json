The paper also discusses the use of multiple antennas (MIMO) to improve the performance of wireless networks, which is a common topic in information theory.\n2. cs.GT (Game Theory) - The paper uses cooperative game theory to model the behavior of rational nodes in a wireless network. The paper also discusses the stability of the grand coalition, which is a common topic in game theory.\n3. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper deals with the problem of cooperation between nodes in a wireless network, which is a fundamental problem in networking and internet architecture. The paper also discusses the use of multiple access channels, which is a common topic in networking and internet architecture.\n4. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the stability of transmitter cooperation in a wireless network, which is a problem that can be analyzed using systems and control theory. The paper also discusses the use of interference cancelling strategies, which is a common topic in systems and control.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper deals with the problem of achieving higher throughputs in a wireless network, which is a fundamental problem in multimedia applications. The paper also discusses the use of multiple antennas (MIMO)"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
