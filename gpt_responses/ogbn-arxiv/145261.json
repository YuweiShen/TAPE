The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) also suggests that it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper proposes a novel loss function for optimizing linear constraints on the output space of a CNN, which could also place it in the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The experiments involve extensive use of images, which could also suggest the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves optimization techniques, which could also place it in the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
