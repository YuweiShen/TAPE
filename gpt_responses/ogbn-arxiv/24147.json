Therefore, cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.LG (Machine Learning) are the most likely categories. The paper also discusses the use of differential privacy, which falls under the category of privacy-preserving data analysis, making cs.CY (Computers and Society) and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) likely categories as well.
