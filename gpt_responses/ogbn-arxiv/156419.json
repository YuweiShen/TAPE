This falls under the domain of data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). The paper also presents time and space complexity analyses, which are relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC). The techniques involve tree structures and graph algorithms, which are related to computational geometry (cs.CG). Finally, the paper discusses succinct representations of indexes, which is a topic in information theory and compression (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
