This involves the use of auto-encoders for unsupervised representation learning and locality sensitive hashing for similarity assessment. The paper also applies this method to the specific task of predicting Acute Hypotensive Episodes (AHE) in ICU patients. Based on these factors, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CV (Computer Vision), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
