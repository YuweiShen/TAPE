This falls under the category of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also uses techniques from information theory (cs.IT) and linear algebra (cs.DS). The Fourier basis is a common tool in computational complexity theory (cs.CC) and signal processing (cs.SI), which are also relevant to the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
