The paper also discusses the development and refinement of deep models, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a visual analytics approach for understanding and diagnosing deep CNNs, which involves the use of graph theory and clustering algorithms, making it relevant to the fields of neural networks (cs.NE) and scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
