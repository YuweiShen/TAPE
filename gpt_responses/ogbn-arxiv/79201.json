The problem is also related to computer vision (cs.CV) as the authors model the problem of face recognition from video as a multiple measurement vector problem. The use of randomized algorithms and Monte Carlo simulations suggests a numerical analysis (cs.NA) aspect to the paper. Finally, the proposed algorithm involves modifying the Kaczmarz algorithm, which is a well-known iterative method in numerical linear algebra (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
