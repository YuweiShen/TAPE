This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The use of deep learning networks also falls under the deep learning (cs.DL) sub-category. The paper involves the use of a large database of digital mammography exams, which could also fall under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the evaluation of the model using free receiver operating characteristic (FROC) analysis, which could also fall under the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
