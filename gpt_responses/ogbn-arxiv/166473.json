The paper also discusses the implementation of these techniques in a live programming tool, which could be considered software engineering (cs.SE). The use of constraint-based type inference techniques could also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) applications. Finally, the paper's focus on tackling advanced typing features could be relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
