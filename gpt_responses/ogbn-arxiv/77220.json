This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the object-capability discipline, which is related to program security, indicating that the paper may also belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) or Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) sub-categories. The paper also presents a formalization of the approach as a type system and evaluates existing Scala open-source code, suggesting that it may belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) or Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
