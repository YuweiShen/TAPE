It also involves the concept of anonymity, which is related to security and cryptography (cs.CR). The use of correlated randomness suggests a possible connection to distributed systems (cs.DS) or networked information systems (cs.NI). Finally, the problem of anonymous communication may have applications in social networks or online privacy (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
