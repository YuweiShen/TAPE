This is a problem that is commonly studied in the fields of machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also proposes a new method for solving this problem, which involves recovering the row space of a latent representation. This method is based on assumptions about the underlying structure of the data, which suggests that it may be relevant to information theory (cs.IT) and signal processing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper emphasizes the scalability of the proposed method, which suggests that it may be relevant to the field of data science (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
