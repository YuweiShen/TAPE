The use of cycle pointing and the dissymmetry theorem suggests that the paper may also be relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG) and computational complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the study of graph symmetries and random generation of graphs is also relevant to graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
