The codes are also used for stabilizing unstable plants across noisy channels, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY). The paper proposes a decoding algorithm with low complexity, which is relevant to the field of networked control systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the tradeoffs between communication resources and control performance, which is a topic in data science (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
