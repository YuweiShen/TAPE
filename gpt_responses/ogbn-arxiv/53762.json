The focus on deep neural networks suggests that the paper is likely to be categorized under cs.LG (Machine Learning), while the discussion of uncertainty estimation techniques suggests that it could also be categorized under cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of deep neural networks for image classification and detection tasks suggests that the paper could also be categorized under cs.CV (Computer Vision), while the use of Bayesian inference and discriminative classification suggests that it could be categorized under cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
