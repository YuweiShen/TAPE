The paper proposes a new sparse GP framework that uses expectation propagation to directly approximate general GP likelihoods using a sparse and smooth basis. This framework can be applied to various problems such as regression and classification, which are covered by the sub-categories of cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.ST, and cs.NE. Among these sub-categories, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) are the most likely ones as they are the most relevant to the topic of the paper. The other sub-categories are also relevant as they cover related topics such as computer vision (cs.CV), statistics (cs.ST), and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
