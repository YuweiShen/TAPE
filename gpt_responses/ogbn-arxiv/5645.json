This suggests that the paper could belong to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.AI (artificial intelligence), cs.LG (machine learning), cs.MA (multi-agent systems), cs.CV (computer vision), and cs.RO (robotics). Among these, cs.AI and cs.LG are the most likely categories, as the paper focuses on deep reinforcement learning and policy inference. The use of raw observations and partial observability also suggests a potential connection to cs.CV and cs.RO."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
