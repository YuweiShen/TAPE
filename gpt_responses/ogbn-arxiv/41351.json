The use of interactive proofs and cloud computing also suggests a connection to the subfield of distributed computing (cs.DC). The paper specifically focuses on the problem of maximum matchings, which is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization (cs.CC) and graph theory (cs.DM). The use of linear maps and low-degree polynomial extensions suggests a connection to the subfield of information theory (cs.IT) and computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
