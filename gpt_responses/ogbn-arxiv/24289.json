The focus on symmetries and algebraic properties suggests a connection to computational complexity theory (cs.CC) and linear algebra (cs.DS). The use of tensors and geometric methods suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), and numerical analysis (cs.NA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
