The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) also suggests the machine learning (cs.MM) and deep learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The evaluation of the proposed method on a new dataset and comparison with a previous state-of-the-art method indicates the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Finally, the use of surveillance cameras for weather detection may also fall under the cryptography and security (cs.CR) sub-category, as it can be used for surveillance and monitoring purposes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
