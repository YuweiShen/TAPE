The use of multiuser MIMO communications is also a key aspect of the paper, which falls under the category of signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper also involves the analysis of association probabilities and comparison of different scenarios, which can be considered as a game-theoretic problem (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
