The paper also discusses interference-aware receiver technology, which is related to communication systems (cs.COMM) and signal processing (cs.SY). The proposed combining schemes for the IASD receiver may involve modulation techniques, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
