Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves signal processing and information theory, which suggests cs.IT (Information Theory) as the second likely category. The paper deals with interference and protection of a safety-of-life functionality, which could fall under cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Finally, the paper discusses the estimation of propagation loss, which could be related to cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
