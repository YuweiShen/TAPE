The focus on subpacketization and cache placement algorithms suggests a potential fit for distributed systems (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper's emphasis on achieving maximum degrees of freedom during transmission aligns with the goals of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
