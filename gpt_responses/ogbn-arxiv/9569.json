The proposed method uses device-integrated sensors and body-worn cameras to encode rich information on device usage and users' visual scene, which involves computer vision techniques (cs.CV) and multimedia processing (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the impact of different feature sets on performance, which relates to information retrieval (cs.IR) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
