The use of group structures in the design of frames suggests that the paper may also fall under computational geometry (cs.CG) and discrete structures (cs.DS). Finally, the mention of bounds and potential functions suggests that numerical analysis (cs.NA) may also be relevant."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
