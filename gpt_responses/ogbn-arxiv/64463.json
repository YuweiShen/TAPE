The paper also discusses the use of data augmentation schemes, which is a common technique in machine learning (cs.LG) to address the insufficient training data problem. The proposed framework, Multiple Instance Learning Convolutional Neural Networks (MILCNN), involves weakly supervised learning, which falls under the category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
