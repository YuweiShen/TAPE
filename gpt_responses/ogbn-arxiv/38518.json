The paper focuses on the specific problem of rendezvous, which is a fundamental task in MAS. The paper proposes an algorithm for fast rendezvous on a cycle by agents with different speeds, which involves the use of asynchrony phenomena. This topic is closely related to the sub-categories of Multi-Agent Systems (cs.MA), Distributed Computing (cs.DC), Distributed Systems (cs.DS), and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper deals with the problem of symmetry breaking, which is a common theme in the study of complex systems and control theory, and is related to the sub-category of Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
