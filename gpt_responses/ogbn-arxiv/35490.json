The method also involves the use of high-level decomposition and probabilistic analysis, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). The paper also mentions the use of simulations, which could fall under computer vision (cs.CV) or machine learning (cs.LG) if the simulations involve training or testing of models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
