The paper also discusses distributed algorithms for determining back-off rates, which falls under the distributed computing (cs.DC) sub-category. The use of conflict graphs and the mention of special cases such as line networks and acyclic conflict graphs suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the social and information networks (cs.SI) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with achieving target throughputs, which is a problem in optimization and algorithms, and may be relevant to the data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
