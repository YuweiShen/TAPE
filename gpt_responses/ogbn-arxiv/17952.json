This falls under the umbrella of information theory (cs.IT) and cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also involves algorithms and computational methods for constructing these codes, which could potentially fall under data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and systems and control (cs.SI). Finally, the paper uses a Gray map to establish an equivalence between codes over different rings, which could be considered a topic in logic and computation (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
