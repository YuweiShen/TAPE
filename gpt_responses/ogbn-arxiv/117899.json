The use of cognitive transmitters and the need for superposition encoding suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the networked intelligence (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The study of interference channels and capacity regions may also be relevant to the computer communications (cs.CC) sub-category. Finally, the mention of Gel'fand-Pinsker encoding suggests a possible connection to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
