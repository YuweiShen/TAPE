The paper discusses the fronthaul links that connect the remote radio heads (RRHs) to the baseband processing unit (BBU), which is a key aspect of the network architecture. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The paper discusses the optimization of the delivery rate under fronthaul capacity and per-eRRH power constraints. This involves designing efficient coding and transmission schemes, which is a key area of information theory. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper discusses the joint design of cloud and edge processing for F-RANs, which involves optimizing the overall system performance. This is a key area of systems and control. \n4. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper discusses the use of local caches in the enhanced RRHs (eRRHs) to store frequently requested contents. This is a key aspect of multimedia systems, which often involve caching and pre-fetching to improve performance. \n5. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The paper discusses the use of both centralized and local processing in the F-RAN, which involves distributed computing. The paper also discusses the use of a hybrid"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
