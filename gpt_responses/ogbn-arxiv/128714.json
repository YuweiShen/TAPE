The focus is on recovering block sparse signals, which is a topic of interest in machine learning (cs.LG) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). The paper also discusses the use of prior support information, which is relevant to the field of signal processing (cs.SP) and statistical inference (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
