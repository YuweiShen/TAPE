The study of extremal properties of graphs and algorithms for adding edges suggest that the paper may also belong to discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and graph theory (cs.GT). The use of planar point sets and connectivity also suggests that the paper may belong to data structures (cs.DS) and possibly social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
