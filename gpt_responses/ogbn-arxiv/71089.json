Specifically, it extends the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis to sparse sub-networks and evaluates their performance in object recognition tasks. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and computational linguistics (cs.CL). However, given the focus on deep neural networks and transfer learning, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
