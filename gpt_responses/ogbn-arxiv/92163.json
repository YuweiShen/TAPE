It also mentions verifying the integrity of the inference computation to ensure it has not been manipulated by an attacker, which is a key aspect of cryptography and security. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to the cs.LG (Machine Learning) sub-category as it deals with deep neural networks and their inference. \n\nThe cs.SY (Systems and Control) sub-category is also a possibility as the paper discusses the configuration of CheckNet to provide different levels of security depending on compute/communication budgets, which is related to system design and control. \n\nThe cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category is another possibility as the paper deals with deep neural networks, which are a key component of AI. \n\nFinally, the cs.SE (Software Engineering) sub-category is a possibility as the paper discusses a method for ensuring the integrity of software computations, which is related to software engineering."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
