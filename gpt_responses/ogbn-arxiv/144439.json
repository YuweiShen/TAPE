The algorithm proposed is a distributed one, which involves coordination among multiple users, making it relevant to the systems and control (cs.SY) category. The paper also deals with the issue of interference to primary users, which is a key concern in cognitive radio networks, making it relevant to the cryptography and security (cs.CR) category. Finally, the paper proposes an algorithm that optimally uses past observations, which involves the use of machine learning and optimization (cs.AI) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
