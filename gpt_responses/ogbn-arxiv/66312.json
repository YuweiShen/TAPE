Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also focuses on object, scene, and face recognition problems, which are related to computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper proposes to perform online hyperparameter selection, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
