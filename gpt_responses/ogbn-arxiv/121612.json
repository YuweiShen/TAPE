It may also belong to the signal processing (cs.SD) sub-category as it deals with processing speech signals. Additionally, it involves natural language processing (cs.CL) as it aims to capture speech content. The use of deep learning and mutual information maximization also suggests it could belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the evaluation on large-scale benchmarks suggests it could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
