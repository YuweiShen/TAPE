This involves techniques from computer vision (CV) such as Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS), as well as graphics (GR) for surface meshing and rendering. The use of ray casting and 3D tetrahedralization (3DT) suggests a focus on robotics (RO) and computational geometry (CG). Finally, the data reduction techniques mentioned in the abstract could involve machine learning (LG) or multimedia (MM) methods. Overall, the paper seems to span multiple sub-fields of computer science, but the most relevant ones are likely to be CV and GR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
