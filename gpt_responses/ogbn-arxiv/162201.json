This involves the use of wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) and machine learning algorithms for gesture recognition. Therefore, the most likely category is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), which deals with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of machine learning algorithms, specifically support vector machines (SVM) and random forests, for gesture recognition. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) category, which deals with the study of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of computer vision techniques, specifically recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), for identifying the start of a gesture. This suggests that the paper could also belong to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) category, which deals with the study of algorithms and models for image and video analysis. \n\nThe paper also involves the use of signal processing techniques, specifically nonlinear time-series analysis, for identifying the start of a gesture.
