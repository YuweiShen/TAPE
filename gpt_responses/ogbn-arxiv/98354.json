The paper also discusses the use of algorithms to find an optimal transfer map, which is a machine learning problem (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the properties of the optimal transfer map, which is a systems theory problem (cs.SY). The paper also discusses the use of regressors, which is a topic related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses an example of transfer learning between quadrotor platforms, which is a topic related to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
