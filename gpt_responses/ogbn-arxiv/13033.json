The method involves computing reachable sets and collision-avoidance constraints, which also relates to control systems (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The optimization aspect of the method could also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
