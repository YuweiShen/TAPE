This involves identifying critical features that determine an individual patient's severity of illness. The paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper involves the development of an attribution method for interpreting a machine learning model, specifically an RNN. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper involves the use of machine learning techniques to predict ICU mortality using electronic medical records. \n- cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper involves the use of computational techniques to analyze and interpret medical data. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The paper involves the use of a neural network model, specifically an RNN, to predict ICU mortality. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper involves the interpretation of machine learning predictions in the context of clinical intuition and disease trajectories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
