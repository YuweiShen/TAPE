This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Systems and Control sub-category.\n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper presents the implementation and verification of the proposed controller for the inverted pendulum and three degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) helicopter, which are examples of robotic systems. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics sub-category.\n- cs.EM (Emerging Technologies): The paper proposes a novel approach to design controller that allows the use of complex, unverified controllers (e.g., neural networks) that drive the physical systems towards complex specifications. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Emerging Technologies sub-category.\n- cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions the injection of various types of faults in applications and in the underlying real-time operating system (RTOS) to verify the safety of the system, which suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Cryptography and Security sub-category.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper mentions the use of complex, unverified controllers (e.g., neural networks) that drive the physical"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
