The method proposed is adaptive and runs in constant time per letter, which suggests that it could be relevant to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also presents a theoretical analysis of the method's performance, which could be of interest to the machine learning and statistics community (cs.LG). Probability estimation is also relevant to cryptography and security (cs.CR) and signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
