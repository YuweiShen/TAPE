The approach used in the paper is based on a continuous version of the operator scaling algorithm, which is a technique used in optimization and numerical analysis. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.OT (Optimization and Control). However, the paper also involves techniques from numerical analysis (cs.NA), information theory (cs.IT), machine learning (cs.LG), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
