The paper also proposes methods for handling noise in the rewards and dynamics of the environment, which is a common problem in robotics and control applications (cs.RO, cs.SY). Finally, the paper uses regularized regression-based gradient estimation, which is a common technique in neural network optimization (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
