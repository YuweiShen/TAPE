Therefore, cs.IR and cs.CL are the most likely sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses neural-based techniques, which are commonly used in computer vision (CV) and deep learning (DL) research, making cs.CV and cs.DL also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a new domain-specific data set, which could be of interest to researchers in machine learning (LG) who work on data set creation and evaluation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
