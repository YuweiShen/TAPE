The paper focuses on measuring network activation entropy to select data for unsupervised model adaptation. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.SD (Sound), followed by cs.CL (Computation and Language), as the paper deals with speech recognition tasks. The paper also deals with machine learning algorithms, which makes cs.LG (Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper proposes a method to estimate the propagation of distortion in a fully connected network, which makes cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
