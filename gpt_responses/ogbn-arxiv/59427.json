Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses energy-efficient implementation, which suggests that it could belong to cs.SD (Systems and Control) or cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing). The use of deep learning neural networks also suggests that it could belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
