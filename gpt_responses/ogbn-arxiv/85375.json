The use of proof of work (PoW) is also a common technique in blockchain and cryptocurrency research, which falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The paper also introduces a structure for a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which is a data structure commonly used in graph theory and algorithms research (cs.DS). The use of mempool transaction assignment is related to network protocols and communication systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper's focus on scalability and decentralization aligns with the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
