The paper also discusses optimization techniques, which could place it in cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). The use of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations suggests cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper's focus on global solvers and inference methods could place it in cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
