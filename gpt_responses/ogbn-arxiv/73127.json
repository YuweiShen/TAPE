This topic falls under the broad category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) as it involves developing a model to evaluate trust. The use of search engines to compute the normalized similarity score (NSS) method suggests that the paper may also belong to the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. The paper also discusses the use of ontology trees, which is a common approach in natural language processing (cs.CL) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
