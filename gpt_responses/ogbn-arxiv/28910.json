The study of visual complexity of drawings is also related to graph drawing (cs.GR). The use of lower and upper bounds suggests a connection to algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper's focus on planar graphs and cubic graphs suggests a possible application in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for problems involving spatial reasoning and graph representation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
