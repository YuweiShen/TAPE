The paper also makes use of type theory and category theory, which are subfields of theoretical computer science (cs.TL) and programming languages (cs.PL). The paper's focus on intensional fixed points and abstract analogues of classic intensional results suggests a connection to computability theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper's use of exposures as a framework for studying intensionality may also be relevant to machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
