The paper discusses the design of a geographical scheduling algorithm for multicast precoding, which involves the optimization of resource allocation and transmission scheduling, and can be applied to various CS sub-fields. Therefore, the most likely categories are cs.IT and cs.NI, followed by cs.COMM, cs.SY, and cs.DC."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
