These applications are commonly studied in the computer vision (cs.CV) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of algorithms for these applications, which falls under the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Additionally, the paper focuses on the use of Near Infra-Red (NIR) illumination, which is a topic of interest in the information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-category. Lastly, the paper discusses the creation of a valuable resource for development and evaluation of algorithms, which falls under the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
