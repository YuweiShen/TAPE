This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of policies based on perceptual inputs and hidden belief states suggests a potential connection to computer vision (cs.CV) as well. The fact that the agents are reactive and the use of recurrent neural networks suggests a potential connection to robotics (cs.RO) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
