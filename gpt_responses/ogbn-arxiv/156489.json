The paper also introduces a new technique for variance reduction, which is a common problem in machine learning (cs.LG). The game being studied is no-limit Texas hold'em poker, which falls under the category of game theory (cs.GT). The paper also discusses the use of heuristics, which is a common topic in cryptography (cs.CR). Finally, the paper deals with the explicit strategy of a subset of agents, which falls under the category of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
