The use of deep learning models also suggests that it could belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The fact that the imagery is remotely sensed suggests that it could also belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the use of feedback loops and intermediate supervision suggests that it could belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
