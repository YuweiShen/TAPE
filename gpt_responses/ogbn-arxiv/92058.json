The paper proposes a new QUIC transport parameter, which involves modifying the protocol itself, making it relevant to the category of cryptography and security (cs.CR). The paper also evaluates the performance benefits of the proposed solution, which involves measuring the delay overhead, making it relevant to the category of distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC). Additionally, the paper involves software engineering aspects, such as introducing a new parameter to the protocol, which falls under the category of software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the paper involves evaluating the performance of the proposed solution, which involves measuring the delay overhead, making it relevant to the category of programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
