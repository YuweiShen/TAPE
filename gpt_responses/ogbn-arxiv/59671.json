The library is designed to simplify the process of implementing and testing novel RL methodologies. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). Additionally, the library can be used for system control (cs.SY) and neural networks (cs.NE) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
