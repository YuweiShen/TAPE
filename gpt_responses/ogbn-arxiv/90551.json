The paper presents a three-stage pipeline for the implementation of the weed classification system, consisting of initial field surveillance, offline processing and selective labelling, and automated precision weeding. The key characteristic of the approach is the combination of plant clustering and selective labelling, which enables the system to operate without prior weed species knowledge. Given the focus on computer vision and machine learning techniques for weed classification, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also deals with robotics and automation for precision weeding, which suggests the possibility of cs.RO (Robotics) as a second likely sub-category. The use of machine learning algorithms for classification and labelling also suggests the possibility of cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with the processing of large amounts of data, which suggests the possibility of cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as a less likely but still possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
