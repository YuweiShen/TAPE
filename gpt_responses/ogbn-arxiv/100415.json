The paper proposes a new framework for training and exploration in multi-agent systems, which involves centralized training and decentralized execution via policy distillation. This framework is based on deep reinforcement learning and maximum-entropy learning techniques. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). Additionally, the paper also involves robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY) since it deals with coordinating the actions of multiple agents in a complex environment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
