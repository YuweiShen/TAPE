The paper proposes a new method for estimating the class prior using only positive samples, which is a novel approach. This paper is likely to be submitted to the machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), statistics (cs.ST), and information theory (cs.IT) sub-categories of arXiv CS, as these sub-categories are closely related to the problem addressed in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
