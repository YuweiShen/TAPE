The paper focuses on obtaining decentralized policies for agents to maximize the performance of a collaborative task, which is similar to solving a decentralized Markov decision process. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). Additionally, the paper proposes using generative cooperative policy networks (GCPN) to generate action samples to make other agents improve their objectives during the training period, which is related to robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
