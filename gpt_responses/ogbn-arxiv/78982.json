This suggests a focus on machine learning techniques for teaching classification rules. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper addresses challenges in data-driven online education, which is a subfield of AI. The proposed algorithm for selecting examples to teach to workers also involves decision-making and optimization, which are common topics in AI. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper is motivated by challenges in crowdsourcing labeling tasks, which involves human-computer interaction. The proposed algorithm aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of teaching workers, which is relevant to HCI. \n- cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper mentions image annotation tasks, which may involve natural language processing techniques for generating labels or instructions for workers. \n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper addresses issues related to crowdsourcing and online education, which have implications for the social and ethical aspects of computing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
