The paper also proposes a novel adaptation of Information Flow Control (IFC) techniques, which involves the design of system tools and infrastructure, indicating a potential fit for distributed, parallel, and cloud computing (cs.DC). The paper also discusses the construction of timing-hardened cloud infrastructure, which involves software engineering and programming language design (cs.SE) and potentially programming language theory (cs.PL). Finally, the paper discusses the use of TIFC to control the flow of sensitive information through systems, which may involve control systems and cyber-physical systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
