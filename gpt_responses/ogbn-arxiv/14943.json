The use of dynamic programming and optimization techniques also suggests a strong connection to information theory. \n2. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The problem of detecting changes in a system is a classic problem in systems and control, and the paper proposes solutions for both centralized and decentralized settings. \n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning) - The use of dynamic programming and optimization techniques can also be seen as a form of machine learning, and the paper proposes low-complexity solutions based on online estimation of the change propagation pattern. \n4. cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) - The decentralized setting of the problem involves multiple agents (sensors) that need to coordinate their actions to detect changes in the system. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) - The paper proposes a novel sampling and transmission scheme for the decentralized setting that improves detection performance using the same amount of communication resources. This suggests a connection to networking and internet architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
