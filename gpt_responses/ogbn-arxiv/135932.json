The paper specifically focuses on the Multiplicative Additive Linear Logic (MALL) and introduces a new parametrized construction of a GoI for MALL. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). \n\nThe paper also deals with directed weighted graphs, which are a topic in graph theory and algorithms, and introduces a notion of observational equivalence, which is a topic in programming languages and semantics. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). \n\nThe paper also discusses adjunctions, which are a topic in category theory and mathematical logic, and relates its construction to Girard's various constructions, which is a topic in proof theory and theoretical computer science. Therefore, it is also likely to belong to cs.CC (Computational Complexity) and cs.GR (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
