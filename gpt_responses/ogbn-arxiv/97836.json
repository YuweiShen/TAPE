The paper proposes a novel AutoML scheme by leveraging the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which is a popular optimization technique in machine learning. Therefore, the most likely sub-category for this paper is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper deals with optimization problems involving mixed integer and continuous variables, which is a common problem in the field of optimization and could also place it in the sub-categories of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.SE (Software Engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
