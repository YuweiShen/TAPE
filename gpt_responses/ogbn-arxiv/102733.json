The paper also discusses the use of advice in randomness extraction, which is a topic studied in cryptography (cs.CR). The use of Kolmogorov extractors as the main technical device suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-categories of data structures (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
