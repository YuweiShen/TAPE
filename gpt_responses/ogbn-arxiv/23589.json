The paper also uses finite geometry in combinatorics to obtain BEC-optimal parity-check matrices, which falls under computational geometry (cs.CG). Additionally, the paper discusses stopping sets and stopping set distributions, which are related to the structure of the code and its parity-check matrix, and can be studied using graph theory and combinatorics (cs.CC, cs.DS). Finally, the paper proposes an optimal decoder with lower decoding complexity, which is a topic in signal processing and machine learning (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
