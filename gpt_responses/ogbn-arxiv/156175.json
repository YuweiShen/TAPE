This falls under the category of distributed computing (cs.DC) and machine learning (cs.LG). The specific application of the system is for deep convolutional neural networks (deep CNNs) learning, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL). Additionally, the paper mentions the development of new distribution algorithms, which falls under neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
