The use of deep contextualized embeddings and sequence labeling techniques are also common in NLP research. Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves information retrieval (IR) techniques, as keyphrase extraction is a sub-task of IR. This suggests cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as another likely sub-category. The use of machine learning models such as BiLSTM-CRF and BERT also suggests cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as possible sub-categories. Finally, the paper's focus on embeddings and self-attention layers suggests cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
