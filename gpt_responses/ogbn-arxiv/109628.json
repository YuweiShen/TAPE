The paper proposes a system that uses kernel audits and graph pattern matching to uncover the steps of a successful attack campaign, which involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. The system also involves software engineering (cs.SE) principles for designing and implementing the system, as well as data structures (cs.DS) for representing and manipulating the graphs. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CR, followed by cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.SE, and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
