The connection to the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, which is a popular graph isomorphism testing algorithm, suggests that the paper may also be relevant to algorithms and complexity in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the use of hardness condensation, a technique from proof complexity, suggests that the paper may also be relevant to discrete mathematics (cs.DM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
