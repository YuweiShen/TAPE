The paper also discusses the use of distributed training, which is a common topic in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of physics engines and simulations is also relevant to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper mentions locomotion tasks, which could involve computer vision techniques for perception and tracking (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
