This falls under the category of computer security (cs.CR). The paper also presents an operational semantics and a formal definition of constant-time programs in the presence of speculative and out-of-order execution, which falls under programming languages (cs.PL) and computer architecture (cs.AR). The paper also discusses the relevance of their semantics in the context of Spectre-like attacks, which falls under software engineering (cs.SE) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
