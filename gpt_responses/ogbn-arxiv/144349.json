The use of $\\ell_1$-synthesis and $\\ell_1$-analysis models is also a common approach in these fields. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.SP (Signal Processing), and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also mentions the use of dictionary atoms, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
