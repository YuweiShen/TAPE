This is a classic topic in discrete mathematics, and the paper's focus on proving theorems in this area makes cs.DM a likely sub-category.\n2. cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper's focus on words and their properties, including overlaps and split occurrences, is a classic topic in formal languages and automata theory. The paper's use of theorems and proofs also suggests a formal approach, making cs.FL a likely sub-category.\n3. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper's focus on overlaps and repeated disjoint occurrences in words could be seen as related to information theory, which deals with the transmission and processing of information. The paper's use of theorems and proofs also suggests a mathematical approach, making cs.IT a possible sub-category.\n4. cs.CC (Computational Complexity): The paper's focus on the properties of words and their overlaps could be seen as related to computational complexity, which deals with the efficiency of algorithms and the difficulty of solving problems. The paper's use of theorems and proofs also suggests a mathematical approach, making cs.CC a possible sub-category.\n5. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper's focus on the properties"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
