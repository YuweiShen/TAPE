The paper also discusses the use of class priors and regularization, which are techniques commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its approach on large-scale benchmarks, which is a common practice in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
