The method involves using a graph Laplacian to encourage smooth activations on a predetermined or learned graph. This technique is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), neural networks (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
