This makes it likely to belong to the Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper discusses the complexity of the extended system, which suggests it could also belong to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category. The use of additive connectives and the encoding of a logical system into a computational model also make it possible for the paper to belong to the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category. The paper's discussion of the nondeterministic extension of Light Linear Logic and its complexity could also place it in the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. Finally, the paper's use of logic and computational models could make it relevant to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
