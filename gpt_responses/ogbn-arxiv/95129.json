The paper also presents a theory for constructing these networks using differential expressions, which involves mathematical modeling and computation (cs.NE). The paper discusses the properties of the resulting network, including scale and rotation covariance, which are important topics in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI).
