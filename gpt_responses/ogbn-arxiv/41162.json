This falls under the category of multi-agent systems (cs.MA) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper also discusses the decomposition of global specifications into subtasks, which involves the use of algorithms and control design, making it relevant to the categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper presents a cooperative control scenario for a team of robots, which is related to the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
