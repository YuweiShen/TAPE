This topic is closely related to programming languages (cs.PL) and databases (cs.DB), as well as machine learning (cs.LG) and software engineering (cs.SE) since provenance information can be used to improve software quality and machine learning models. Additionally, the paper discusses the correctness properties of the proposed approach, which is related to cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
