The use of integrals of rational functions suggests a connection to symbolic computation and algorithmic techniques, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.SC (Symbolic Computation) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The study of multiple binomial sums also involves combinatorial and algebraic structures, which are relevant to sub-categories such as cs.CA (Combinatorics and Discrete Mathematics) and cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). Finally, the mention of geometric simplifications suggests a connection to computational geometry and topology, which are relevant to sub-category cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
