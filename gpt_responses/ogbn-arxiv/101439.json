Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves analysis and simulations, which could fall under cs.IT (Information Theory) and cs.PF (Performance). The proposed solutions to the late-comer problem involve control systems and optimization, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) and cs.MM (Multimedia)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
