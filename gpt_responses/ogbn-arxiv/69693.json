The approach integrates multiple measurements and takes system topology into account. The paper also compares the proposed approach with other widely-used machine learning schemes. \n2. cs.SI (Systems and Control): The paper deals with fault location in power distribution systems, which is a problem in systems and control. The proposed approach takes system topology into account and integrates multiple measurements to locate faults. \n3. cs.SY (Systems and Control): Similar to cs.SI, the paper deals with fault location in power distribution systems, which is a problem in systems and control. The proposed approach takes system topology into account and integrates multiple measurements to locate faults. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes a novel graph convolutional network (GCN) framework for fault location in power distribution networks. The approach integrates multiple measurements and takes system topology into account.
