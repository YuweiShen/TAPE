The paper also mentions that the watermarking scheme works for general classification tasks (cs.LG) and can be combined with current learning algorithms. The experiments conducted in the paper involve image classification tasks (cs.CV), which further supports the likelihood of these sub-categories. Additionally, the paper deals with the intellectual property of pre-trained models, which is related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and distributed computing (cs.DC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
