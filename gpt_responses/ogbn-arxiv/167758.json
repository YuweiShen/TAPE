The paper proposes a novel method for supervising convolutional neural networks, which involves end-to-end learning for joint detection and grouping. This suggests that the paper may also be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
