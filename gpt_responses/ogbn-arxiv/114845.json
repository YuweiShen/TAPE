The use of semialgebraic sets and polynomial optimization also suggests a connection to algebraic geometry (cs.AG) and computational geometry (cs.CG). The mention of non-uniformly deterministic and uniformly probabilistic algorithms suggests a connection to randomized algorithms (cs.DS) and probabilistic analysis (cs.DM). Finally, the mention of system degree and intrinsic complexity suggests a connection to complexity theory and computational complexity (cs.CC, cs.SC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
