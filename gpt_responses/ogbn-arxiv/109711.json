It also discusses the difficulty of learning from and transferring to fine-grained datasets, which are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of distance functions, which are commonly used in natural language processing (cs.CL). Finally, the paper discusses the vulnerability of fine-grained datasets to adversarial attacks, which is a topic in computer security (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
