The paper proposes a novel and efficient stochastic regression approach with latent drop-out codes that combines the merits of both lines of research. The paper also discusses a new training objective that increases coverage of the training distribution leading to improvements over the state of the art in terms of accuracy as well as diversity. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
