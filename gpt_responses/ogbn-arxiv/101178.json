The use of cooperative NOMA (CNOMA) also involves system-level considerations (cs.SY). The analysis of outage probabilities is a key performance metric in communication systems, which falls under the category of communication theory (cs.COMM). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to multimedia communication (cs.MM) as it discusses the transmission of massive data in wireless networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
