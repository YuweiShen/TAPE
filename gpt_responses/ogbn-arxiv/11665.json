The tool is also integrated with related program transformations such as size abstractions and query-answer transformation, which relates to software engineering (cs.SE). The experiments conducted using the tool involve transition systems arising from models of embedded systems (cs.EM) and an emulator for a PIC microcontroller used in wearable computing systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
