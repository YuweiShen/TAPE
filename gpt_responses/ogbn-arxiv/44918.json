The paper reviews the relevant literature and forms a typology of these new techniques. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are: \n\n- cs.CY (Computers and Society): This sub-category deals with the social and ethical aspects of computing, including the impact of technology on society. The paper's focus on the use of crowdsourcing for collective intelligence fits well within this sub-category. \n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This sub-category deals with the analysis and modeling of social networks and other forms of information networks. The paper's discussion of new forms of organization for IT-mediated crowds fits within this sub-category. \n- cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): This sub-category deals with the design and evaluation of interactive systems for human use. The paper's discussion of new configurations of hardware, software, and people in next generation crowdsourcing fits within this sub-category. \n- cs.IR (Information Retrieval): This sub-category deals with the retrieval and analysis of information from large datasets. The paper's discussion of crowdsourcing techniques for collective intelligence purposes may involve the analysis of large datasets, making this sub-category relevant. \n- cs.SD (Software Engineering): This sub-category deals with the design"}, "finish_reason": "length", "index": 0}]}
