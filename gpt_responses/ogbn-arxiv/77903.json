The use of wireless devices and signal passing through walls suggests that the paper may also be related to information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). The complexity analysis of the problem and the use of combinatorial techniques suggest that the paper may also be related to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and theoretical computer science (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
