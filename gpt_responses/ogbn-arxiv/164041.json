It is also likely to belong to the cs.IR (Information Retrieval) sub-category as it addresses the problem of ranking metrics, which is a key component of information retrieval systems. Additionally, the paper mentions that the framework applies to any scale-free discrete loss function, which suggests that it could also be relevant to the cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-categories. Finally, the paper is implemented as a part of the CatBoost gradient boosting library, which suggests that it could also be relevant to the cs.CL (Computation and Language) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
