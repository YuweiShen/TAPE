This involves placing evidential priors over a Gaussian likelihood function and training the neural network to infer the hyperparameters of the evidential distribution. The paper applies this method to various benchmarks and computer vision tasks, indicating a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV). Additionally, the paper emphasizes the importance of calibrated and robust measures of uncertainty in safety-critical domains, suggesting a potential connection to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper's use of neural networks and probabilistic modeling aligns with the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
