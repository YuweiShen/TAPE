Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also addresses challenges related to limited hardware and communication capabilities, which could fall under the sub-category of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC). The proposed method involves balancing child nodes and reducing network congestion, which could fall under the sub-category of Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS). The paper also proposes a dynamic data aggregation approach using learning automata, which could fall under the sub-category of Machine Learning (cs.LG) or Systems and Control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
