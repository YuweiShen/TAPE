The problem also involves network information theory (cs.NI) as it deals with the transmission of information over a network. The use of side information and coding gain suggests that the paper may also be relevant to source coding and channel coding, which fall under the categories of signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
