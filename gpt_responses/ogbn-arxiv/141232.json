However, the paper focuses on the theoretical aspects of these problems, such as proving NP-hardness and developing algorithms, which are more closely related to discrete mathematics (cs.DM), computational geometry (cs.CG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), graph theory (cs.GT), and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
