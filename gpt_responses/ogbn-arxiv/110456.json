This involves selecting relevant objects and computing a distribution over their properties in the resulting state. The paper also discusses the use of a simulated domain in which a robot pushes stacks of objects on a cluttered table. Based on these factors, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and computer vision (cs.CV) to some extent, which are also likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
