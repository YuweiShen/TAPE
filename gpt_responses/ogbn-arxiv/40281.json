The use of MMSE receiver and the consideration of channel estimation error and quantizer noise suggest that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The focus on the number of BS antennas and its impact on the achievable rate indicates that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of simulations to validate the results suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of computer communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
