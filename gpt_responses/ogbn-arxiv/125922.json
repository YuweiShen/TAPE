This involves machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (cs.AI), as well as database management (cs.DB) and human-computer interaction (cs.HC). The paper also discusses the evaluation of the proposed framework through a survey (cs.CR). The use of machine learning and crowdsourcing techniques suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
