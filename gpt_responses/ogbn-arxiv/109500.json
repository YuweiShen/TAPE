This problem is closely related to the field of robotics (cs.RO) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of submodularity, which is a concept commonly used in machine learning (cs.LG) and computer vision (cs.CV). Finally, the paper presents simulation results and experiments on a robot, indicating a focus on systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
