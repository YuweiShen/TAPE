Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) which deals with NLP and MT. The paper also involves the use of automatic metrics for evaluation, which suggests the sub-categories of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of different MT systems and evaluation approaches also indicates the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval). Finally, the paper involves the evaluation of language translation, which suggests the sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as neural networks are commonly used in MT."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
