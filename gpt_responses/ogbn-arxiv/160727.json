It also proposes a novel framework for cross-modal message passing to fuse the two-stream network. The paper also involves machine learning techniques such as classification and competing objectives, which are commonly used in the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Additionally, the paper involves multimedia (cs.MM) as it deals with processing and fusing information from multiple modalities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
