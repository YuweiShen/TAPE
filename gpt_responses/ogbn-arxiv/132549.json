The paper also discusses the use of Toeplitz STBC for achieving full diversity, which involves matrix algebra and linear algebra techniques that are commonly studied in the signal processing (cs.SI) and networking (cs.NI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the use of quadratic-amplitude modulation (QAM) and maximum-likelihood (ML) detection, which are topics that are relevant to machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
