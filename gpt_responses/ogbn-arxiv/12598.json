The use of sparse matrices in the coding scheme suggests a potential application in network coding (cs.NI) and sparse signal processing (cs.SI). The iterative decoding scheme mentioned in the abstract is a common technique in distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the implementation considerations mentioned in the abstract suggest a potential application in computer communications (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
