This involves modeling the locations of users and base stations using Poisson point processes (PPPs) and Poisson cluster processes (PCPs). The paper also mentions the third generation partnership project (3GPP) simulation models for HetNets. Based on this information, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are:\n\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): This sub-category covers the mathematical foundations of information theory, including stochastic processes and random variables. The paper's use of PPPs and PCPs for modeling HetNets falls under this category.\n- cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): This sub-category covers the design, analysis, and optimization of computer networks and communication systems. The paper's focus on downlink coverage probability in HetNets is relevant to this category.\n- cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): This sub-category covers the study of social networks and other large-scale information networks. While the paper does not explicitly mention social networks, the use of stochastic geometry to model HetNets is relevant to this category.\n- cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): This sub-category covers the study of systems composed of multiple interacting agents.
