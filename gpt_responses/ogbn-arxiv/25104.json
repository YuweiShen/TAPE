The methods proposed involve training the agent to design and execute interventions to discover the true causal model, which relates to the sub-category of machine learning (LG) and robotics (RO). The paper also discusses the difficulty of spurious correlations in causal models, which relates to the sub-category of computer vision and pattern recognition (CE). Finally, the paper proposes a method for improving the causal graph, which relates to the sub-category of systems and control (SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
