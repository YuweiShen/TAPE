The paper discusses the challenges of directly applying reinforcement learning to MAD due to medical ethics concerns and proposes a propensity-based patient simulator (PBPS) that generates informative counterfactual answers along with the disease diagnosis. The paper also introduces a progressive assurance agent (P2A) that is trained with PBPS. Based on this description, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (artificial intelligence), cs.LG (machine learning), cs.CL (computation and language), cs.CY (computers and society), and cs.HC (human-computer interaction)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
