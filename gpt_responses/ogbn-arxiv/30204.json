Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of state-of-the-art methods to detect and recognize text instances, which involves machine learning and deep learning techniques, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) and cs.CL (Computation and Language) likely sub-categories as well. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of evaluation protocols and results summaries, which suggests a focus on experimental analysis and statistical methods, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) possible sub-categories too."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
