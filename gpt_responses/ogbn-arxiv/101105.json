The method involves extracting depth rankings of human joints from images using a Pairwise Ranking Convolutional Neural Network (PRCNN) and then using a coarse-to-fine 3D Pose Network (DPNet) to estimate 3D poses from both depth rankings and 2D human joint locations. The paper is likely to belong to the Computer Vision (cs.CV) sub-category as it deals with image processing and feature extraction. It may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories as it involves the use of deep neural networks. Additionally, it may belong to the Graphics (cs.GR) and Multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories as it deals with 3D pose estimation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
