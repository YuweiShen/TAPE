The use of binary codes and hash tables also suggests a connection to Computer Vision (cs.CV) and Data Structures (cs.DS). The proposed multi-index hashing approach and the evaluation of performance on real-world datasets are also relevant to the sub-categories of Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
