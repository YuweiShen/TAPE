Other likely sub-categories include cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as the paper deals with the challenges of handling non-IID data in distributed systems. Additionally, cs.CV (Computer Vision) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) are also possible sub-categories as the experiments were conducted on image datasets and the proposed algorithm involves optimization methods commonly used in neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
