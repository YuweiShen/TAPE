The paper also proposes a low-rank optimization approach to maximize achievable degrees-of-freedom, which is a common technique in machine learning and optimization (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of network connectivity information to manage interferences, which is a topic in network science and networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also proposes Riemannian optimization algorithms, which is a subfield of optimization and geometry (cs.SI). Finally, the paper deals with system performance improvement, which is a topic in control and systems engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
