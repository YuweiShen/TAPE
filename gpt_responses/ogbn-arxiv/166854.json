This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) and Product Line (cs.PL) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper focuses on embedded software systems, such as automotive, robotic or automation systems, which suggests that it may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) and Robotics (cs.RO) sub-categories.
