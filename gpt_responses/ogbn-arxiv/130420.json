This falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The experiments are conducted on image and sound classification datasets, which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) could also be relevant sub-categories. Additionally, the use of regularization parameters and optimization techniques indicates artificial intelligence (cs.AI) could also be a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
