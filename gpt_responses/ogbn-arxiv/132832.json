This suggests that the paper could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper focuses on the MapReduce framework, which is a popular distributed computing paradigm, indicating that it could also belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category.
