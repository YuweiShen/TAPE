Therefore, cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves capturing images using machine vision cameras, which falls under cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.MM (Multimedia). The paper proposes a novel blur decomposition strategy, which involves recursive splitting of the long exposure image, which could be related to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
