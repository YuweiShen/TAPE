The proposed framework involves designing a parametric vectorization layer and making use of normalization techniques, which are common in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The experiments involve benchmark recognition datasets, which are typically used in multimedia (cs.MM) and neural networks (cs.NE) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
