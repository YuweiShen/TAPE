This involves feature extraction based on the angles between edge vectors and orthogonal bases, which is relevant to computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also discusses the importance of modeling local structure and geometric relationships among points, which is relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and geometric modeling (cs.GR) research. Finally, the proposed method involves training a neural network to preserve geometric structure in Euclidean space, which is relevant to neural networks (cs.NE) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
