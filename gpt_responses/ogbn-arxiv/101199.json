The method is designed to improve the efficiency of CNNs, which is also relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also evaluates the proposed method on popular CNN architectures, which is related to computational linguistics (cs.CL) as CNNs are commonly used in natural language processing tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
