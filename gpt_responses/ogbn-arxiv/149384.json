This falls under the domain of information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM). The use of feedback links and the optimization of the number of users selected also suggest relevance to the sub-categories of signal processing (cs.SI), networking and internet architecture (cs.NI), and multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
