The paper specifically focuses on the use of autoencoders, which are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning, and their ensemble for efficient online detection of network attacks. This suggests that the paper could also fall under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Additionally, the paper discusses the feature extraction framework used to track network patterns, which could also place it under the category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
