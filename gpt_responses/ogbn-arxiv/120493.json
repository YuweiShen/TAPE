The investigation of high-SNR capacity also involves system-level analysis and optimization, which falls under the category of systems and control (cs.SY). The use of local oscillators and phase noise also relates to networked systems and networking (cs.NI). Finally, the paper may also be relevant to multimedia systems and applications (cs.MM) as multiple antennas are often used in wireless multimedia communication."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
