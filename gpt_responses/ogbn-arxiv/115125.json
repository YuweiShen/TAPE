The focus on learning to switch control between machines and humans suggests cs.HC as another likely category. The use of upper confidence bounds and regret analysis suggests cs.LG as a possible category. Finally, the application of the proposed algorithms in autonomous driving systems suggests cs.SY as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
