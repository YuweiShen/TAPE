The paper also uses tools from dynamical systems analysis, which is a subfield of machine learning (cs.LG) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper's focus on interpreting the workings of recurrent networks also falls under the category of explainable AI (cs.AI). Finally, the paper's use of fixed points and linearized dynamics is a common technique in control theory (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
