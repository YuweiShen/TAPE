The focus on edge computing and minimizing latency suggests a potential fit for distributed, parallel, and cluster computing (cs.DC) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NE). The proposed framework also involves adapting to different network conditions, which could fall under control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
