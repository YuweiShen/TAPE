The use of cardinality constraints is a key aspect of the paper, which could also be relevant to the logic (cs.LO) and programming languages (cs.PL) subfields. Finally, the paper presents experimental results on the performance of the proposed algorithms, which could be of interest to the data mining (cs.DM) subfield."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
