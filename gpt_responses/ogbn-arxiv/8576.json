The paper proposes a new method for estimating gradients, called randomized telescope (RT) gradient estimators, which can provide cheap unbiased gradient estimates. The paper evaluates the proposed method on a range of applications including meta-optimization of learning rates, variational inference of ODE parameters, and training an LSTM to model long sequences. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.SY (Systems and Control), and cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
