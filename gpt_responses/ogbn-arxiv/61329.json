The paper also discusses the tradeoff between storage and bandwidth, which is a common topic in distributed systems (cs.DS). The application of regenerating codes in network storage systems requires communication networks (cs.NI) and the paper also discusses the scalability of the approach, which is relevant to systems integration (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
