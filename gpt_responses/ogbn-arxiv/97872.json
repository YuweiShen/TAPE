This topic falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) categories. The paper also involves designing achievable schemes and analyzing the achievable degrees-of-freedom (DoF) region, which falls under the signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM) categories.
