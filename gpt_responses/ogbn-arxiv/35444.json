It also involves the design of computationally-efficient auctions (cs.DS) and the use of approximation algorithms (cs.AI). The concept of social welfare is central to the paper, which is a topic in economics and algorithmic game theory (cs.EC). Finally, the paper also involves information theory, as it discusses the dependence of the allocation on the units in which the valuations are measured (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
