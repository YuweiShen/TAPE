Additionally, the use of BERT language model is a popular technique in this field. \n\nIt could also belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the paper proposes a new model for joint entity and relation extraction, which involves machine learning techniques. \n\ncs.LG (Machine Learning) is another likely sub-category as the paper discusses the feature extraction ability of the bidirectional long short term memory network and the dynamic range attention mechanism, which are both machine learning techniques. \n\ncs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a possible sub-category as the paper uses a neural network model for joint entity and relation extraction. \n\nFinally, cs.IR (Information Retrieval) is a less likely sub-category as the paper deals with extracting structured information from medical text, which is a form of information retrieval."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
