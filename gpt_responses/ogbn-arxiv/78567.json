The paper also proposes a new approach to spatial smoothing, which involves adapting the degree of smoothing required for each brain volume, which could fall under neural networks (cs.NE) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates the approach on real fMRI data, which could involve natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques for analyzing the results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
