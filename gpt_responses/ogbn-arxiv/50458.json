This topic is closely related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, which are covered under cs.LG and cs.AI. The use of genetic algorithms to find the optimal ensemble also falls under the category of neural networks and evolutionary computing, which are covered under cs.NE. The paper also deals with classification accuracy, which is a common metric used in computer vision, covered under cs.CV. Finally, the paper deals with decision support, which is a topic covered under cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
