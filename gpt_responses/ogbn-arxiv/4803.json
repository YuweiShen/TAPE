The paper specifically focuses on the use of ontologies to improve the understandability of interpretable machine learning models, such as decision trees. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper presents the results of a user study that measures the understandability of decision trees in domains where explanations are critical, namely, in finance and medicine, which suggests that the paper could also be relevant to the sub-categories of cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) and cs.CY (Cryptography and Security). Finally, the paper uses ontologies to model domain knowledge, which could also make it relevant to the sub-category of cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
