Therefore, the most likely category is cs.SY (Systems and Control), which is the primary category for papers on control theory. The paper also proposes a model predictive safety certification scheme, which involves optimization and decision-making, making it relevant to categories such as cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also discusses a practical data-based design procedure, which involves optimization and numerical methods, making it relevant to categories such as cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
