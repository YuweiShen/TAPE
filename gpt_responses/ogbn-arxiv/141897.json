The use of triangulated drawings and the focus on IC-planar and NIC-planar graphs suggest that the paper may belong to the Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM) or Computational Geometry (cs.CG) sub-categories. The use of cubic time algorithms suggests that the paper may also belong to the Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) sub-category. The mention of maximal and optimal graphs suggests that the paper may also belong to the Graph Theory (cs.GT) sub-category. Finally, the mention of NP-completeness suggests that the paper may also belong to the Computational Complexity (cs.CC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
