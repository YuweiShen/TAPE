The proposed method involves adding a saliency-based distortion layer to existing networks, which is a technique for improving the performance of neural networks (cs.LG). The layer is trained in an end-to-end fashion, which involves optimizing the network's parameters using backpropagation, a common technique in machine learning (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the application of the proposed method to human gaze estimation and fine-grained object classification, which are both subfields of computer vision (cs.NE, cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
