Additionally, the paper mentions linear logic, which is a topic often studied in cs.PL (Programming Languages) and cs.CL (Computational Logic). The paper also discusses preservation properties and embeddings, which are topics that fall under cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
