The method involves learning and storing prototypes, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks (cs.CV) and natural language processing tasks (cs.CL). The method also involves avoiding catastrophic forgetting, which is a common challenge in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
