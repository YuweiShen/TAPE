The paper also proposes an automated approach for neural architecture search (NAS), which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the use of real-world inference latency as a metric for evaluating the performance of mobile CNNs, which is related to computer architecture (cs.AR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
