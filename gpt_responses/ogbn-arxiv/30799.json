The paper focuses on the analysis of V2V transmission reliability near suburban corners and urban intersections, which are critical areas for road safety. The paper uses plausible street configurations, traffic scenarios, and empirically-supported channel propagation to derive closed-form expressions for V2V transmission reliability. The paper also applies meta distribution concepts to provide a careful dissection of V2V communications reliability. Based on this analysis, the paper shows that the fine-grained reliability per realization exhibits bimodal behavior, which is an important finding for practical deployment. Given the focus on communication networks and information theory, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) and cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with control systems (cs.SY), cryptography and security (cs.CR), and machine learning (cs.MA) to some extent, which are other possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
