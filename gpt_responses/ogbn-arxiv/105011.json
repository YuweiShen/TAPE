This involves techniques such as document similarity and implicit session information. The paper also evaluates the approaches in a living lab environment. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is Information Retrieval (cs.IR) as it deals with search and retrieval of information. Digital Libraries (cs.DL) is also likely as the paper specifically focuses on browsing in a digital library. Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) is another possible sub-category as the paper discusses user experience and tailoring search results to users' needs. Natural Language Processing (cs.CL) and Cybersecurity (cs.CY) are less likely but still possible as the paper mentions the use of metadata and implicit session information, which could involve language processing and security considerations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
