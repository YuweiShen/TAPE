The paper proposes a training method to fine-tune a state-of-the-art model to extract resolution-robust deep features, which falls under the category of Machine Learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of super resolution techniques for preprocessing faces, which is related to Multimedia (cs.MM). The paper deals with the issue of cross-resolution matching, which is a topic in Cryptography and Security (cs.CR). Finally, the paper also mentions the use of low-resolution and low-quality datasets, which is related to Information Retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
