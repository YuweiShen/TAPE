The use of scattering transform-based features and textural features involves machine learning techniques, which fall under the subcategories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The application of PCA for dimensionality reduction is also a common technique in information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the use of a minimum distance classifier suggests that the paper may also be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) for template matching."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
