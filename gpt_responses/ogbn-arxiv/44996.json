The paper specifically focuses on Siamese neural networks and proposes a method to improve their accuracy using kernel-based non-parametric activation functions. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CV (Computer Vision), and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, since the paper discusses the use of neural networks, cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also a likely sub-category. Finally, since the paper discusses the use of embeddings, which are often used in natural language processing, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is also a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
