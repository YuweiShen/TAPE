The proposed method also involves self-supervised learning, which is a popular topic in machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also mentions the use of Siamese networks, which are commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) applications. Additionally, the paper discusses the need for addressing increasing diversity in facial appearance, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR) or artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
