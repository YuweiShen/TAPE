The use of well-founded relations and the mention of primitive recursive functions suggest a connection to computability theory (cs.DS). The algorithm mentioned in the abstract also involves searching for a transition invariant, which is a common technique in formal verification (cs.FL). Finally, the mention of a language designed by Podelski and Rybalchenko suggests a connection to software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
