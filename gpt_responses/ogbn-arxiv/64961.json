The method involves augmenting the original network with observer networks, which classify inputs as clean or adversarial, making it relevant to the sub-categories of computer security and cryptography (cs.CR) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of multiple observer networks also involves ensemble learning, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
