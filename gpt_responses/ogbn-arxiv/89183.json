This approach involves dividing the initial state space into different slices and gradually unifying them into a single policy. Given the focus on deep RL and optimization of policies, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning). The paper also involves tasks related to robotics (grasping, manipulation, and locomotion), which suggests sub-categories such as cs.RO (Robotics) and cs.SY (Systems and Control). Additionally, the paper involves tasks related to computer vision (e.g., object recognition), which suggests cs.CV (Computer Vision) as a likely sub-category. Finally, the paper involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques to solve complex tasks, which suggests cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
