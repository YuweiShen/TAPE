The paper also discusses the use of submodular functions, which are commonly used in optimization and combinatorial algorithms. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.SI (Social and Information Networks)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
