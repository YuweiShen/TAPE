Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language). The paper also proposes regularization terms on top of generalized expectation criteria, which suggests that it may belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE). Finally, the paper conducts experiments to justify the robustness of the proposed methods, which indicates that it may also belong to the sub-category of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
