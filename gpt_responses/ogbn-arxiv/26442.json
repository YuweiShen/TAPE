The paper specifically focuses on the use of Minor Constraint Disturbances (MCD) to improve the stability and reduce the reliance on labels in high-dimensional data space. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE), and computational linguistics (cs.CL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
