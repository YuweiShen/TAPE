The paper also discusses the need for communication and coordination in implementing a distributed control protocol, which is a topic of interest in the fields of control systems (cs.SY) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper proposes a coordination-free controllable predecessor operator, which is a concept that is relevant to the field of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
