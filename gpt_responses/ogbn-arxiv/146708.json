The use of approximation-preserving reductions (AP-reductions) is a common technique in computational complexity theory, which falls under the category of computational complexity (cs.CC). The paper also involves the study of planar graphs and maps, which are topics related to computational geometry (cs.CG). The analysis of fast mixing results for a card shuffling problem is related to the study of random walks and Markov chains, which are topics in data structures (cs.DS) and graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
