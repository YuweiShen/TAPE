The proposed solution involves using very large antenna arrays, which is a common technique in the field of networked systems (cs.NI). The paper also discusses the use of blind detection, which is a topic in signal processing and machine learning (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper focuses on the performance of the system, which is evaluated through simulations, and thus falls under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper deals with the problem of interference in wireless communication, which is a topic in communication systems (cs.COMM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
