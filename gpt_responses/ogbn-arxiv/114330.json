Therefore, the most likely category is cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory). The paper also discusses the size of the automata, which suggests that it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) or cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science). The use of joint views and maximizing output also suggests a possible connection to cs.IT (Information Theory). Finally, the mention of rational functions and Cartesian products suggests a possible connection to cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
