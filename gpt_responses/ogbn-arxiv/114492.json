The paper introduces a novel algorithmic framework for incorporating side information into approximate message passing (AMP), which is a low-complexity algorithm for solving high-dimensional regression tasks. The paper also provides rigorous performance guarantees for the proposed framework and demonstrates empirically that the state evolution (SE) can predict the mean square error accurately. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT, followed by cs.LG, cs.SP, cs.MM, and cs.NA."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
