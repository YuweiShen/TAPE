The paper also discusses the use of iso-intensity curves, which is a common technique in graphics (cs.GR). The paper also mentions stereo and point tracking, which are common topics in multimedia (cs.MM) and robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper proposes a new algorithm for feature detection, which involves identifying stable portions on iso-curves and detecting corners on them, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
