The system uses ranking metrics to present visualizations of the top k instances in the data for each insight type, and allows users to explore the space of insights through insight queries containing constraints on insight strengths and data attributes. This suggests that the paper could be relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HCI), Databases (cs.DB), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
