The use of polar codes and multi-level coding suggests that the paper falls under the information theory (cs.IT) and communication (cs.COMM) categories. The proposed scheme also involves shaping the distribution of modulated symbols, which could be relevant to the signal processing (cs.SI) and data structures (cs.DS) categories. Finally, the use of more complex decoders to outperform the random coding bound suggests a possible connection to networked systems (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
