The use of sublinear amortized cost per point suggests that the paper may belong to the computational complexity (cs.CC) or data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories. The fact that the paper deals with bivariate polynomials suggests that it may also belong to the computational geometry (cs.CG) sub-category. The use of arithmetic operations suggests that the paper may also belong to the scientific computing (cs.SC) sub-category. Finally, the use of polynomials in control systems suggests that the paper may also belong to the systems and control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
