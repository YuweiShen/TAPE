The use of alternative formulations to the convolution operation and quantization are also discussed, which could fall under the algorithms (cs.AL) or computer architecture (cs.AR) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes a neural architecture search framework, which could be relevant to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
