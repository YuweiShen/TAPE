This problem is related to information theory (cs.IT), networked systems (cs.NI), distributed computing (cs.DC), signal processing (cs.SI), and coding theory (cs.CC). The paper presents results that significantly relax the assumptions made in the literature, making it relevant to a wide range of sub-categories in computer science."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
