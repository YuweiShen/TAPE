The use of side information by the decoders is also a key aspect of the problem, which could place it in the sub-category of information theory and probability (cs.ITP). The paper also discusses the achievability of the cut-set bound, which is a common technique in network coding (cs.NI) and communication complexity (cs.CC). Finally, the paper introduces a new problem called complementary delivery index coding, which could potentially fall under the sub-category of signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
