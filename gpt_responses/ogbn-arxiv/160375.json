Therefore, the most likely category is cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). The paper also involves optimization techniques and decision-making algorithms, which are relevant to the subfields of information theory (cs.IT) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The use of highly directional beamforming and the challenging radio propagation characteristics at mmWave frequencies also suggest that the paper could be classified under the subfield of multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper proposes a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to study the properties and performance of the proposed cell selection strategy, which is a subfield of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
