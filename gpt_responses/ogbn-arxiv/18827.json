It also uses popular training strategies to train the modified CNNs. \n\nIt is also likely to belong to the sub-category of cs.CV (Computer Vision) as the experiments are conducted on image datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10) and the modified CNNs are tested for their ability to classify clean and adversarial samples. \n\nThe paper may also belong to the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as it proposes a solution to a common problem in deep learning, i.e., the vulnerability of CNNs to adversarial samples. \n\nThe sub-category of cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) is also likely as the paper proposes the use of Symmetric Activation Functions (SAFs) in non-linear signal transducer units to suppress unusual signals within network layers. \n\nFinally, the sub-category of cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) is also possible as the paper addresses the issue of adversarial attacks on deep learning models, which is a security concern."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
