The paper also discusses the performance of distance labeling and $\\ell_\\infty$-embeddings, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and computational geometry (cs.CG). The prioritized versions of these measures involve ranking and ordering, which is a topic in discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and social networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
