The use of Neyman-Pearson $\\beta$ functions and the focus on achievability and converse bounds also suggest cs.ITP (Information Theory and Probability) as a likely category. The paper also deals with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, which suggests cs.MM (Multimedia) as a possible category. The characterization of channel dispersion and the use of channel state information suggest cs.SI (Signal Processing) as another possible category. Finally, the paper deals with the design of codebooks, which suggests cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) as a possible category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
