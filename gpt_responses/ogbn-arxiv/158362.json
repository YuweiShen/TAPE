This falls under the scope of programming languages research.\n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper discusses the use of refinement types, which are based on simple predicates from an SMT decidable theory, to capture the logical or semantic properties of data structures. This is related to logic in computer science.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a technique for verifying functional properties of data structure manipulating programs, which is a key concern in software engineering.\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper focuses on the verification of correctness properties of linked data structures, which is a core topic in data structures and algorithms research.\n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper discusses the translation of typing derivations in ART into separation logic proofs, which is related to formal languages and automata theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
