The most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning) as SVMs are a popular machine learning algorithm. The paper also mentions the use of label propagation, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the paper discusses the hierarchy of problems decreasing in size, which is related to data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions the use of solved models from previous levels, which is related to neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
