The approach also involves computer vision (cs.CV) techniques for extracting semantic labels from images. The use of high-level semantic cues and discriminative landmarks suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) techniques. Finally, the paper also mentions the use of natural language processing (cs.CL) for extracting semantic labels from floorplans."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
