The paper also discusses the design principles of efficient networks, which falls under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The proposed training strategies involve optimizing the loss function, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper discusses the practical application of the framework in resource-restricted scenarios, which is related to robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
