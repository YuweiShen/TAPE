The experiments conducted in the paper involve psychophysical evaluations of the TMOs, which are related to human perception and visual cognition, suggesting that the paper could be relevant to the computer vision (cs.CV), computer graphics (cs.GR), and human-computer interaction (cs.HC) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper involves image processing and evaluation techniques, which could be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
