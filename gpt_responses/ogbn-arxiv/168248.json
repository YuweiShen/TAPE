This suggests that the paper could belong to the Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) category. Additionally, the paper focuses on information retrieval and customization, which could place it in the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) category. The use of partial evaluation, a technique for specializing programs, suggests that the paper could also belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) category.
