The proposed method involves minimizing the $\\ell_{2,1}$-norm of the signal matrix and the $\\ell_1$-norm of the error matrix, which is a well-known approach in the field of compressed sensing and sparse recovery. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). However, the paper also involves optimization and statistical analysis, which are common in the sub-categories of cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.SP (Signal Processing), and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). Additionally, the paper discusses the recoverability of the signal matrix under certain conditions, which is a topic of interest in the sub-category of cs.SI (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
