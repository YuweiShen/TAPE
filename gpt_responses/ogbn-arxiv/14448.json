It is also likely to belong to the robotics (cs.RO) sub-category as the application domain is autonomous driving. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel network architecture that involves feature encoding and fusion, which could fall under machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Finally, the paper also discusses the use of attention mechanisms, which could be relevant to natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
