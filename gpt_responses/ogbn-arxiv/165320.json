The use of tensors and their operations is emphasized, suggesting a focus on tensor-based computation. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). The paper also mentions functional dependencies and their exploitation, which could fall under cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.IT (Information Theory)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
