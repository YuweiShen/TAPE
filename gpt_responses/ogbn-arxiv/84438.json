The protocol is designed to tolerate byzantine failures, which is a common topic in cryptography and security (cs.CR). The protocol also involves the creation and management of blocks, which is a common topic in data structures (cs.DS). The protocol relies on networking and message delays, which is a common topic in networked systems (cs.NI).
