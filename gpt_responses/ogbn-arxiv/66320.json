The paper involves optimization under time-varying wireless fading channels and stochastic edge computing capability, which suggests that it could belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT) or Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. The use of deep reinforcement learning also suggests that it could belong to the Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE) or Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the paper deals with optimization and algorithmic aspects, which suggests that it could also belong to the Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
