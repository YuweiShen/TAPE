The framework uses lambda calculus and higher order logic, which are also relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the treatment of determiners, quantifiers, and plurals, which are topics in programming languages (cs.PL) and logic (cs.LO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
