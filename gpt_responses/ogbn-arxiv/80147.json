It also involves algebraic techniques and lattice-based algorithms, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and data structures (cs.DS). The proposed Ring-BKW algorithm is a variant of the Blum-Kalai-Wasserman algorithm, which is a well-known algorithm in the field of theoretical computer science (cs.CC). Finally, the paper discusses the advantages of exploiting the ring structure, which is a topic in the field of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
