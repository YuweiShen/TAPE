This involves using a temporal network to predict Temporal Flow Fields (TFF) which indicate the direction in which body joints are moving. The paper also formulates a similarity measure of detected joints and uses this to perform tracking of multiple poses. Given these aspects, the most likely sub-category is computer vision (cs.CV). Additionally, the use of a bipartite graph optimization problem suggests a potential fit with robotics (cs.RO). The use of a CNN network for learning TFF suggests a potential fit with machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the use of a similarity measure and optimization problem suggests a potential fit with artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
