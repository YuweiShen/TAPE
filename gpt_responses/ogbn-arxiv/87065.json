The construction of a monotone drawing involves the use of data structures (cs.DS) and algorithms for graph theory (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the properties of graphs, such as their inner and outer faces, which are related to graph theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper presents an improvement on previously known results for outerplanar graphs, which is a topic in computational complexity and optimization (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
