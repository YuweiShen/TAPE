This involves the use of domination amount, crowding distance, and hypervolume calculations to meet various optimization requirements adaptively and autonomously. The paper also applies the proposed approach to a generic structural fault identification problem. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning), as the paper involves the use of reinforcement learning and heuristics. The next likely sub-categories are cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.SY (Systems and Control), as the paper deals with optimization problems. Finally, cs.SE (Software Engineering) is also a possible sub-category, as the paper discusses the development of a software tool for multi-objective optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
