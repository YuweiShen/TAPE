The paper also discusses the use of signal constellations, which is a topic related to coding theory (cs.CC). The paper also mentions simulation results, which suggests a focus on networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) or social and information networks (cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions the use of Gaussian approximation, which is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
