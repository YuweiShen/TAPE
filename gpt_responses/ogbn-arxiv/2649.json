It also mentions the use of a modern programming tool chain for versioning, distributed development, build, testing and continuous integration, which falls under software engineering (cs.SE). The library is built in Clojure, a modern Lisp dialect, which is a programming language (cs.PL). Finally, ontologies are often used in databases and data management, which relates to the database sub-category (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
