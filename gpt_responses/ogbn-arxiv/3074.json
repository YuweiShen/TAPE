This is a common problem in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG), and the paper presents experiments on popular image classification models and datasets. The method involves adding coefficients to the channels during training, which is a form of optimization (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the trade-offs between computation and accuracy, which is a common theme in neural network research (cs.NE). Finally, the paper presents a novel approach to computation scaling, which could be of interest to researchers in data structures (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
