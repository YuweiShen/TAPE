The paper proposes a method for detecting objects that are unknown at training time, which is a challenging problem in the field. The paper uses deep learning techniques to learn to match templates of objects in images, which is a common approach in computer vision. Given these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). Other likely sub-categories include cs.RO (Robotics), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.GR (Graphics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
