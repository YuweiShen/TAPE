The concept of $(k,p)$-planarity is a generalization of hybrid planarity, which is a well-studied topic in graph theory and combinatorics (cs.DM). The paper also discusses the complexity of planarity testing, which is a fundamental problem in computational complexity theory (cs.DS). The study of combinatorial properties of $(2,2)$-planar graphs and their relationship with $1$-planar graphs involves graph theory and combinatorics (cs.GT). Finally, the paper discusses families of graphs that are $(2,2)$-planar or not, which can be seen as a problem in graph theory and algorithm design (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
