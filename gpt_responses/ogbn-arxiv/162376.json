The paper also discusses the power consumption of the system, which is relevant to embedded systems design.\n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The Phalanx framework involves the interconnection of clusters and the NOC, which may involve the use of control systems for efficient communication and coordination."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
