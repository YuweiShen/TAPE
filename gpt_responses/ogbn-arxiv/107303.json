This involves exploring all behaviors of a concurrent program up to a fixed number of context switches for each thread, rather than bounding the number of switches of all threads. This topic is relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including programming languages (cs.PL), software engineering (cs.SE), logic in computer science (cs.LO), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
