The paper also discusses how the proposed method can be used for clustering, outlier detection, visualization, etc., which are tasks commonly studied in the sub-fields of machine learning (cs.LG), data mining (cs.DS), and database systems (cs.DB). The paper also mentions experiments on synthetic and real graphs from disparate domains, which suggests that the paper may be relevant to the sub-field of social network analysis (cs.SI) and possibly also to the sub-field of software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
