This involves analyzing whole-slide images of prostatectomies, which falls under computer vision (cs.CV). The system was developed using pathologist-annotated image patches, indicating the use of machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DL). The paper also mentions the potential for refining the Gleason system itself, which could involve information retrieval (cs.IR) techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
