The network includes deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the use of multi-scale features and fusion networks, which are relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
