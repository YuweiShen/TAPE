The use of STBC and OFDM techniques suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of systems and control (cs.SY) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI). Finally, the proposed compensation algorithms involve signal processing techniques, which may also place the paper in the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
