This involves the use of energy detection (ED) receivers, which are commonly used in communication systems and fall under the category of information theory (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the impact of noise and channel hardening, which are topics related to communication systems (cs.COMM) and control systems (cs.SY). The use of massive receiver arrays in millimeter-waveband is a topic related to multimedia (cs.MM) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
