The paper also proposes new normalization techniques that can potentially improve performance in other machine learning tasks, such as image recognition (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of large learning rates and the optimization of training, which are relevant to the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
