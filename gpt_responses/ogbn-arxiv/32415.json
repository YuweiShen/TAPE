The proposed architectures involve the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and multi-stream convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are popular techniques in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper evaluates its proposed methods on datasets related to video analysis (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
