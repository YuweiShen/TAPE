The paper proposes two novel compositional plural semantics for constructor systems and studies their basic properties, which are relevant to all of these sub-categories. Therefore, cs.PL is the most likely sub-category, followed by cs.LO, cs.FL, cs.SE, and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
