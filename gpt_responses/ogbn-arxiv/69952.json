This involves the use of information theory concepts such as channel capacity and bit-error-rate analysis, which are typically studied in the cs.IT sub-category.\n\n2. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper deals with the downlink of MIMO VLC systems, which involves the transmission of data from a central node (e.g., access point) to multiple users. This is a networking problem, and hence the paper could be classified under cs.NI.\n\n3. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper proposes a technique to improve the spectral efficiency and link reliability of MIMO VLC systems, which are important aspects of communication systems. Hence, the paper could be classified under cs.COMM.\n\n4. cs.OH (Other Computer Science): The paper deals with visible light communications, which is a relatively new and interdisciplinary field that involves aspects of optics, electronics, and computer science. Hence, the paper could be classified under cs.OH.\n\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with the transmission of data over visible light, which is a form of multimedia communication. Hence, the paper could be classified under cs.MM."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
