The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the problem, which suggests a connection to algorithms and complexity theory (cs.DS). The use of minimax regret and the vulnerability of the approach to manipulation suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper proposes a novel solution to the problem, which suggests a connection to multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
