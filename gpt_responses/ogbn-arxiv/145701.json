The use of concentration of measure inequalities and the focus on submodular and XOS functions also suggest categories related to information theory (cs.IT) and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the study of self-bounding functions could also fall under the category of social and information networks (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
