The method uses a heuristic estimation of the prior probability of beliefs, which involves machine learning (LG) techniques. The choice of policy trees is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem, which is a topic in systems and control (SY) and mathematical optimization (MA). Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.AI, cs.RO, and cs.LG, followed by cs.SY and cs.MA."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
