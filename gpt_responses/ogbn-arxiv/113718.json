This is a core area of computer vision research.\n2. cs.SD (Sound): The paper also uses acoustic features from audio tracks to estimate valence and arousal, which falls under the domain of sound processing.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with multi-modal data (visual and audio) and their fusion, which is a key area of multimedia research.\n4. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper explores the correlations between valence/arousal, emotions, and facial actions, which can be seen as a social network of sorts.\n5. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper deals with emotion recognition, which is a subfield of natural language processing and can be considered as a form of language understanding."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
