The paper proposes the use of a model-free random searching strategy, which is a type of reinforcement learning, and compares its performance with a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm. Therefore, the paper also falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also makes use of simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, which falls under the category of computer vision (cs.CV) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
