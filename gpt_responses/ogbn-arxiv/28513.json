This involves using features to describe local patterns as inputs, which are gradually created during the self-play training process. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): This sub-category covers research on various AI techniques, including game playing, which is the focus of this paper. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): This sub-category covers research on various machine learning techniques, including linear function approximators, which are used in this paper. \n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): This sub-category covers research on various game theory topics, including game playing, which is the focus of this paper. \n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): This sub-category covers research on various programming languages and their applications, which may be relevant to the implementation of the proposed method. \n- cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): This sub-category covers research on various neural and evolutionary computing techniques, which are not used in this paper but may be relevant to the comparison with deep neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
