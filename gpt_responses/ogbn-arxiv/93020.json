This involves mapping skeleton joints into a 3D coordinate space and encoding spatial and temporal information separately, followed by the adoption of 3D CNN models to extract deep features from two streams. The paper also extends every stream into a multitemporal version to enhance the ability of deep features to capture global relationships. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are computer vision (cs.CV), machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), multimedia (cs.MM), and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
