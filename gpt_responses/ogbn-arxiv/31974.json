This is a topic that falls under information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also discusses the I-MMSE relation of Guo et al., which is a topic in statistical inference (cs.MM) and signal processing (cs.SI). The use of a Gaussian test channel suggests a connection to computer vision (cs.CV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
