The paper specifically focuses on the impact of interference uncertainty on covert communication, which falls under the category of networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of artificial noise to aid in hiding communication, which relates to multimedia (cs.MM) as it involves the manipulation of signals."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
