The generator is also optimized for performance, which suggests a focus on algorithms and data structures (cs.GR). The paper also mentions the use of the generator for randomized algorithms such as reservoir sampling, which falls under the category of data structures (cs.DS). The design of the generator involves a new permutation built from an improved generalized Feistel structure, which is a common technique in the design of block ciphers (cs.CC). Finally, the paper mentions the potential use of the permutation for wide-block ciphers and hashing functions, which suggests a focus on systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
