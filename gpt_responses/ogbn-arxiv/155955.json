The paper also discusses the use of pre-training and the transfer of knowledge, which are topics commonly studied in machine learning (cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE). Additionally, the paper proposes a method for reducing the number of parameters in object detectors, which is a topic related to model compression (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
