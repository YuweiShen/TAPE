This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of deep learning models for survival analysis may involve image processing (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) techniques, which are also relevant to the paper. Finally, the paper may also fall under the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (cs.CE) sub-category, given its focus on patient-specific kidney graft survival analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
