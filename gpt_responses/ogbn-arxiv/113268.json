Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also proposes a novel network topology structure and building block, which involves deep learning techniques, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) another likely sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of deformable convolutions and coherent loss, which are also commonly used in deep learning, making cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) a possible sub-category. The paper also deals with face recognition, which falls under the sub-category cs.MM (Multimedia), and finally, the paper mentions the use of datasets, which is related to information retrieval, making cs.IR (Information Retrieval) a possible sub-category as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
