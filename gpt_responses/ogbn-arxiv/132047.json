This involves training neural networks to leverage the semantic properties of word embeddings to improve on existing controversy detection methods. The paper also evaluates model stability over time and to unseen topics, testing cross-temporal, cross-topic, cross-domain performance and annotator congruence. Given these factors, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.CL (Computation and Language), cs.IR (Information Retrieval), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), and cs.CY (Computers and Society)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
