The use of functional forms and simulation-based optimisation suggests a focus on numerical methods and algorithms, which are common in the fields of neural networks (cs.NE), machine learning (cs.MA), and control systems (cs.SY). The problem of balancing blocking and costs also involves information theory (cs.IT) and probability theory (cs.PF)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
