Additionally, the paper mentions the use of deep learning techniques, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) research. The paper also discusses the use of a controllable model, which suggests that it may fall under the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) category.
