This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The use of optical flows and cross-link layers also involves learning from temporal data, which could be relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and multimedia (cs.MM) sub-categories. Additionally, the attention mechanisms and optimization techniques used in the paper could be relevant to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
