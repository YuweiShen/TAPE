However, the focus on attributes as a means of exchanging information between the two modalities suggests that it is most likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) sub-categories. Additionally, the use of knowledge mined from language resources for visual recognition suggests a connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI), while the generation of sentence descriptions and grounding of natural language in visual content suggest a connection to language generation (cs.LG) and information retrieval (cs.IR), respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
