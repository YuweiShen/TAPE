This involves computer vision techniques such as stereo matching and re-projection error minimization, which are commonly used in the computer vision (cs.CV) and robotics (cs.RO) fields. Additionally, the paper discusses the interactive aspects of the AR framework, such as adding annotations and measurement labelling, which fall under the human-computer interaction (cs.HC) category. The use of geometric information and 3D mesh reconstruction also suggests a potential overlap with the graphics (cs.GR) and multimedia (cs.MM) categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
