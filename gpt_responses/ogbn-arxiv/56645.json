The use of APN functions and planar functions over finite fields suggests a connection to cryptography (cs.CR). The paper also involves the calculation of linear spans and minimal polynomials, which are topics in linear algebra and algebraic geometry, respectively, suggesting a connection to discrete mathematics (cs.DS) and scientific computing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper specifically mentions the open problems presented in \\cite{D}, which are related to cyclic codes from highly nonlinear functions, suggesting a connection to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
