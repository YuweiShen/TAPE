The paper also introduces a new generalization bound and regularization strategies, which are related to information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper presents numerical results on various datasets, which is relevant to the sub-category of scientific computing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
