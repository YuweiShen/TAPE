The examples given in the abstract (finite-dimensional vector spaces, lambda-calculus syntax, indexed containers) suggest that the paper may be relevant to subfields such as logic (cs.LO), programming languages (cs.PL), category theory (cs.CT), software engineering (cs.SE), and formal languages (cs.FL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
