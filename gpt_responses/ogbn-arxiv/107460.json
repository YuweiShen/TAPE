This involves concepts such as resource path and triple path, and an algorithm for traversing the new graph. The paper also discusses implementations of the graph model, including a new graph engine and an extension of an existing system. These topics are relevant to several sub-categories of computer science, including databases (cs.DB), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), deep learning (cs.DL), and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
