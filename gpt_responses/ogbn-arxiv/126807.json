Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and structured support vector machines (SSVMs), which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper mentions the use of pre-trained contextualized embeddings, which are often used in natural language processing and deep learning (cs.NE). Finally, the paper may also fall under computer vision (cs.CV) since it deals with analyzing text data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
