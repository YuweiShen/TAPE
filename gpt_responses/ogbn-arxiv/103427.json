This implementation is relevant to software engineering. \n\n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper takes advantage of the infrastructural support for distributed computing in Erlang, which is a programming language designed for building distributed systems. This is relevant to the distributed computing subcategory. \n\n5. cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper presents a formalization of session types in a lambda calculus, which involves formal language and automata theory concepts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
