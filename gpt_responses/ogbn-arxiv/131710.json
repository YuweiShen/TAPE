This falls under the category of robotics (cs.RO) and computer vision (cs.CV). The use of deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the evidential framework suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the incorporation of uncertainty in the model suggests that the paper may also belong to the sub-category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
