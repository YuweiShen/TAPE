The system also carries semantic information and existence probability for each object. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The proposed system can be used for tracking, relocalisation and loop closure detection, which are important tasks in robotics. \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning): The system uses Mask-RCNN instance segmentation to initialise object reconstructions, which is a machine learning technique. \n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The system carries semantic information and existence probability for each object, which are related to artificial intelligence. \n- cs.GR (Graphics): The system builds a persistent and accurate 3D graph map of arbitrary reconstructed objects, which is related to computer graphics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
