The paper proposes a unified framework for modeling large teams of heterogeneous robots and performing optimal task assignments. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category. Additionally, the paper uses stochastic methods to perform task assignments, which suggests that it may also belong to the Machine Learning (cs.MA) sub-category. The paper also uses measures of diversity to evaluate the performance of the task assignments, which suggests that it may belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper deals with large teams of robots, which suggests that it may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category. Finally, the paper uses simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, which suggests that it may also belong to the Learning (cs.LG) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
