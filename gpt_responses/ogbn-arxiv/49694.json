The proposed solution involves the use of deep learning (LG) to predict beamforming vectors, which is a common application of artificial intelligence (AI) in wireless communications. Finally, the paper specifically mentions the use of large antenna arrays, which is a characteristic of mmWave systems and falls under the category of multimedia (MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
