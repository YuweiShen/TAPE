The paper evaluates the accuracy of a generic parts-of-speech (POS) tagger, MontyTagger, on biomedical text and compares it to a biomedical-specific POS tagger, MedPost. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language) which deals with natural language processing and computational linguistics. Other likely sub-categories include cs.IR (Information Retrieval) as the paper deals with extracting information from text, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) as the paper discusses the performance of different taggers, and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) as neural networks are used in some biomedical entity relationship extraction tools."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
