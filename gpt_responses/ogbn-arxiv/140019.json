This involves computer vision techniques and hence, it is highly likely that this paper belongs to the cs.CV sub-category.\n2. cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction): The paper focuses on developing a clinical decision support system for autism spectrum disorders, which involves interaction between humans and computers. Hence, it is likely that this paper belongs to the cs.HC sub-category.\n3. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper uses machine learning techniques such as deep neural networks and decision trees for feature extraction and classification. Hence, it is likely that this paper belongs to the cs.LG sub-category.\n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper proposes an automatic screening system for autism spectrum disorders, which involves the use of artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning and computer vision. Hence, it is likely that this paper belongs to the cs.AI sub-category.\n5. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper uses video clips collected from YouTube for developing the database of typical and atypical behaviors in children with autism. Hence, it is possible that this paper belongs to the cs.MM sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
