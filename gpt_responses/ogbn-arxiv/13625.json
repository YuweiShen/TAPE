The proposed algorithm is designed to work in real-time and provide estimates of the unknown and time-varying attack parameters and recovered state estimates, which involves the use of control systems (cs.SY) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses countermeasures against stealthy attacks, which involves the study of network security (cs.NI) and software engineering (cs.SE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
