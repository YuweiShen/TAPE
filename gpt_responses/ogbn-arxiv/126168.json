The algorithm is also described as a linear-space, randomised algorithm, which suggests a potential connection to distributed computing (cs.DC) and statistical computing (cs.SI). Finally, the paper mentions empirical results that demonstrate a quasi-linear runtime in practice, which could be relevant to computational complexity (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
