The paper proposes a new method of multi-cell tracking that incorporates dependency on the cells' movements into the prediction model. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper uses a Markov random field to model the target cells' correlated movements, which is a common technique in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper deals with bioimage informatics, which is a sub-field of scientific computing (cs.SI). Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NE, and cs.SI, in that order."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
