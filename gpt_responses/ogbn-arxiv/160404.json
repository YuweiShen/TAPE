The paper also proposes an approach to construct deterministic feedback coding schemes, which is related to information theory. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also deals with the problem of finding filters to achieve feedback capacity, which is a problem in signal processing and control theory, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) another likely sub-category. The paper also proposes an asymptotic capacity-achieving upper bound, which involves optimization and numerical evaluation, making cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture) a possible sub-category. The paper also provides examples to demonstrate the proposed approach, making cs.MM (Multimedia) a possible sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the problem of finding communication systems that achieve a lower bound rate, which is related to machine learning and optimization, making cs.LG (Machine Learning) a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
