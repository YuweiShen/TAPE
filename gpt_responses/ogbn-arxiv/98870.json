The paper also discusses the comparison of achievable rates under different feedback schemes, which falls under signal processing (cs.SI) and multimedia (cs.MM). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the feedback schemes, which falls under computer communications (cs.COM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
