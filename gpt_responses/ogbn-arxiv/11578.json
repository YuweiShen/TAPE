This falls under the broad category of machine learning (cs.LG) and specifically deals with computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE). The paper also discusses the application of the lottery ticket hypothesis to larger networks such as Resnet-50 for ImageNet, which could potentially fall under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as well. Finally, the paper mentions the use of natural language processing models, which could place it under computational linguistics (cs.CL) as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
