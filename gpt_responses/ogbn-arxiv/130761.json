The paper proposes an efficient implementation of the color coding algorithm to solve the problem. The color coding algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that has been used to solve many combinatorial problems, including the subgraph isomorphism problem. The paper also provides an extensive experimental comparison of their implementation to other available solvers for the problem. Based on this, the likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), and cs.DL (Digital Libraries)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
