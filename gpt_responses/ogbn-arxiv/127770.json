The paper also heavily relies on geometric methods and algorithms, which suggests that it could also belong to the computational geometry sub-category (cs.CG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of sampling-based approaches, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and control systems (cs.SY). Finally, the paper introduces a novel characterization of narrow passages, which could be of interest to researchers in the sub-category of dynamical systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
