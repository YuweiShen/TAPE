The approach involves using RGB-D views of scenes containing objects, which suggests computer vision (cs.CV) as another likely sub-category. The use of deep learning also suggests machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as possible sub-categories. Finally, the fact that the method is used to successfully execute grasps on two different robotic platforms suggests systems and control (cs.SY) as a possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
