This involves creating a shared agent-entity graph, where agents and environmental entities form vertices, and edges exist between the vertices which can communicate with each other. The paper presents state-of-the-art results on coverage, formation and line control tasks for multi-agent teams in a fully decentralized framework and further shows that the learned policies quickly transfer to scenarios with different team sizes along with strong zero-shot generalization performance. Based on this, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories are cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), and cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems). Additionally, the paper also involves robotics (cs.RO) and control systems (cs.SY) which are relevant sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
