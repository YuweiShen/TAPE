It could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category as it discusses a new method for training neural networks. Additionally, it could be classified under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as deep learning is a subfield of AI. The paper also deals with memory optimization, which could place it under the computer architecture (cs.DC) sub-category.
