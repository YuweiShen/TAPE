Therefore, cs.RO (Robotics) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also involves the use of nonlinear contraction theory, which is a technique commonly used in control systems and system theory, making cs.SY (Systems and Control) another likely sub-category. The use of dynamic movement primitives and their extension using machine learning techniques also suggests a connection to cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper involves the use of computer vision techniques to fly over an obstacle, which could place it in the cs.CV (Computer Vision) sub-category. Finally, the use of machine learning techniques to learn aggressive maneuvers could also place it in the cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
