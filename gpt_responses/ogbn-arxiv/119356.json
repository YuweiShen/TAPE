The paper also develops an optimization approach to find the set of controllable virtual resistances that maximize SNR under the constraints on the supplied power deviations. \n2. cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper assesses the case in which the information is modulated in the deviations of reference voltages of the primary control loops and shows that the outputs of the power talk communication channels can be approximated through linear combinations of the respective inputs. \n3. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper proposes a communication framework for DC MicroGrids, which are distributed systems. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes a communication framework for DC MicroGrids, which involves communication channels. \n5. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper proposes a communication framework for DC MicroGrids, which can be seen as a network of interconnected units."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
