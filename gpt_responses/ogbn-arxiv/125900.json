This involves the use of AI techniques such as conceptual blending and feature selection. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) - The paper may be relevant to the sub-category of social and information networks as it involves the blending of different musical idioms and the evaluation of the resulting harmonic spaces. \n4. cs.CY (Computers and Society) - The paper may be relevant to the sub-category of computers and society as it explores the intersection of technology and musicology, and how AI tools can be used to assist musicologists in their work. \n5. cs.DL (Machine Learning) - The paper may be relevant to the sub-category of machine learning as it involves the use of AI techniques such as feature selection and conceptual blending to generate novel harmonic spaces."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
