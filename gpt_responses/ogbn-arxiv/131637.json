The paper proposes a new method called Trained Rank Pruning (TRP) that integrates low-rank approximation and regularization into the training process. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, indicating that it may also belong to the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) and data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
