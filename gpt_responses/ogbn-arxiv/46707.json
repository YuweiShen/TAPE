The use of integer programming formulations and branch-and-cut algorithms suggests that this paper may also be relevant to optimization (cs.LG) and algorithms (cs.DS). The application of planning to robotics (cs.RO) is also a possibility. Finally, the paper's focus on modeling state variables and value transitions suggests that it may also be relevant to programming languages and compilers (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
