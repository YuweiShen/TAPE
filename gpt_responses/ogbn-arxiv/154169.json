This falls under the computer vision (cs.CV) and machine learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. The paper also discusses the development of methods that measure uncertainty and adapt segmentation based on a specific false positive vs. false negative tradeoff, which falls under the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The use of quantitative myocardial blood flow (MBF) maps and the Tversky loss function also suggest a potential fit for the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category. Finally, the use of Monte Carlo (MC) dropout in the modified UNET architecture suggests a potential fit for the neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
