The paper presents results related to the algebraic and metric properties of interleaving distance on multidimensional persistence modules. This makes it likely to belong to sub-categories such as cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.CG (Computational Geometry), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
