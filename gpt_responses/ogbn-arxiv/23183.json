This falls under the domain of systems and control theory. \n- cs.DS (Discrete Mathematics): The paper deals with discrete-time systems and the computation of robust invariant sets. This falls under the domain of discrete mathematics. \n- cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science): The paper uses sum of squares decomposition for polynomials to encode inequality constraints. This technique has applications in logic and verification. \n- cs.RO (Robotics): The paper deals with the problem of finding robust invariant sets, which is a fundamental problem in robotics for ensuring safety and stability of robotic systems. \n- cs.NA (Numerical Analysis): The paper proposes a computational approach for solving the problem of finding robust invariant sets using value iteration and semi-definite programming. This falls under the domain of numerical analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
