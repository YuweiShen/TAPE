The use of deep learning methods also indicates that it could be classified under machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also deals with the challenges of analyzing large-scale satellite data, which could fall under information retrieval (cs.IR) or graphics (cs.GR) sub-categories. Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the proposed methods, which could involve natural language processing (cs.CL) for generating textual descriptions of the detected roads."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
