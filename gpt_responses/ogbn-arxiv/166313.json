The paper's focus on polynomial-time problems and $\\omega$-regular objectives suggests that it is more likely to be classified under cs.LO and cs.DS, but the use of MDPs and the study of disjunctive queries and dual objectives also make cs.AI and cs.PL plausible categories. Finally, the paper's use of conditional lower bounds based on widely believed assumptions about the complexity of CNF-SAT and combinatorial Boolean matrix multiplication suggests that it may also be relevant to the area of computational complexity theory (cs.CC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
