The focus is on the usability of the technique for analysts, and the paper presents a set of interaction techniques that enable analysts to dynamically grow, re-structure, and aggregate the tree, as well as change the layout or show paths between nodes. The paper also demonstrates the utility of the tool in usage scenarios for different multivariate networks. Based on this, the most likely sub-category is Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), followed by Social and Information Networks (cs.SI), Databases (cs.DB), Information Retrieval (cs.IR), and Computational Geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
