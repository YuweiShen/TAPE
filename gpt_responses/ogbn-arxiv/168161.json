The paper also discusses different styles of specification, such as equational and functional, which are relevant to this field.\n- cs.PL (Programming Languages): The paper discusses the specification and verification of software and hardware components, which is a topic relevant to the field of programming languages. The paper also mentions support for recursive specifications, which is a common feature in programming languages.\n- cs.SE (Software Engineering): The paper presents a framework for the formalization and verification of distributed systems, which is a topic relevant to software engineering. The paper also discusses the use of assumption/guarantee specifications, which is a technique commonly used in software engineering for reasoning about system behavior.\n- cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper specifically mentions that the framework is well-suited for the formalization and verification of distributed systems. The paper also discusses the use of asynchronous message passing, which is a common technique in distributed computing.\n- cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory): The paper discusses different styles of specification, such as state-based and relational, which are relevant to the field of formal languages and automata theory.
