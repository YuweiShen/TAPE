The use of switched capacitor circuits is a common technique in analog and mixed-signal circuit design (cs.AR and cs.CE). Finally, the paper also discusses the benefits of technology scaling, which is a topic often discussed in machine learning and computer engineering (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
