The protocol is designed to work in an on-line, worst-case fashion, which suggests a focus on networking and communication (cs.NI) and systems and control (cs.SY). The paper also presents an analysis of the expected number of access attempts, which involves probabilistic and algorithmic techniques (cs.DS, cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
