The paper focuses on computer vision tasks and specifically on instance segmentation, which suggests that the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning techniques such as linear combination and prototype masks, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of Fast NMS, which is a technique for object detection, suggesting that it could also belong to cs.MM (Multimedia) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
