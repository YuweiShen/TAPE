Therefore, cs.CG (Computational Geometry) and cs.GT (Game Theory) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also uses polynomial evaluation as a key subroutine, which falls under cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) and cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). Finally, the paper deals with the area and perimeter of geometric objects, which falls under cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
