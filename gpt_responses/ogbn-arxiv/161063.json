The proposed method uses deep learning (LG) and artificial intelligence (AI) to fuse information from multiple views and generate 3D bounding boxes. The paper also mentions the use of natural language processing (CL) for the task of 2D detection. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CV, followed by cs.RO, cs.LG, cs.AI, and cs.CL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
