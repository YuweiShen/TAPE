The paper proposes a method for selecting phrases with out-of-vocabulary words using branching entropy, which is a statistical approach commonly used in NLP. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which covers NLP and related topics. The paper also uses machine learning techniques, such as NMT and SMT (Statistical Machine Translation), which are covered by sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on patent documents, which are often related to information retrieval (IR) and computer vision (CV), so cs.IR and cs.CV are also possible sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
