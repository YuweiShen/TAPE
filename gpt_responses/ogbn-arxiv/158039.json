This topic is closely related to the field of control systems (cs.SY), as well as artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG) due to the use of optimization algorithms. The paper also discusses the use of time-dependent signals, which is relevant to software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
