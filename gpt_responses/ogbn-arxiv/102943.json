The paper proposes extended Enhanced Sequential Inference Model (ESIM) models for response selection in retrieval-based dialog systems, which involves incorporating external domain knowledge and leveraging information from similar conversations. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.CL (Computation and Language), which deals with NLP and AI. The paper also involves machine learning techniques, which makes cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) another likely sub-category. The proposed models involve neural networks, which makes cs.LG (Machine Learning) another possible sub-category. The paper also involves information retrieval techniques, which makes cs.IR (Information Retrieval) another possible sub-category. Finally, the paper involves sequential modeling, which makes cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) another possible sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
