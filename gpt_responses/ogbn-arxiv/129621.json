The topic is related to networking (NI) and information theory (IT) as it involves optimizing data transmissions and reducing interference. The proposed location-based beamforming mechanism also involves multimedia (MM) techniques. The coordination of multiple APs also involves system (SY) design and control (CR) mechanisms. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.NI, followed by cs.IT, cs.MM, cs.SY, and cs.CR."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
