Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CV (Computer Vision). Additionally, the paper also discusses the use of dynamic feedback and power-limit settings, which are related to system design and optimization, suggesting that it could also be categorized under cs.SD (Systems and Control) and cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
