The system uses computer vision techniques such as feature descriptors, which are commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV). The system also uses state estimation frameworks, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the system is designed for autonomous vehicles, which is a subfield of control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
