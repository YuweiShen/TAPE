The paper also discusses the Bhattacharyya parameters, which are commonly used in coding theory and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper uses mathematical analysis and provides lower bounds on a parameter, which is a common approach in theoretical computer science (cs.CC). The paper also deals with the scaling behavior of polar codes, which is a topic in algorithms and data structures (cs.DS). Finally, the paper discusses the conjecture that the parameter for the binary erasure channel is the optimal value, which is a topic in machine learning and statistics (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
