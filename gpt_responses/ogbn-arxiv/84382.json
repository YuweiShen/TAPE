The use of hard negative examples is a popular technique in machine learning (cs.LG) and the paper proposes a method for automatically obtaining such examples. The method involves analyzing video sequences, which could also fall under the category of multimedia (cs.MM). The paper also discusses the use of deep learning architectures, which is a common topic in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper involves mining data, which could also fall under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
