This involves techniques from computational complexity theory, graph theory, and algorithms. Therefore, the most likely sub-categories are cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), and cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics). Additionally, the paper also discusses the framework of constraint implementations and connections between optimal running times for solving Max CSPs, which are relevant to the sub-categories cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.CG (Computational Geometry)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
