The paper describes a web-based system for visualizing and exploring large textual corpora based on topics, using natural language processing methods to convert the corpus into high-dimensional vectors and projecting them onto a 2D plane. This suggests a focus on information retrieval (cs.IR), natural language processing (cs.CL), and deep learning (cs.DL) techniques. The system also includes a web-based visualization module for interacting with the corpus, indicating a potential focus on human-computer interaction (cs.HC) and social informatics (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
