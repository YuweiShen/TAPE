The paper also discusses worst-case attacks against these codes, which falls under the cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) sub-category. The use of different decoders and colluder classes suggests that the paper may also belong to the cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) sub-category. The paper also discusses the achievable rates of the codes, which suggests that it may belong to the cs.CC (Computational Complexity) sub-category.
