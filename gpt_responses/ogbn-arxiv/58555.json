The problem is formulated as a matching problem on a hypergraph, which suggests that it could also belong to the category of discrete mathematics (cs.DM) or combinatorics (cs.CC). The paper also presents non-asymptotic bounds on the sizes of codes, which could be of interest to researchers in data structures (cs.DS) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
