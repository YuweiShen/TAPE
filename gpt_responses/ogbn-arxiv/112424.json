The paper also involves the study of regret minimization, which is a common theme in the field of theoretical computer science. The use of subset-wise relative preference information feedback is a specific problem that can be categorized under the subfield of decision making and game theory (cs.GT). Finally, the empirical evaluations conducted in the paper involve the use of algorithms and data structures (cs.DS) and the analysis of the results involves the use of mathematical optimization techniques (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
