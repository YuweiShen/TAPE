The paper focuses on natural language processing (NLP) techniques applied to bibliographic information, which is a common topic in the Information Retrieval (cs.IR) and Computational Linguistics (cs.CL) sub-categories. The use of embeddings and deep learning techniques also suggests a connection to the Deep Learning (cs.DL) and Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-categories. Finally, the search system aspect of the paper suggests a connection to the Database (cs.DB) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
