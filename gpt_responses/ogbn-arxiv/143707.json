Specifically, the paper introduces a generalized multi-armed bandit framework that allows for auxiliary information to appear arbitrarily over time, and characterizes the minimax complexity of this family of problems. This suggests that the paper could be classified under several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), cs.IT (Information Theory), and cs.SY (Systems and Control)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
