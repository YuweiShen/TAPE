The focus on ergodic processes suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and machine learning (cs.LG), where ergodicity is often studied. The use of empirical estimates of distributional distance suggests a connection to statistics (cs.ST) and mathematical statistics (cs.MS). Finally, the three specific problems addressed in the paper (goodness-of-fit testing, process classification, and change point detection) suggest a connection to signal processing (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
