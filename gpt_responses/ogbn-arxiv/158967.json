It also involves the analysis of polynomial equations, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC). The use of numerical techniques and evaluation of ensembles suggests a connection to data structures and algorithms (cs.DS) and statistical inference (cs.SI). Finally, the study of symmetry properties in the weight spectral shape may relate to network science (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
