It uses succinct data structures to enable the representation of triples in a self-indexed, compact manner without requiring decompression at query answering time. Moreover, it is adapted to efficiently support RDF and RDFS entailment regimes thanks to an optimized encoding of ontology concepts and properties that does not require a complete inference materialization or extensive query rewriting algorithms. These aspects suggest that the paper could be relevant to several arXiv CS sub-categories, including cs.DB (databases), cs.AI (artificial intelligence), cs.DS (data structures and algorithms), cs.IR (information retrieval), and cs.SE (software engineering)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
