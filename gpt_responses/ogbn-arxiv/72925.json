The use of a robotic arm and electroencephalography (EEG) also suggests a potential application in robotics (cs.RO). The paper also involves image processing and feature extraction, which are common topics in computer vision (cs.CV). The study aims to decode user movement intentions, which is a common goal in the field of neural engineering (cs.NE). Finally, the study involves human-computer interaction, which is a topic in human-computer interaction (cs.HC)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
