The paper proposes to study the instance-wise optimality for the problem and introduces a new quantity called the gap entropy for a best-arm problem instance. These topics are closely related to the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, data structures, information theory, and control systems, which are covered by the arXiv sub-categories cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DS, cs.IT, and cs.SY. Therefore, these are the most likely sub-categories for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
