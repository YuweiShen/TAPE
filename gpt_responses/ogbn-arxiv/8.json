This falls under the domain of human-computer interaction.\n2. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper discusses the societal challenge of managing healthcare needs of an aging population and proposes a technological solution. This falls under the domain of computers and society.\n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper discusses the communication between patients and clinicians facilitated by the wHealth platform. This falls under the domain of social and information networks.\n4. cs.OH (Other Computer Science): The paper proposes a novel framework for telehealth services that combines sensor technology and communication. This may not fit neatly into any specific sub-category and could be classified as \"other\" computer science.\n5. cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science): The paper discusses the potential benefits of the wHealth platform for managing healthcare needs within limited resources.
