The paper also mentions topics such as optimisation of bipedal locomotion and planning complex multi-agent strategies, which are related to artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and multi-agent systems (cs.MA). The use of simulations for replicable and statistically-robust research is also relevant to systems and control (cs.SY) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
