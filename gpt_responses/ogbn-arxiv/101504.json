The paper also proposes a method for reusing a holdout set to validate the accuracy of hypotheses produced by a learning algorithm. These topics are closely related to the fields of computer security (cs.CR), machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), information theory (cs.IT), and databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
