This involves optimizing beamforming vectors, quantization noise covariance matrix, and base station (BS) clustering. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), and Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-categories. Additionally, the paper proposes using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and majorization-minimization (MM) approaches to solve the optimization problem, which suggests that it could also belong to the Mathematical Methods (cs.MM) and Game Theory (cs.GT) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
