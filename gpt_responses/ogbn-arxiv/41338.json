It also involves parallel acquisition, which is related to signal processing (cs.SP) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper discusses different types of sensing matrices, which is a topic in matrix theory and optimization (cs.MM). Finally, the paper considers a specific signal model (sparse in levels), which is a topic in signal processing and image analysis (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
