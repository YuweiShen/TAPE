This involves handling uncertainties arising from sensing limitations and complexity of target object movement. Therefore, the paper is likely to belong to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category, as it deals with autonomous vehicles and their perception technology. Additionally, the paper also involves computer vision (cs.CV) techniques for object detection and tracking, and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) for heuristics rule-based filtering and probabilistic tracking. The use of probabilistic tracking also suggests that the paper may belong to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category. Finally, the paper deals with the integration of different components to achieve a specific goal, which suggests that it may also belong to the Systems and Control (cs.SY) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
