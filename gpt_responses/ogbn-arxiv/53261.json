The use of dynamic programming and Bellman's equations suggests that the paper may also belong to the category of data structures and algorithms (cs.DS). The problem of finding an optimal fusion strategy involves optimization and decision making, which are relevant to the categories of networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) and machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
