The paper also discusses the complexity of the problem, which is related to computational complexity theory (cs.CR). The use of abstract interpretation is a technique commonly used in programming languages and compilers (cs.PL), and the paper also discusses the representation of middlebox states, which is related to logic and semantics (cs.LO). Finally, the paper deals with the verification of safety properties, which is a topic in control theory and systems engineering (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
