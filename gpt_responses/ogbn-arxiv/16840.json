The paper also proposes a framework that achieves outstanding recognition performance, which involves machine learning (cs.MM) and statistical learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of physiological state on face recognition, which is related to human-computer interaction (cs.HC). Finally, the paper discusses the use of IR imaging, which is related to image processing (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
