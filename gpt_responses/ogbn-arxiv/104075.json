The paper discusses the use of bio-inspiration from statistical physical modelling of animal swarms and optimization for stable group flight in a noisy, windy, delayed and error-prone environment. These topics are closely related to the fields of robotics (cs.RO), control systems (cs.SY), machine learning (cs.MA), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and computer vision (cs.CV). Therefore, these are the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper, ordered from most to least likely."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
