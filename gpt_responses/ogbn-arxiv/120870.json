The proposed method involves transfer learning, which is a common technique used in machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) to improve the performance of models. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of dropout, which is a regularization technique commonly used in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the experiments involve the use of datasets commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research, further supporting the inclusion of this sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
