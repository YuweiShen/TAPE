This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms.\n- cs.IT (Information Theory): The paper discusses the performance of algorithms in terms of achieving optimal backlog, which is a measure of information transmission efficiency. This falls under the scope of information theory.\n- cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory): The paper discusses cup games, which are a type of game theory problem. This falls under the scope of computer science and game theory.\n- cs.MA (Multiagent Systems): The multi-processor cup game involves multiple agents (processors) interacting with each other. This falls under the scope of multiagent systems.\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper discusses the use of randomized algorithms to improve the performance of the greedy algorithm.
