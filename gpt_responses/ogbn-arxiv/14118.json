The paper also introduces a new concept, the asymptotic deployment gain (ADG), which characterizes the performance of different point processes in the high-reliability regime, which is a topic related to mathematical analysis (cs.MA) and systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper uses simulations to investigate the outage probabilities and ADGs for different point processes and fading statistics, which is a topic related to game theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
