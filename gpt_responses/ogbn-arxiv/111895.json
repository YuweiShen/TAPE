The paper focuses on the spatiotemporal features of the data and proposes a fusion convolutional network that maintains the spatial coordinates of the input and no spatial information is lost between layers. This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the sub-categories of machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), computer vision (cs.CV), social and information networks (cs.SI), and information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
