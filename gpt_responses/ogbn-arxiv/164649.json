This falls under the scope of information theory. \n2. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing): The paper discusses the use of substitute decoding for distributed computing tasks and shows its effectiveness in making power iterations robust to erasures in distributed systems. \n3. cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms): The paper uses PageRank as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of substitute decoding in solving iterative computation tasks. This falls under the scope of data structures and algorithms. \n4. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper discusses the use of substitute decoding in computing eigenvectors, truncated SVD, and gradient descent, which are commonly used in machine learning applications. \n5. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper discusses the use of substitute decoding in distributed systems, which falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
