The paper also discusses text-based image retrieval, which is a subfield of information retrieval (cs.IR). The use of deep convolutional neural networks for recognition is a common technique in natural language processing (cs.CL) and machine learning (cs.LG). Finally, the paper mentions the use of synthetic text generation for training the neural networks, which is a technique commonly used in artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
