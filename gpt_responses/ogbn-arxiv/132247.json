Specifically, the paper proposes a new measure of risk called reward volatility and develops a policy gradient algorithm to reduce it. This work is closely related to the sub-fields of machine learning such as reinforcement learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), robotics (cs.RO), systems and control (cs.SY), and multi-agent systems (cs.MA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
