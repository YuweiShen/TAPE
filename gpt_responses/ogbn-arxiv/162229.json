The paper proposes new Rademacher complexity bounds for neural networks that depend on additional data-dependent properties of the network, such as the norms of the hidden layers and the Jacobians of each layer. These properties are relevant to several subfields of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), neural networks (cs.NE), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and data structures (cs.DS). However, given the focus on deep neural networks and their sample complexity, cs.LG and cs.NE are the most likely sub-categories, followed by cs.CV, cs.AI, and cs.DS."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
