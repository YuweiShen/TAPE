The proposed method involves regularization techniques to learn noise-tolerant representations, which is a common approach in machine learning. \n2. cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition): The paper mentions the use of self-supervised rotation task, which is a common technique in computer vision for learning representations. The experiments also involve image classification tasks, which are common in computer vision. \n3. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with a problem that is relevant to artificial intelligence, specifically in the area of machine learning. \n4. cs.CL (Computation and Language): The paper does not deal with natural language processing directly, but the proposed method could potentially be applied to text classification tasks, which are common in this sub-category. \n5. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper does not deal with cryptography or security, but regularization techniques are commonly used in these areas as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
