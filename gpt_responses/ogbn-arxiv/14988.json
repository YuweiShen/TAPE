Additionally, the paper applies the proposed method to various machine learning tasks such as image classification (cs.CV), speech recognition (cs.CL), and language modeling (cs.CL). The paper also involves optimization techniques (cs.DC) such as momentum correction and local gradient clipping. Finally, the paper discusses the potential for distributed training on mobile devices (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
