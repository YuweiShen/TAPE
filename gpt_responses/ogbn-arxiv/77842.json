It also captures scheduling constraints arising in diverse modern environments ranging from individual computer architectures to data centers. The problem involves packing constraints over the set of rates of the outstanding jobs, which suggests a connection to optimization and polyhedral geometry (cs.DS). The paper also discusses competitive algorithms and competitive equilibria, which suggests a connection to game theory (cs.GT). The paper designs algorithms for minimizing total weighted completion time and total flow-time, which suggests a connection to information theory (cs.IT) and networked systems (cs.NI). Finally, the paper mentions network bandwidth requirements found in data center scheduling, which suggests a connection to control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
