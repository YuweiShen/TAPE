The proposed scheme involves coalition formation, which is a topic in game theory (cs.GT). The paper also discusses the costs and revenues associated with coalition coordination, which relates to distributed computing (cs.DC). The self-organizing behavior of the RSUs and the adaptation to environmental changes can be seen as a control system (cs.SY) problem. Finally, the paper proposes an algorithm for forming coalitions, which involves information theory (cs.IT) concepts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
