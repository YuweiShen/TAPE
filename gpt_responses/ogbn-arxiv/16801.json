This involves tasks such as localizing entities in a referring relationship and modelling predicates that connect entities as shifts in attention. These tasks are closely related to computer vision (cs.CV), natural language processing (cs.CL), and machine learning (cs.AI, cs.LG). Additionally, the paper involves searching for entities in the absence of their category, which is related to information retrieval (cs.IR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
