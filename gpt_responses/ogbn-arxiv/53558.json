This involves adapting the weights during the evolutionary process to find a suitable distribution of weights for the given problem. This approach is relevant to several subfields of computer science, including neural networks (cs.NE), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), machine learning (cs.LG), data structures and algorithms (cs.DS), and robotics (cs.RO)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
