The use of neural networks for segmentation also involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of different network structures and experiments, which could fall under multimedia (cs.MM) and neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
