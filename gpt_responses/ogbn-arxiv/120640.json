The use of the mean power-$\\alpha$ error (MP$\\alpha$E) as a performance measure suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of statistical learning (cs.SI). The analysis of the achievable and converse bounds on the MP$\\alpha$E exponent involves mathematical techniques such as optimization and probability theory, which are also relevant to the sub-categories of mathematical optimization (cs.MM) and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
