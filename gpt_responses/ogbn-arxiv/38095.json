This falls under computational geometry (cs.CG) and graph theory (cs.DS). The paper also uses techniques from discrete mathematics (cs.DM) and provides results on the worst-case spanning ratios of these graphs, which can be applied in network design and optimization (cs.SI). Finally, the paper discusses the concept of ordered graphs, which can be seen as a form of graph labeling or coloring, and provides results on their properties, which falls under graph theory (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
