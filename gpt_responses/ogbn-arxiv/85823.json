The paper also introduces a new tool, which involves a novel information flow model and a new approach for merging execution waves and API calls, indicating a focus on software engineering (cs.SE) and programming languages (cs.PL). The use of dynamic analysis and system-wide code also suggests a connection to systems and control (cs.SY). Finally, the paper's emphasis on precision and generality suggests a possible connection to artificial intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
