The focus on deriving lower bounds on the cumulative distribution function of the contact distance suggests that the paper may be more relevant to cs.IT and cs.MS, but the tractable way of bounding the effect of all the holes in a PHP could also be of interest to researchers in cs.DM, cs.NA, and cs.SI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
