This topic falls under the broad category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The use of SAT encodings and backtracking search algorithms also suggests a connection to computer science theory (cs.DS) and discrete mathematics (cs.DM). Finally, the application of these techniques to large-scale real-world networks suggests a connection to computational engineering (cs.CE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
