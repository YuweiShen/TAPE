The paper also mentions the use of deep neural networks, which is a common technique in machine learning. Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed method on real-world datasets, which is a common practice in machine learning research. \n\nThe paper also mentions the use of random projection, which is a technique commonly used in computer vision (cs.CV) and natural language processing (cs.CL) for dimensionality reduction. The paper also mentions the use of anomaly detection, which is a common task in artificial intelligence (cs.AI). \n\nFinally, the paper mentions the optimization of the representation learner, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE).
