The paper proposes a novel architecture called SPatial Awareness Network (SPANet) to incorporate spatial context for crowd counting. The paper also proposes a new loss function called Maximum Excess over Pixels (MEP) loss to address the limitations of existing methods. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.CV and cs.LG. \n\nAdditionally, the paper also involves the use of weakly supervised learning (AI) and multi-branch architecture (MM) to generate the pixel-level subregion with high discrepancy to the ground truth. Therefore, cs.AI and cs.MM are also likely sub-categories. Finally, the paper involves the use of deep learning techniques (NE) to integrate the proposed framework into existing crowd counting methods. Hence, cs.NE is also a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
