The problem being addressed is a specific type of inverse problem in computed tomography (CT), which falls under the category of information theory (cs.IT) and numerical analysis (cs.NA). Finally, the paper also discusses the use of the shearlet transform, which is a mathematical tool commonly used in multimedia processing (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
