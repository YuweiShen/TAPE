The paper proposes a new mid-level representation for shape contours and skeleton, which is likely to fall under the computer vision (cs.CV) sub-category. The paper also uses a linear SVM classifier to recognize the shape, which is a common machine learning technique and suggests that the paper could also belong to the machine learning (cs.LG) sub-category. The paper proposes a new mid-level representation, which involves encoding the skeleton paths connecting pairs of end points in the skeleton, which suggests that the paper could also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category. The paper deals with shape recognition, which involves analyzing the geometric properties of shapes, which suggests that the paper could also belong to the graphics (cs.GR) sub-category. Finally, the paper involves experimental results, which suggests that the paper could also belong to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
