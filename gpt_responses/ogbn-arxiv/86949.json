The paper also characterizes the bit sequences with the smallest and largest expected regret, which involves analyzing the information-theoretic properties of the sequences (cs.IT). The paper also discusses the regret bounds of the worst-case and best-case sequences, which involves analyzing the computational complexity of the algorithm (cs.DS). Finally, the paper extends the results to a model where false positive and false negative errors have different weights, which involves analyzing the game-theoretic aspects of the problem (cs.GT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
