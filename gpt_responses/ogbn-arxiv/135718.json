The use of memristive devices for cryptography is a relatively new and emerging topic, which could fall under the category of emerging technologies (cs.ET). The paper also discusses the use of memristive devices in near-sensor computing systems such as mobiles, drones, smart cameras, and wearables, which could fall under the category of computer architecture (cs.AR). The paper also mentions the need for developing a more concrete approach to developing memristive cryptanalysis, which could fall under the category of neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) or control systems (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
