The paper also involves optimization techniques and information theory, which are subfields of computer science that fall under the categories of cs.IT and cs.SI, respectively. The paper also discusses the interplay between WiFi connectivity and rates of links to the cellular tower, which is a topic that falls under the category of game theory (cs.GT). Finally, the paper proposes a heuristic approach to split any network, which is a topic that falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
