This involves using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from images, which is a common technique in computer vision (cs.CV). The paper also discusses the use of global average pooling (GAP) and the limitations of this approach, which is related to machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper evaluates the proposed model on four benchmarks, which involves comparing performance metrics and analyzing results, indicating a focus on multimedia (cs.MM) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). Finally, the paper discusses the potential security implications of the proposed model, which is related to cryptography (cs.CR)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
