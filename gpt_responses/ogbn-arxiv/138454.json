The paper also addresses the issue of Byzantine fault tolerance, which is a common concern in cryptography (cs.CR) and distributed systems (cs.DS). Finally, the paper presents a self-stabilizing algorithm, which is a technique used in control theory (cs.SY) to ensure that a system can recover from any transient faults."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
