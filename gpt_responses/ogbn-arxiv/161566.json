The use of system call analysis and behavioural information of running processes suggests the involvement of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and systems and control (cs.SY) sub-categories. The proposed system also involves the integration of different types of information, which could be related to software engineering (cs.SE). Finally, the use of a responsive system that adapts to new threats suggests the involvement of neural networks (cs.NE)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
