Therefore, cs.CL (Computation and Language) is the most likely sub-category. The paper also proposes data efficiency metrics, which are relevant to optimization and performance evaluation of ML models, indicating a possible connection to cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The use of Transformer, a popular deep learning architecture, suggests a possible association with cs.DL (Deep Learning) as well. Finally, the paper involves processing and releasing a large dataset of scientific articles, which could be relevant to cs.IR (Information Retrieval)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
