Therefore, the most likely category is cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms). Additionally, the paper discusses the efficiency of the library in terms of parallelism, which suggests that it could also belong to cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing). The paper also presents algorithms for various functions on augmented maps, which could place it in cs.PF (Performance). Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the library in a programming language, which could suggest that it belongs to cs.PL (Programming Languages)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
