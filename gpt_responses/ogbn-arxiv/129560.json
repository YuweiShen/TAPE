This involves generating a sequence of questions to be posed to the agent, and using the answers to derive a minimal, functionally indistinguishable class of agent models. This approach falls under the broad category of artificial intelligence (cs.AI), specifically in the subfield of machine learning (cs.LG) and robotics (cs.RO). The paper also deals with the security aspect of autonomous agents, which could place it under the subfield of cybersecurity (cs.CR) and systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
