The paper also investigates the role of spatial information in CNNs, which is relevant to machine learning (cs.LG), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and neural networks (cs.NE). Additionally, the paper evaluates its findings on several object recognition datasets, which falls under multimedia (cs.MM)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
