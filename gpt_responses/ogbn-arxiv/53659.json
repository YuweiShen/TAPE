This falls under the scope of networking and internet architecture.\n2. cs.IT (Information Theory) - The proposed coded delivery scheme involves coding techniques to reduce the number of sub-files required for backhaul delivery. This falls under the scope of information theory.\n3. cs.MM (Multimedia) - The paper specifically mentions on-demand video streaming applications and how content caching at small-cell base stations can mitigate excessive backhaul load and delay. This falls under the scope of multimedia.\n4. cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) - The proposed scheme involves distributing and storing content across multiple small-cell base stations, which can be considered as a form of distributed computing.\n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control) - The paper proposes a system architecture for cache-enabled heterogeneous cellular networks and discusses the impact of the proposed scheme on the system performance. This falls under the scope of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
