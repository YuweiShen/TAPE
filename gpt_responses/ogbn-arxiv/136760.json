The proposed method involves using an image difficulty predictor, which is a machine learning model, to optimize the trade-off between accuracy and speed in object detection. This suggests that the paper could also be categorized under artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also involves comparing the performance of different object detectors, which could fall under robotics (cs.RO). Finally, the paper uses the PASCAL VOC dataset, which is commonly used in multimedia (cs.MM) research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
