The paper also focuses on the use of transformationally identical (TI) kernels, which is a technique for improving the generalization performance of CNNs, making it relevant to machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of error-backpropagation during training, which is a common technique in neural networks (cs.NE). Finally, the paper provides C programming routines for implementing the TI-CNN technique, which could be relevant to multimedia (cs.MM) applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
