It also discusses virtualization and network function virtualization, which are IT techniques (cs.IT). The paper focuses on energy efficiency, which is a common concern in data centers (cs.DC). The use of mathematical models to compare the energy efficiency of different architectures suggests the paper could also fall under the category of applied mathematics (cs.AR). Finally, the paper proposes a framework for 5G networks, which could fall under the category of systems and control (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
