The method involves capturing unique pairwise relations with the same identity and discriminative pairwise relations between different identities using local appearance features around landmark points on the feature map. This work is related to computer vision (cs.CV) as it deals with image processing and recognition. It also involves machine learning (cs.LG) as it uses long short-term memory (LSTM) units network to obtain face identity state feature. Additionally, it involves artificial intelligence (cs.AI) as it aims to determine facial part-relational structure from local appearance feature pairs. Multimedia (cs.MM) is another possible category as it deals with processing and analyzing visual data. Finally, it may also fall under cryptography and security (cs.CR) as face recognition is often used for security purposes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
