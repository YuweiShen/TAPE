The use of indirect decoding and the establishment of inner and outer bounds suggest that the paper may also be relevant to the network information theory (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI) sub-categories. The paper may also be relevant to the communication complexity (cs.CC) sub-category, as it deals with the complexity of finding the capacity of broadcast channels. Finally, the use of satellite codewords suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
