The paper also discusses the performance of different optimal length codes in a wireless channel, which is a topic related to networked systems (cs.NI) and signal processing (cs.SI). The paper presents results on the number of optimal length index codes using an algebraic formulation, which is a topic related to coding theory (cs.CC). Finally, the paper uses a network code to represent the index coding problem, which is a topic related to distributed systems (cs.DS)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
