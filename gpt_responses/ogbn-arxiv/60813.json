This topic falls under the sub-categories of Information Theory (cs.IT), Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI), Multimedia (cs.MM), Systems and Control (cs.SY), and Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of machine learning-based beam selection algorithms, which further supports the inclusion of cs.AI as a likely sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
