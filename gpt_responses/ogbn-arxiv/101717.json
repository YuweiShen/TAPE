The notion of stability is a central concept in the paper, which is also a common theme in cs.GT. The paper also uses techniques from approximation algorithms (cs.APPROX), such as randomized rounding and iterative rounding. The problem of committee selection with preferences is closely related to voting theory (cs.DS), as it involves aggregating individual preferences to make a collective decision. The paper also discusses the implications of their results for fairness and social welfare (cs.SI), which are important topics in computational social choice. Finally, the paper uses techniques from linear programming and optimization (cs.LG) to obtain their results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
