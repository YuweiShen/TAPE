The proposed solution involves the use of deep reinforcement learning (cs.AI) to learn an obstacle-avoiding policy and a reachability estimator. The paper also mentions the use of machine learning (cs.LG) and supervised learning (cs.SY) in training these components. Additionally, the paper evaluates the method on three kinodynamic systems, which may involve computer vision (cs.CV) for perception."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
