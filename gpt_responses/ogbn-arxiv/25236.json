Therefore, cs.SE (Software Engineering) is the most likely sub-category. The tool translates Eiffel programs to Boogie, which is a language used for program verification, suggesting cs.PL (Programming Languages) as another likely sub-category. The paper also discusses object-oriented features such as polymorphism and inheritance, indicating cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) as a possible sub-category. Additionally, the paper mentions strategies to reduce the amount of annotations needed, which could fall under cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) or cs.PLDC (Programming Languages and Compilers)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
