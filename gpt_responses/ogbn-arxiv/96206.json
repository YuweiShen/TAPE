The paper also discusses the semantics of these formalisms, which falls under the category of mathematical logic (cs.LO). Additionally, the paper mentions modal formulas, which are commonly used in computational linguistics (cs.CL). The paper also touches on skeptical reasoning, which is relevant to cryptography (cs.CR).
