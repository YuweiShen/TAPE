The paper also discusses the behavior of the network under perturbations of input images. \n3. cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing): The ResNets are a type of neural network, and the paper discusses their stability analysis. \n4. cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence): The paper deals with the analysis of a popular deep learning architecture, which is relevant to the field of artificial intelligence. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper uses linearization, a common method used in the qualitative analysis of nonlinear systems, to understand the behavior of ResNets under perturbations. This is relevant to the field of systems and control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
