The proposed approach is evaluated on a dataset related to multimedia (MM) and involves tasks such as cross-modal verification, matching, and retrieval. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category is cs.MM. However, since the paper also involves deep learning techniques, it could also belong to cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and cs.LG (Machine Learning). Additionally, since the paper involves signal processing techniques, it could also belong to cs.SD (Sound). Finally, since the paper involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques for evaluating the results, it could also belong to cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
