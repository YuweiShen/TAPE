The use of finite state machines and omega-regular specifications suggests that the paper is likely to be related to the sub-category of Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO). The fact that the systems communicate via rendez-vous and the mention of Zielonka automata suggests a connection to the sub-category of Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC). The use of specifications and the goal of constructing correct systems suggests a connection to the sub-category of Programming Languages (cs.PL). The mention of control and the use of finite state machines suggests a connection to the sub-category of Systems and Control (cs.SY). Finally, the use of formal methods and the goal of satisfying a given specification suggests a connection to the sub-category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
