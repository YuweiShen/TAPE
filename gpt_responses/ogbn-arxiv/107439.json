It reviews progress in cognitive science and suggests that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends. The paper discusses the importance of building causal models of the world, grounding learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology, and harnessing compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-categories for this paper are cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), cs.LG (Machine Learning), cs.CC (Computational Complexity), cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing), and cs.CL (Computation and Language)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
