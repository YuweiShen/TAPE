It proposes an algorithm that runs in time dependent on the matrix multiplication exponent and dual exponent, which are topics in numerical linear algebra (cs.NA). The paper also introduces a data structure to maintain the central path of interior point methods, which is a topic in data structures (cs.DS). The algorithm proposed in the paper is a central path method, which is a topic in computational complexity (cs.CC) and distributed computing (cs.DC). Finally, the problem of empirical risk minimization is a topic in machine learning (cs.LG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
