The paper proposes a novel ethical framework called Augmented Utilitarianism, which is directly relevant to the subfield of AI ethics and aligns with the goals of creating safe and beneficial AI systems. The paper also discusses the need to consider embodied simulations in the design of utility functions, which is relevant to the subfield of robotics (cs.RO). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of AI and technology in the ethical framework, which is relevant to the subfields of machine learning (cs.LG) and cybersecurity (cs.CY). Finally, the paper discusses the need for dynamical ethical enhancement, which is relevant to the subfield of social and information sciences (cs.SI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
