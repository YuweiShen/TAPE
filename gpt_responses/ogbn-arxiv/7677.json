This falls under the category of \"Machine Learning\" (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper proposes a novel data scaling method that improves the learning process, which could also fall under \"Artificial Intelligence\" (cs.AI). The paper also mentions the use of data scaling in computer vision (cs.CV) and neural networks (cs.NE), which are subfields of machine learning. Finally, the paper discusses the issue of dealing with multivariate data, which could fall under \"Systems and Control\" (cs.SY)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
