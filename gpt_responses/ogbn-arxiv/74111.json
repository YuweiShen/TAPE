The paper also discusses the use of group sparsity promoting optimization, which is a popular formulation in CS. Therefore, the most likely arXiv CS sub-category for this paper is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), followed by cs.IT (Information Theory), cs.MM (Multimedia), cs.SI (Social and Information Networks), and cs.LG (Machine Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
