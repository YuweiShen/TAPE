The proposed model is based on manifold regularized robust PCA and exploits the graph smoothness assumption and clean data recovered by robust PCA. The experiments are conducted on image/document clustering, object recognition, image shadow removal, and video background subtraction, indicating that the paper is likely to belong to the following arXiv CS sub-categories: \n- cs.LG (Machine Learning)\n- cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)\n- cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)\n- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n- cs.IT (Information Theory)"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
