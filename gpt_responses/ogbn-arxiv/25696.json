The paper discusses the impact of exogenous state variables and rewards on reinforcement learning and proposes algorithms for discovering and removing them. Therefore, the most likely category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cs.RO (Robotics). The paper also involves mathematical analysis and optimization, which could place it in cs.SY (Systems and Control) or cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
