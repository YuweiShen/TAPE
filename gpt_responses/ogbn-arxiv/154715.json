The paper also proposes a new model to deal with the problem of unseen attribute types, which involves machine learning techniques and falls under the categories of artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and machine learning (cs.LG). The paper also evaluates its proposed model on a new benchmark dataset, which involves experimental evaluation and falls under the category of information retrieval (cs.IR). Finally, the paper deals with tables, which are a type of structured data, and thus falls under the category of databases (cs.DB)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
