This suggests that the paper belongs to the machine learning (cs.LG) and security and privacy (cs.CR) sub-categories. The paper also proposes a novel approach for privacy leakage avoidance, which involves ensembles of models, indicating that it may also belong to the artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and computer vision (cs.CV) sub-categories. Finally, the paper tests its approach on three calibration image datasets, suggesting that it may also belong to the data structures (cs.DS) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
