The authors explore ways to aggregate BERT outputs as video representation, which could potentially fall under the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. \n3. cs.MM (Multimedia): The paper deals with large-scale video segment classification, which is a multimedia task. \n4. cs.IR (Information Retrieval): The paper involves retrieving relevant information from videos based on their content, which is a common task in information retrieval. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): The paper proposes an ensemble of frame-level models and explores various ways to combine visual and audio information, which are machine learning techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
