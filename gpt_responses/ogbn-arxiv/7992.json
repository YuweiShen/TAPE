It also presents a benchmark for matrix-matrix multiplication to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid model. \n- cs.PF (Performance): The paper addresses the issue of achieving high performance on the Epiphany architecture, which is known for its high computational energy efficiency and parallel scalability. The proposed hybrid programming model aims to address the deficiencies of using OpenCL alone to achieve good benchmark performance. \n- cs.PM (Programming Languages): The paper proposes a hybrid programming model that combines two programming languages, OpenCL and OpenSHMEM, to provide a better solution for device-level programming on the Epiphany architecture. \n- cs.SY (Systems and Control): The paper discusses the use of the Epiphany architecture as a coprocessor in platforms that also utilize an ARM CPU host, which can be seen as a system-level issue."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
