This suggests that the paper is likely to belong to the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) sub-category, which deals with intelligent agents, reasoning, and problem-solving. Additionally, the paper discusses techniques for improving the efficiency of the heuristic, which could fall under the Programming Languages (cs.PL) sub-category, which deals with the design and implementation of programming languages and systems. The paper also mentions overcoming local optimal states, which could relate to the Robotics (cs.RO) sub-category, which deals with the design and control of robots. Furthermore, the paper discusses the performance results from various domains, which could relate to the Software Engineering (cs.SE) sub-category, which deals with the design, development, and maintenance of software systems. Finally, the paper mentions enriching the representation and reducing the size of the problem, which could relate to the Machine Learning (cs.LG) sub-category, which deals with the development of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
