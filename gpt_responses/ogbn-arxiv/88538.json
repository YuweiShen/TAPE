This is a core concept in machine learning, and the paper also proposes a novel model aggregation algorithm to improve generalizability. \n2. cs.CY (Computers and Society): The paper focuses on proactive social care and the use of the Internet and Web to provide better services to vulnerable populations. This is a key area of research in the intersection of computers and society. \n3. cs.SI (Social and Information Networks): The paper deals with social communities and the generation of large amounts of data from social services. The proposed framework aims to enable knowledge sharing among users, which is a key aspect of social networks. \n4. cs.CR (Cryptography and Security): The paper mentions the strict protection of privacy in social care, which is a key concern in cryptography and security. \n5. cs.SY (Systems and Control): The proposed framework involves multiple distributed clients and a third-party server, which can be seen as a system that requires control and optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
