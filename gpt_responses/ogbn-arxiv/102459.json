The paper proposes a method that leverages taxonomy knowledge to find semantic-similar records from two datasets. This suggests that the paper could belong to the sub-category of cs.DB (Database), which deals with the storage, retrieval, and management of data. Additionally, the paper uses techniques from information retrieval (IR) to develop a similarity measure and from computational linguistics (CL) to handle semantic relations between words. Therefore, cs.IR and cs.CL are also likely sub-categories. The paper also proposes an algorithm that selects critical parameters to maximise filtering power, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence), which deals with the development of algorithms and models for intelligent systems. Finally, the paper reports empirical experiments that show the efficiency and scalability of the proposed methods, which suggests that it could belong to the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms), which deals with the design and analysis of efficient algorithms and data structures."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
