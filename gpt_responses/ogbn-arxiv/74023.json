The use of linear network coding suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the coding theory (cs.CC) sub-category. The mention of linear-algebraic list-decoding algorithm and rank-metric codes indicates that the paper may be related to the algebraic coding theory (cs.DS) sub-category. The use of subspace codes and rank-metric codes suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the signal processing (cs.SI) sub-category. Finally, the mention of erasures and errors in networks suggests that the paper may be related to the networking and internet architecture (cs.NI) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
