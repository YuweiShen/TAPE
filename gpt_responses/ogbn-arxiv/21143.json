Specifically, the paper proposes a novel observation on the structure of the SGD noise and shows that other classes of noise distributions can also effectively regularize gradient descent. Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.LG (Machine Learning), followed by cs.NE (Neural and Evolutionary Computing) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence). The paper also mentions the application of noisy gradient descent in computer vision (cs.CV) and proposes an algorithm for generalization in large batch SGD training, which suggests a connection to the sub-category of cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
