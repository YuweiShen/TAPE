This involves optimizing the tradeoff between data quality and sensing cost, which is a problem that falls under the categories of machine learning (cs.LG), social and information networks (cs.SI), control systems (cs.SY), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), and networking and internet architecture (cs.NI)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
