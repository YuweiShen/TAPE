The paper also discusses the convergence of these algorithms, which falls under the category of machine learning (cs.LG). Additionally, the paper discusses the use of shifting experts in dynamic population games, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence (cs.AI). The paper also discusses the use of bandit feedback, which is a topic in statistics and probability (cs.DS).
