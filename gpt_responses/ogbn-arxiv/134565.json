The determinant identities are a well-known problem in linear algebra, which suggests that the paper may also be relevant to the sub-category of logic in computer science (cs.LO). The structural theorems established in the paper involve depth and size of proofs, which are concepts often studied in the context of data structures (cs.DS) and information theory (cs.IT). Finally, the paper mentions matrix identities, which are relevant to computational geometry (cs.CG)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
