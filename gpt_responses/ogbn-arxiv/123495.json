It proposes a new approach to overcome this limitation by considering universal parametric families of neural networks. This topic is closely related to several sub-categories of computer science, including machine learning (cs.LG), computer vision (cs.CV), artificial intelligence (cs.AI), neural networks (cs.NE), and natural language processing (cs.CL). However, since the paper focuses on deep neural networks and their parametrization, cs.LG and cs.CV are the most likely sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
