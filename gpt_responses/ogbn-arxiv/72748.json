Therefore, the most likely category is cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). The paper also uses OCR to extract text from the document images, which suggests that it could belong to cs.IR (Information Retrieval) or cs.CL (Computation and Language). The use of neural networks for learning from both text and image data indicates that it could also belong to cs.LG (Machine Learning) or cs.DL (Deep Learning)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
