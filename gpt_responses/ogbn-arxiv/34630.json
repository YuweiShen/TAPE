The use of prototypical concepts as side information also suggests that it may be relevant to the machine learning (cs.LG) and artificial intelligence (cs.AI) sub-categories. The incorporation of natural language semantics and the potential for zero-shot learning also suggest that it may be relevant to the natural language processing (cs.CL) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
