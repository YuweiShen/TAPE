The use of data structures and algorithms for efficient querying and indexing suggests that it could also belong to data structures (cs.DS) and information retrieval (cs.IR) sub-categories. The paper also mentions the use of computational geometry (cs.CG) for determining maximal rectangles. Finally, the mention of squared regions and the use of data structures for efficient querying suggests that it could also belong to multimedia (cs.MM) sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
