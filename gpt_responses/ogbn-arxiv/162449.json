Therefore, the most likely sub-category is cs.IT (Information Theory). The paper also involves numerical analysis and simulations, which suggests the sub-category cs.NA (Numerical Analysis). Additionally, the paper discusses applications in signal processing and wireless communications, which could fall under cs.SI (Social and Information Networks) and cs.SP (Signal Processing). Finally, the paper mentions comparisons with classical i.i.d. random matrix theory, which could relate to cs.MM (Mathematical Methods)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
