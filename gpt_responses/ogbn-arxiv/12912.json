Information theory is a likely sub-category for this paper. \n2. cs.COMM (Communications and Networking): The paper proposes low complexity equalizers for OTFS modulation, which is a communication system. Communications and Networking is a likely sub-category for this paper. \n3. cs.SI (Signal Processing): The paper deals with signal processing techniques for equalization in OTFS modulation. Signal Processing is a likely sub-category for this paper. \n4. cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture): The paper proposes techniques to improve the performance of communication systems, which is a key aspect of networking and internet architecture. Networking and Internet Architecture is a likely sub-category for this paper. \n5. cs.LG (Machine Learning): Although the paper does not explicitly mention machine learning, the proposed equalizers can be seen as a form of optimization problem. Machine Learning is a less likely sub-category for this paper, but it cannot be completely ruled out."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
