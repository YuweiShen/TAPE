Therefore, cs.LG (Machine Learning) and cs.STAT (Statistics) are the most likely sub-categories. The paper also discusses the use of Gaussian approximation and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, which are common techniques in artificial intelligence (cs.AI) and data science (cs.DS). Finally, the paper mentions minimax lower bounds and optimality, which are topics in information theory (cs.IT)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
