The use of machine learning algorithms to build a model also suggests that it could belong to cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) or cs.LG (Machine Learning). The use of labeled logs of received emails suggests that it could also belong to cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture). Finally, the evaluation of the proposed mechanism using anonymized log entries suggests that it could belong to cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
