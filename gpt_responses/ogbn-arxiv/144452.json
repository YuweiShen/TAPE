It also introduces an extension to string graphs to allow for the representation of certain infinite families of graphs and graph rewrite rules, which is related to computational complexity (cs.CC) and data structures (cs.DS). The paper also discusses the use of string diagrams in quantum information theory, which falls under the area of programming languages (cs.PL) and quantum computing (cs.QA)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
