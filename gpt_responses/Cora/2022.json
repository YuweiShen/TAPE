The convergence of these diffusions is analyzed using probabilistic methods such as exponential and polynomial convergence rates. \n\nTheory: The paper presents theoretical results on the convergence of diffusions and their discretizations. It discusses the conditions under which the diffusions converge to the given measure and how the convergence rates can be improved. The paper also compares different discretization methods and their convergence rates."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
