It provides analytical expressions governing changes to the bias and variance of the lookup table estimators and develops software that serves as an analysis tool to yield an exact mean-square-error curve. The paper also illustrates classes of mean-square-error curve behavior in a variety of example reward processes and shows that the various temporal difference algorithms are quite sensitive to the choice of step-size and eligibility-trace parameters. All of these aspects are related to reinforcement learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
