These algorithms construct classifiers that allow the \"context\" of a word to affect how (or even whether) the presence or absence of the word will contribute to a classification. This approach involves probabilistic modeling of the relationship between words and categories.\n\nRule Learning: Both RIPPER and sleeping experts construct classifiers based on rules that capture the contextual information of words. However, they differ in their methods of combining contexts and searching for a combination of contexts. The paper evaluates the performance of these rule-based classifiers on a variety of text categorization problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
