These algorithms include hidden Markov model (HMM) algorithms for multiple sequence alignment, and the MEME and Gibbs sampler algorithms for discovering motifs. The paper presents a solution to the problem of convex combinations in the form of a heuristic based on using extremely low variance Dirichlet mixture priors as part of the statistical model. The paper analyzes the problem mathematically and shows how the proposed heuristic can effectively eliminate the problem of convex combinations in protein sequence pattern discovery. All of these aspects are related to probabilistic methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
