The system learns a more efficient, problem-specific coding by identifying successful combinations of genes in the population and combining them into higher-level evolved genes. This is also a common technique used in genetic algorithms. The paper does not mention any other sub-categories of AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
