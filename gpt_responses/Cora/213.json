The methods proposed for computing bounds on the value function also involve working with the belief space, which is a probabilistic representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The control problem in POMDPs is formulated as a dynamic optimization problem with a value function that combines costs or rewards from multiple steps. The paper proposes and tests various incremental methods for computing bounds on this value function, which is a key component of reinforcement learning algorithms. The methods include novel versions of grid-based linear interpolation and lower bound methods, as well as a new method for computing an initial upper bound. The quality of the resulting bounds is tested on a maze navigation problem, which is a classic reinforcement learning task."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
