This paper belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks. The paper discusses the implementation of self-organizing feature maps using biologically plausible methods, which involve neural processes such as lateral inhibition and synaptic resource redistribution. The paper also discusses the use of similarity measures and weight adaptation, which are key components of neural network models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
