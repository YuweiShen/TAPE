The algorithm evolves a population of candidate solutions using genetic operators such as crossover and mutation. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper also uses probabilistic methods to guide the search towards promising regions of the search space. Specifically, it uses a probability distribution to bias the selection of parents for crossover and mutation. \n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm, including convergence properties and a complexity analysis. The authors also discuss the relationship between their algorithm and other optimization methods in the literature."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
