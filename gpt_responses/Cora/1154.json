The paper reviews recent literature on case-based learning and discusses alternative performance tasks and case representations.\n- Theory: The paper discusses topics in need of additional research, which implies a focus on theoretical aspects of case-based learning. Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of using more expressive case representations, which can involve developing new theoretical frameworks for representing and reasoning with cases."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
