This is a probabilistic approach to evaluating the performance of a committee of classifiers.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical approach to validating voting committees, based on the idea that it is more efficient to validate individual classifiers and use linear programming to infer committee error bounds. The paper also extends the method to infer bounds for classifiers in general, which is a theoretical contribution to the field of machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
