The algorithm co-evolves the two determinant parameters of the network's layout: the number of centroids and the centroids' positions. \n\nNeural Networks: The paper discusses the optimization of RBF networks, which are a type of neural network. The algorithm proposed in the paper uses a computationally efficient approximation of RBF networks to optimize the K-means clustering process.
