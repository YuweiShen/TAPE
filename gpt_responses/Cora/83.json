The learning scheme is based on a neural network that learns the proper actions for balancing the pole given the current state of the system and a failure signal.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper describes the inverted pendulum task as a complex control-learning problem, where the controller must learn the proper actions for successfully balancing the pole given only the current state of the system and a failure signal. The approach presented in the paper is based on reinforcement learning, where the controller learns from feedback in the form of a failure signal."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
