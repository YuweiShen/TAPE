The paper proposes a new approach to minimizing the error in these networks, which is demonstrated on a number of data-sets widely studied in the machine learning community. The paper does not discuss any other sub-categories of AI such as Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Probabilistic Methods, Reinforcement Learning, Rule Learning, or Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
