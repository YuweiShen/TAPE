The empirical component uses the PARADISE evaluation framework to provide the performance function needed by the learning algorithm. There is no mention of case-based, genetic algorithms, neural networks, probabilistic methods, rule learning, or theory in the text."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
