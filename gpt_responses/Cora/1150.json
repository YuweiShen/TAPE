The authors analyze the behavior of trained networks and compare them to other models, such as polynomial models. \n\nTheory: The paper also delves into relevant theory, outlining the reasons for practical differences in neural network training. The authors discuss the importance of excess degrees of freedom and the bias towards smoother solutions in MLPs. They also suggest future work in creating more parsimonious solutions and improving training algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
