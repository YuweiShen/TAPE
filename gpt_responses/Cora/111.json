The network uses a combination of prediction, recurrence, and time-delay connections to handle temporal variability in the signal. The paper also compares the performance of Tau Nets with and without time constants on speaker-independent tasks of vowel and consonant recognition using speech data. Therefore, the paper primarily belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
