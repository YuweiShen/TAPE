This approach provides a coherent framework for evidential and causal reasoning, and resolves problems associated with specificity, prediction, and abduction. \n\nRule Learning: The paper focuses on if-then rules and their priorities, which are automatically extracted from the knowledge base to facilitate the construction and retraction of plausible beliefs. The formalism also offers a natural way of unifying belief revision, belief update, and reasoning about actions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
