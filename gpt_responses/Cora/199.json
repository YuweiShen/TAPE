The authors also mention that their results apply to a wide class of distributions, indicating a probabilistic approach to the problem.\n\nTheory: The paper presents theoretical results on learning conjunctions with malicious noise, including a formal definition of the problem, a proof of the main theorem, and a discussion of the implications of the results. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the assumptions and limitations of their approach, which is a key aspect of theoretical research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
