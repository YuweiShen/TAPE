The approach is based on probabilistic methods, specifically Monte Carlo methods, which involve generating random samples to estimate the probability of a certain event occurring. The paper discusses the use of random sampling to generate configurations, the use of collision detection to test for collisions, and the use of probability distributions to guide the sampling process. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
