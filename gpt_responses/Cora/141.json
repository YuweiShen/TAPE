The approach involves analyzing the evolution trace, generalizing blocks to define new functions, and adapting the problem representation on-the-fly. These are all techniques commonly used in Genetic Algorithms.\n\nTheory: The paper discusses the minimum description length principle and its application to justify the feasibility of approaches based on a hierarchy of discovered functions. This is a theoretical concept that is used to support the proposed approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
