The authors use Bayesian methods to estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters and to calculate model probabilities. They also discuss the use of information criteria, such as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which are based on probabilistic principles."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
