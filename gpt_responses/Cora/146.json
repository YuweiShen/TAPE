The model consists of a layer of perceptual feature maps and a binding layer. \n\nTheory: The paper analyzes and simulates the convergence-zone episodic memory model and derives a theoretical lower bound for the memory capacity. The paper also shows why the memory encoding areas can be much smaller than the perceptual maps, consist of rather coarse computational units, and be only sparsely connected to the perceptual maps."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
