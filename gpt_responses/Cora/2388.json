The authors use a feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer and sigmoid activation function to model the time series data. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper uses a probabilistic approach to combine the forecasts of the neural networks. Specifically, the authors use a Bayesian framework to estimate the posterior distribution of the forecast errors and use this distribution to weight the forecasts of the individual neural networks. The authors also use a wavelet transform to decompose the time series into different frequency bands and apply the neural network forecasts to each band separately."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
