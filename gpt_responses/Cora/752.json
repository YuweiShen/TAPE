Additionally, the paper proposes adaptation strategies for overcoming mismatches between past experiences and new problems, which is a common challenge in case-based reasoning.\n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Rule Learning because it discusses the use of adaptation strategies for overcoming mismatches, which involves learning rules for how to adapt past experiences to new problems. Additionally, the empirical study compares the performance of different approaches, which involves learning rules for when to use each approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
