The paper suggests that an adaptive strategy employing both evolution and learning can tolerate a higher rate of environmental variation than an evolution-only strategy.\n\nGenetic algorithms are also present in the text as the paper discusses the use of evolution in the adaptive strategy. The paper suggests that combining evolution and learning can lead to better adaptation in non-stationary environments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
