The paper analyzes the evolution of the GP populations and the impact of crossover and program size restrictions on the convergence to suboptimal solutions.\n\nTheory: The paper presents theoretical models to explain the behavior of the GP populations and compares them with actual runs. The paper also confirms the basic message of a previous study and shows that evolution from suboptimal solutions to the optimal solution is possible if sufficient time is allowed."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
