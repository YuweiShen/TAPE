This is a classic topic in neural network research.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The authors use statistical methods to analyze the data and make inferences about the underlying processes.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding the dynamics of cortical activity and how it relates to cognitive processes. The authors propose a model that explains the observed phenomena and makes predictions about future experiments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
