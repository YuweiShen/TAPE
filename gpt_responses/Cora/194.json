This representation is based on probabilistic methods, as it involves classifying the trace data into different categories based on their quality and using this information to make decisions about how to improve the assembly process. For example, the authors demonstrate how end-trimming of suboptimal data can result in a significant improvement in the quality of subsequent assemblies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
