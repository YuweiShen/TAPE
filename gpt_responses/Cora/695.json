It does not focus on any specific AI sub-category such as case-based, genetic algorithms, neural networks, probabilistic methods, reinforcement learning, or rule learning. Instead, it presents a theoretical analysis of the limitations of generalisation without domain knowledge."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
