The controller can be extended with a third network: the reinforcement network. The experiments are simulated using a CAD-based contact force simulator, and the performance of the peg-into-hole task is measured in insertion time and average/maximum force level. The paper emphasizes the importance of model-free learning techniques for repetitive robotic assembly tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
