It formulates prediction as a game and shows that existing arcing algorithms are algorithms for finding good game strategies. It also proves a bound on the generalization error for the combined predictors in terms of their maximum error that is sharper than bounds to date. The paper does not discuss any specific implementation or application of AI techniques such as case-based, genetic algorithms, neural networks, probabilistic methods, reinforcement learning, or rule learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
