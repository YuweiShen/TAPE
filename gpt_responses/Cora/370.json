The method formulates a set of actions for the RL agent to ensure that exploration is conducted in a policy space that excludes most of the unacceptable policies. The paper specifically mentions the domain of motion planning as an example of applying this method in RL. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Reinforcement Learning in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
