The paper also belongs to the sub-category of Rule Learning as it proposes the use of procedural abstraction mechanisms to learn rules that can be used to generalize knowledge across different tasks. These rules are learned through a process of abstraction and refinement, which is similar to the process of rule learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
