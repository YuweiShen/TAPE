It presents a parameterized problem to model dependency and evaluates the effect of external dependency on the ability of genetic programming to identify and promote appropriate subprograms. The paper is focused on genetic programming and does not discuss any other sub-category of AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
