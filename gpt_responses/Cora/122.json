The model is based on a neural network architecture that incorporates lateral connections and feedback mechanisms, which are known to play a crucial role in visual processing. The authors use the model to investigate the phenomenon of tilt aftereffects, which are observed when the perception of the orientation of a stimulus is biased by prior exposure to stimuli with a different orientation. \n\nTheory: The paper proposes a theoretical framework for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying tilt aftereffects. The authors use the self-organizing model to test different hypotheses about the role of lateral connections and feedback in generating these effects. They also compare the model's predictions to experimental data from human subjects, providing a theoretical explanation for the observed phenomena. Overall, the paper contributes to the development of a theoretical understanding of how the brain processes visual information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
