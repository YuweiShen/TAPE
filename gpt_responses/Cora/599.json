When the visual attention is focused in the same spatial location as the auditory input, the learn signal is turned on, and the map is allowed to adapt. This is an example of reinforcement learning, where the system receives a signal (in this case, the learn signal) based on its behavior (in this case, the owl's visual attention) to adapt and improve its performance (in this case, the auditory map)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
