This ranking scheme is designed to minimize the expected completion time of the region, which is a probabilistic objective. \n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical analysis of a simplified abstract model of the problem of profile-driven scheduling over any acyclic code region, which yields the scoring measure for ranking branch instructions. The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the ranking scheme and its practicality for super blocks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
