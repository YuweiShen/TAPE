The paper also explores the strategy of finding restricted classes of action policies that can be learned more efficiently, which falls under the category of rule learning. The algorithms developed in the paper are designed to learn action maps that are expressible in k-DNF, which is a type of rule-based representation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
