The rules are interpreted as order-of-magnitude approximations of conditional probabilities, and inferences are supported by a unique priority ordering on rules. The paper also discusses causal modeling and how it can be facilitated by imposing Markovian conditions that constrain world rankings. All of these aspects are related to probabilistic methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
