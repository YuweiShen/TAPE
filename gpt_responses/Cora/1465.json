The paper extensively discusses the case representation and structural similarity measure, which are crucial problems in case-based reasoning. The experimental results and expert evaluation also demonstrate the usefulness of the system in real-world problems. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Case-Based."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
