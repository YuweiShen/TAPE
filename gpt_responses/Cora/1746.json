This paper belongs to the Theory sub-category of AI. The paper establishes the desired implication for analytic systems in several cases, studies accessibility properties of the \"control sets\" recently introduced in the context of dynamical systems studies, and provides various examples and counterexamples relating to the various Lie algebras introduced in past work. These are all theoretical aspects of AI. The other sub-categories of AI, such as Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Probabilistic Methods, and Reinforcement Learning, are not present in the text."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
