The method utilizes a notion of causal independence to further factorize the conditional probabilities and obtain a finer-grain factorization of the joint probability. The paper also presents an algorithm for Bayesian network inference that uses this factorization to find the posterior distribution of a query variable given evidence. Empirical studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the method on medical diagnosis networks. All of these aspects are related to probabilistic methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
