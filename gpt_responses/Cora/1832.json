This modification is referred to as Limited Error Fitness (LEF). \n\nRule Learning: The LEF approach involves dynamically altering the training set order and the error limit in response to the performance of the fittest individual in the previous generation. This can be seen as a form of rule learning, where the algorithm is learning to adjust its parameters based on the observed performance of the system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
