The authors explore the significance of uncertainty in the premises and conclusion of an argument, and argue that uncertainty can be incorporated into deductive arguments, but this is not reflective of human argumentation and can be computationally costly. The paper does not discuss any other sub-categories of AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
