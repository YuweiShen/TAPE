These networks represent a probability distribution over a set of visible variables using hidden variables to express correlations. Conditional probability distributions can be exhibited by stochastic simulation for use in tasks such as classification.\n\nNeural Networks: The paper presents learning procedures for stochastic feedforward networks, which are a type of neural network. The learning is done via a gradient-ascent method analogous to that used in Boltzmann machines, but due to the feedforward nature of the connections, the negative phase of Boltzmann machine learning is unnecessary. The paper also discusses the advantages of these networks over Boltzmann machines in pattern classification and decision making applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
