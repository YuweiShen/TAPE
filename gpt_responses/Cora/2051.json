The authors use a connectionist network trained with reinforcement to control both an autonomous robot vehicle and a simulated robot. They show that given appropriate sensory data and architectural structure, a network can learn to control the robot for a simple navigation problem. They then investigate a more complex goal-based problem and examine the plan-like behavior that emerges. \n\nNeural Networks is also relevant as the authors use a connectionist network to control the robot.
