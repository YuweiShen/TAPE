The paper proposes a methodology based on the Central Limit Theorem for Markov chains to assess convergence of MCMC algorithms. The paper also discusses the application fields related to these methods and theoretical convergence properties. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
