It also mentions that many of the important forms of structure require higher-order statistics to characterize, which makes models based on linear Hebbian learning or principal components analysis inappropriate for finding efficient codes for natural images. The paper suggests that maximizing the sparseness of the representation is a good objective for efficient coding of natural scenes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
