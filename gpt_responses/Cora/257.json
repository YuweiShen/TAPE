The parameters of the model are learned using the wake-sleep method, which is a probabilistic learning algorithm. The paper argues that this approach is a plausible alternative to Hebbian learning as a model of activity-dependent cortical plasticity. There is no mention of any other sub-category of AI in the text."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
