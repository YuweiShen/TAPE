This is similar to the idea of case-based reasoning, where past cases are used to inform new problem-solving. \n- Rule Learning: The paper discusses the development of algorithms to capture and reuse the rationale of an automated planner during its plan generation. This involves learning rules or patterns from past planning decisions to inform future ones."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
