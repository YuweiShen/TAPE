The approach presented in the paper involves incorporating occasional instruction from an automated training agent to improve the learning process. The experiments conducted in the paper vary the level of interaction between the trainer and the learner and a parameter that controls how the learner incorporates the trainer's actions. All of these aspects are related to reinforcement learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
