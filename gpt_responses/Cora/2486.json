It introduces the concept of a canonical distortion measure and shows how it can be calculated for different function classes. It also justifies the use of this measure by demonstrating that optimizing the reconstruction error of X with respect to the CDM gives rise to optimal piecewise constant approximations of the functions in the environment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
