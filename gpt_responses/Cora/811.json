The paper describes an implementation of a parallel genetic algorithm for this purpose. \n\nRule learning is also relevant as the focus is on learning rule-based strategies for the robots. The paper discusses the use of genetic algorithms to learn these rules and the evaluation of these rules through simulations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
