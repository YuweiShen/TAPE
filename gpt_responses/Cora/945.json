The paper also provides a simple inference mechanism for the representation via translation to Bayesian networks. \n\nTheory: The paper discusses the limitations of existing frameworks for representing complex stochastic systems and proposes a new language that supports a natural representation for certain system characteristics that are hard to capture using more traditional frameworks. The paper also suggests ways in which the inference algorithm can exploit the additional structure encoded in the proposed representation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
