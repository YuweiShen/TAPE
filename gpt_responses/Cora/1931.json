The process involves creating a population of program trees, evaluating their fitness based on user-defined criteria, and using genetic operations such as reproduction, crossover, and mutation to create offspring that are better suited to the design requirements. This process is characteristic of genetic algorithms, which use principles of natural selection and genetics to optimize solutions to complex problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
