The authors propose an anytime approach to refining the topology of these networks, which involves adding or removing neurons and connections to improve their performance. \n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for refining neural network topologies, based on the idea of anytime algorithms. The authors argue that this approach can be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge-based neural networks, and they provide experimental results to support their claims. The paper also discusses the broader implications of their work for the field of connectionist theory refinement."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
