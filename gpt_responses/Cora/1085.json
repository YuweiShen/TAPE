The paper analyzes the results obtained by different learning programs, including the AQ family of learning programs, which are rule-based. \n\nTheory is also relevant as the paper presents ideas for further research, including the development of a measure of knowledge complexity that would adequately capture the cognitive complexity of knowledge. The authors briefly discuss a preliminary measure of such cognitive complexity, called Ccomplexity, which is a theoretical concept."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
