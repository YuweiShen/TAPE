The paper introduces a methodology for solving combinatorial optimization problems through the application of reinforcement learning methods. The approach involves analyzing a set of \"training\" problem instances and learning a search control policy for solving new problem instances. \n\nProbabilistic Methods are also present in the paper, as the method based on simulated annealing is mentioned as a non-learning search procedure that is less effective than the learned search control policy. Simulated annealing is a probabilistic method for finding a good approximation to the global optimum of a given function."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
