The paper presents a generalized version of the Kushilevitz-Mansour algorithm using representations of finite groups, and introduces new classes of functions that can be learned using this approach. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
