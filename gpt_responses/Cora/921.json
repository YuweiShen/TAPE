The procedure determines a ranked set of probable causes for the degraded health state, which can be used as a prioritized checklist for isolating system anomalies and quantifying corrective action. The use of probabilities and statistical models is central to the approach described in the paper, making it most closely related to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods within AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
