These mixtures are used to estimate expected amino acid probabilities at each position in a statistical model, which improves the model's generalization capacity. The paper contains complete derivations of the Dirichlet mixture formulas and methods for optimizing the mixtures to match particular databases, which are all probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
