It introduces stochastic logic programs as a means of providing a structured definition of such a probability distribution. The paper also discusses how these probabilities can be used to guide the search in an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system and how they can be used to measure the generality of hypotheses in the ILP system Progol4.2. All of these concepts are related to probabilistic methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
