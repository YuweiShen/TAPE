The paper introduces a new tree revision operator called 'slewing' to handle numeric variables and also provides a non-incremental method for finding a decision tree based on a direct metric of a candidate tree. These techniques are all related to the process of learning rules from data, which is the focus of Rule Learning in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
