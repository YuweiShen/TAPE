The authors describe how different regions of the visual cortex are responsible for different aspects of this process, such as detecting edges and grouping objects based on their spatial relationships.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper also discusses how probabilistic models can be used to explain some of the phenomena observed in figure-ground separation. For example, the authors describe how Bayesian inference can be used to estimate the probability that a given region of the visual field belongs to the foreground or background. They also discuss how probabilistic models can be used to account for the effects of context and prior knowledge on visual perception."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
