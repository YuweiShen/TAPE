The authors use probabilistic models to represent uncertainty and to make decisions based on the available evidence. They also discuss the use of probabilistic methods in evaluating the performance of the system and in selecting the most appropriate cases for retrieval. While other sub-categories of AI may also be relevant to this paper, such as Rule Learning and Theory, the focus on probabilistic methods is the most prominent."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
