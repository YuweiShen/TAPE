The method takes solutions of a problem or a history of search and a set of background knowledge on the problem. The induced heuristics are described as rules that define a relation \"better-choice\" between operators and states. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI called Rule Learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
