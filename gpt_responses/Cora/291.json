The systems have a fixed structure corresponding to an unchanging number of \"neurons\" and are more powerful than Turing Machines but have limits on their capabilities under polynomial-time constraints. The paper also notes a precise correspondence between nets and standard non-uniform circuits with equivalent resources, which is a common topic in neural network research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
