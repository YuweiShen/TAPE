The approach involves representing cases structurally using an algebraic approach and using similarity relations to provide structure preserving case modifications. This approach enables the incorporation of generalization, abstraction, geometrical transformation, and their combinations into Cbr. \n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Theory because it relates the approach to existing theories and provides the foundation for its systematic evaluation and appropriate usage. The representation of a modeled universe of discourse enables theory-based inference of adapted solutions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
