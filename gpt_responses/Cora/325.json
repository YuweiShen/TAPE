This paper belongs to the sub-category of probabilistic methods in AI. Bayesian model selection is a probabilistic method that uses Bayes' theorem to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. The paper discusses the use of Bayesian model selection in social research, which involves modeling complex social phenomena using probabilistic models. The paper also discusses the advantages of Bayesian model selection over other model selection methods, such as hypothesis testing and model fit criteria."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
