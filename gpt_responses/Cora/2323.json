Decision-theoretic control is a type of reinforcement learning that involves making decisions based on maximizing a reward function. The paper also belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods because it discusses the use of probabilistic models for predicting the behavior of other vehicles on the road. These models are used to inform the decision-making process of the autonomous vehicle."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
