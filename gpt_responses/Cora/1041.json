The system learns from specific examples (prototypes) and generalizes to new cases based on their similarity to the prototypes.\n- Rule Learning: The paper discusses how the prototype styles of generalization can be used to provide accurate generalization for a wide variety of applications. This involves learning rules or patterns from the training data that can be applied to new cases."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
