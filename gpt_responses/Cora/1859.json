The algorithm is a form of reinforcement learning, which is a sub-category of AI that involves learning through trial-and-error interactions with an environment to maximize a reward signal. The paper also integrates the reinforcement learning algorithm directly into two commercial discrete-event simulation packages, ARENA and CSIM, paving the way for this approach to be applied to many other factory optimization problems for which there already exist simulation models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
