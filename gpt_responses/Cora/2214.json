GCV is a probabilistic method used in statistical analysis to estimate the smoothing parameter in non-parametric regression. The paper uses mathematical and statistical analysis to study the behavior of the distribution of GCV estimates near zero. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
