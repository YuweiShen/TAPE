The systematic design method developed in the paper is exemplified for the development of an adaptive force controller for a robot manipulator using neural networks. While other sub-categories of AI may also be relevant to adaptive control, the focus of this paper is on neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
