This is a common approach in neural networks, where the input space is divided into smaller regions and a function is learned for each region. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper mentions that the representations of the function at all levels (i.e., depths in the tree) are retained during the learning process, such that a good generalisation is available as well as more accurate representations in some subareas. This suggests that the method uses probabilistic methods to estimate the function in different subspaces, which is a common approach in probabilistic models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
