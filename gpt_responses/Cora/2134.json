The authors also mention the use of probability distributions to model sensor data.\n\nTheory: The paper discusses the concept of inductive bias, which is a theoretical concept in machine learning that refers to the assumptions made by a learning algorithm about the underlying distribution of the data. The authors also mention the use of minimum description length as a theoretical framework for model selection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
