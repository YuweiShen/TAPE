The authors describe how their approach involves representing design cases as structured models, and using these models to reason about similarities and differences between cases. \n\nThis paper also belongs to the sub-category of Rule Learning AI because it discusses how the authors' approach involves learning rules from past design cases, which can then be used to guide the solution of new design problems. The authors describe how their approach involves using a rule induction algorithm to learn rules from a set of design cases, and how these rules can be used to generate new design solutions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
