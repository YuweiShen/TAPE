The CMI are used as correlates of behavioral states and give better signal recognition than the raw data. \n\nTheory: The paper develops a statistical mechanics of neocortical interactions (SMNI) to describe large-scale properties of short-term memory and electroencephalographic (EEG) systematics. The paper stresses the necessity of including nonlinear and stochastic structures in this development. The paper also describes how the CMI may be used in source localization and calculates using previously ASA-fitted parameters in out-of-sample data. The paper provides a quantitative support for an accurate intuitive picture, portraying neocortical interactions as having common algebraic or physics mechanisms that scale across quite disparate spatial scales and functional or behavioral phenomena."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
