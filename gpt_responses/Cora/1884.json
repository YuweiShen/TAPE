The method involves using a network of sigmoidal functions and a gradient descent procedure to map observed hadronic kinematical variables to the quark/gluon identity. The errors are back-propagated through the network to improve the accuracy of the mapping. The paper also discusses how the neural network method can be used to identify heavy quarks and disentangle different hadronization schemes.
