The authors argue that incorporating prior knowledge and rules can improve the accuracy and efficiency of inductive learning algorithms. \n\nTheory is also present in the text as the paper discusses the theoretical underpinnings of inductive learning and the role of knowledge in this process. The authors draw on existing theories of learning and cognition to support their arguments about the utility of knowledge in inductive learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
