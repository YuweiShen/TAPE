They compare their approach with other function approximators on three reinforcement learning problems. \n\nRule learning is also present in the paper, as the decision tree is a type of rule-based model. The authors use the decision tree to approximate the optimal policy in the reinforcement learning problems they consider."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
