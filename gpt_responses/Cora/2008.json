The paper proposes a class of candidate distributions that \"self-target\" towards the high density areas of the target distribution, which improves the convergence rates of the algorithm. The paper also discusses examples of distributions with exponential and polynomial tails, and a logistic regression model using a Gibbs sampling algorithm, all of which are probabilistic models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
