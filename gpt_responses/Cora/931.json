The combination is done using a probabilistic approach, where each base classifier's prediction is treated as a vote with a certain probability of being correct. The paper also discusses the use of Bayesian methods to estimate the probabilities of the base classifiers' predictions.\n\nTheory: The paper provides a theoretical analysis of majority vote classifiers, including their error bounds and convergence properties. The authors derive theoretical results that show how the performance of the majority vote classifier depends on the performance of the base classifiers and the correlation between their predictions. The paper also discusses the relationship between majority vote classifiers and other ensemble methods, such as bagging and boosting."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
