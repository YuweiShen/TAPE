The paper discusses how GAs can be used to heuristically solve boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems and how any other NP-Complete problem can be transformed into an equivalent SAT problem and solved via GAs. \n\nNeural Networks (NNs) are also mentioned in the abstract and throughout the paper as another paradigm for solving NP-Complete problems.
