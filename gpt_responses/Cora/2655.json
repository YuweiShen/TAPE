The paper proposes an algorithm for this problem that performs an online search through the space of action mappings. \n\nRule learning is also relevant, as the algorithm proposed in the paper searches through the space of action mappings expressed as Boolean formulae. This can be seen as a form of rule learning, where the algorithm is searching for a set of rules that will lead to optimal behavior."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
