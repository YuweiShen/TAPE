This can be seen as a form of case-based reasoning, where the reasoner uses past experiences to make inferences about new situations. However, the paper does not explicitly mention the term \"case-based\" or describe any specific case-based reasoning algorithms.\n- Theory: The paper focuses on the task of hypothesis formation and hypothesis testing in the context of discovering physical principles. This can be seen as a theoretical approach to AI, where the goal is to develop general principles that can be applied across different domains. The paper discusses the representation of domain principles as device-independent behavior-function models, which can be seen as a theoretical framework for understanding physical systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
