The newly proposed class-selective rejection rule also involves probabilistic reasoning, as it aims to find an optimum tradeoff between the error rate and the average number of selected classes. The paper presents a functional relation between the recognition error and the class-selective reject function, which can be estimated from unlabelled patterns using probabilistic methods. Therefore, the paper is primarily focused on probabilistic methods for pattern recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
