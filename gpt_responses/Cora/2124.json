The parameters of the model are estimated using the expectation-maximization algorithm, which is a common probabilistic method for parameter estimation. The paper also discusses the use of probability distributions to model the data and the clusters/sub-clusters in the visualization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
