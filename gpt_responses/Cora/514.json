The paper proposes an algorithm that learns to make decisions based on the feedback it receives from the environment. \n\nTheory is also a relevant sub-category as the paper provides a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm's performance. The authors prove upper and lower bounds on the expected per-round payoff of the algorithm and compare it to the best possible performance. They also consider a setting with multiple experts and provide a strategy that guarantees expected payoff close to that of the best expert."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
