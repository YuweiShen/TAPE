These features can be seen as rules that check for the presence or absence of certain patterns in the sequence data. \n\nProbabilistic Methods are also present in the text as the paper evaluates the performance of FGEN in combination with two commonly used learning systems (C4.5 and Ripper) that are based on probabilistic methods. The accuracy of these systems is improved when the new features generated by FGEN are added to the existing representations of sequence data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
