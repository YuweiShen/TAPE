This involves using substructures or entire structures of previous concepts, which may aid in learning other concepts. The evaluation of the effectiveness of concept sharing is done with respect to accuracy, concept size, search complexity, and noise resistance, which are all probabilistic measures.\n\nTheory: The paper discusses the concept of sharing between related concepts to improve learning in the same domain. It proposes the use of substructures or entire structures of previous concepts to aid in learning other concepts. The paper also evaluates the effectiveness of concept sharing with respect to various measures, which are based on theoretical concepts."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
