The method uses Dirichlet mixture densities as priors over amino acid distributions, which are determined from examination of previously constructed HMMs or multiple alignments. The paper discusses how this Bayesian method can improve the quality of HMMs produced from small training sets and reports specific experiments on the EF-hand motif, showing that these priors produce HMMs with higher likelihood on unseen data and fewer false positives and false negatives in a database search task."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
