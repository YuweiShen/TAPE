The methods presented in the paper use large deviation theory to compute these bounds, which is a probabilistic method. The paper also discusses generic transfer function parameterizations of the conditional probability tables, such as sigmoid and noisy-OR, which are commonly used in probabilistic models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
