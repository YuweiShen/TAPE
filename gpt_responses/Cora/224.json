The method does not use explicit negative examples and instead relies on output completeness to implicitly represent negative examples. The paper also discusses two ILP systems, Chillin and IFoil, which incorporate this method and use intensional background knowledge. These are all characteristics of Rule Learning in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
