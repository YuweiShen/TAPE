These are probabilistic methods that involve calculating probabilities and likelihoods to determine the best model.\n\nTheory: The paper is based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, which is a theoretical framework for model selection. The MDL principle states that the best model is the one that minimizes the length of the description of the data and the model itself. The paper applies this principle to the selection of models in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
