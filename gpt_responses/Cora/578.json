It also presents a simple selection strategy for improving the speed of a problem solver by retaining all control rules derived from a training problem explanation. These aspects are related to rule learning. The paper also discusses the shape of the learning curve and attempts to relate domain characteristics to it, which is related to theory. The other sub-categories of AI (Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Probabilistic Methods, Reinforcement Learning) are not directly mentioned in the text."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
