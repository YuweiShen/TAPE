The Rulearner system is also capable of learning both decision lists as well as unordered rule sets. \n- Theory: The paper discusses the construction of lattices from data and examines the use of these structures in inducing classification rules. The Rulearner system is shown to compare favorably with commonly used symbolic learning methods which use heuristics rather than an explicit map to guide their search through the rule space. The paper also shows that the Rulearner system is robust in the presence of noisy data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
