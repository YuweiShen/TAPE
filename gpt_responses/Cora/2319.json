They applied a standard inductive-learning algorithm, C4.5, to a set of training data describing which constraints are active in the optimal design for each goal encountered in a previous design session. \n\nProbabilistic Methods are also present in the text as the authors mention that each reformulation corresponds to incorporating constraints into the search space. This suggests that there is a probability distribution over the possible reformulations, and the authors use the training data to learn which reformulation is most likely to be appropriate for a given design goal."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
