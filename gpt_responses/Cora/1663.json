The paper presents a new approach to constructing neural networks using genetic programming, which involves evolving the architecture and weights simultaneously without local weight optimization. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks as well."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
