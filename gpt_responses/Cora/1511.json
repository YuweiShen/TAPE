The authors propose a method for stabilizing the adaptation process by introducing a probabilistic component to the Q-learning algorithm. \n\nAdditionally, the paper also belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods because it uses probabilistic modeling to estimate the uncertainty in the Q-values and to adjust the exploration-exploitation trade-off during the adaptation process. The authors use a Bayesian approach to estimate the posterior distribution of the Q-values and to compute the expected value of the Q-function."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
