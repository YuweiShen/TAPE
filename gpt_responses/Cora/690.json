The paper also presents algorithms for pruning instances from the training set, which can be seen as a form of case selection. \n- Probabilistic Methods: The paper mentions that the nearest neighbor algorithm and its derivatives are often successful at generalization, which can be seen as a probabilistic approach to learning. The paper also discusses algorithms for reducing the number of instances retained in memory, which can involve probabilistic methods for selecting which instances to keep."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
