The authors explore the use of reinforcement learning networks to address the tuning problem and hypothesize that interacting reactions can be decomposed into separate control tasks resident in separate networks and coordinated through the tuning mechanism and a higher level controller. The paper does not discuss or mention any other sub-categories of AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
