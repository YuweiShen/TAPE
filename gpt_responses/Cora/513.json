The approach involves fitting a probabilistic model to the data and using it to cluster the points into groups representing different features. The authors also use Bayesian model selection to choose the number of clusters. Therefore, the paper is primarily focused on probabilistic methods for clustering spatial data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
