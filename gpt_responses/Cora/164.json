The network is trained to selectively sample parts of the input domain based on distribution information received from the environment.\n\nTheory: The paper discusses the theoretical concept of active learning and its advantages over passive learning. It also introduces a formalism for active concept learning called selective sampling. The authors test their implementation on three domains and observe significant improvement in generalization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
