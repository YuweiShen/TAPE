The paper also describes the use of submodules and a Pandemonium system to handle mapping tasks and decompose complex problems. The paper presents results from testing the architecture on two problem domains, including a handwritten digit problem and the parity problem. Overall, the paper focuses on the use and improvement of neural network systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
