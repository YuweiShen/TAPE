They have also tested the tuning, decomposition, and coordination of low-level behaviors using reinforcement learning. \n\nNeural Networks are also present in the paper, as the authors used separate networks for each behavior in their control system. \n\nRule Learning is also present, as the authors used a simple rule-based coordination mechanism in their control system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
