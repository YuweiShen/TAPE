This approach is discrimination-driven, where a small set of complex discriminant hypotheses are defined to serve as new concepts for redescribing the initial examples. This is a form of rule learning, where rules are learned from examples to classify new instances.\n- Case Based: The paper also discusses using the induced distance for classification via a k-nearest-neighbor process. This is a form of case-based reasoning, where new instances are classified based on their similarity to previously observed instances."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
