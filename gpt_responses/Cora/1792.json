The paper describes how the iterative modification of input data space is performed using genetic algorithms. \n\nRule learning is also present in the paper as the final classification is obtained by a weighted majority voting rule, according to the n 2 - classifier approach. The paper also discusses the subspaces of attributes dedicated for optimal discrimination of appropriate pairs of classes, which can be seen as rules for classification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
