This involves the use of probabilistic methods to handle uncertainty and variability in the data.\n\nNeural Networks: The paper mentions Daimler-Benz introducing applications such as fault diagnosis, letter and digit recognition, credit-scoring, and prediction of the number of registered trucks. These applications likely involve the use of neural networks for pattern recognition and prediction. The paper also discusses shortcomings of the applied ML-algorithms, which may include issues with neural network architectures and training methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
