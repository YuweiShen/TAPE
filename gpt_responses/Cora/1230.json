GP is a type of genetic algorithm that uses evolutionary principles to generate solutions to problems. \n\nTheory: The paper is focused on the theoretical aspect of program derivation and specification refinement. It discusses a well-known proof logic for program derivation and how it can be encoded for use in a GP-based system. The goal of the research is to determine if GP can be used to automate the specification refinement process, which is a theoretical problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
