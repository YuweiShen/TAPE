This allows for the precise measurement of the role of a clause or literal in allowing or preventing a derivation for a given example. \n\nTheory: The paper is focused on the theory revision problem for propositional domain theories and presents an approach to efficiently locate and repair flawed elements of the theory. The approach is proved to converge to a theory which correctly classifies all examples and is shown experimentally to be fast and accurate even for deep theories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
