The authors compare two approaches to learning from examples: reminding and heuristic switching. They argue that reminding is a more effective approach, as it involves retrieving similar cases from memory and adapting them to the current situation. This process is similar to how Case Based reasoning works, where past cases are used to solve new problems. Therefore, the paper is most closely related to the Case Based sub-category of AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
