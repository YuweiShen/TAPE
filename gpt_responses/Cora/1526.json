ICA involves linearly mapping the observed multivariate time series into a new space of statistically independent components (ICs), which can be viewed as a factorization of the portfolio since joint probabilities become simple products in the coordinate system of the ICs. The paper also mentions that ICA focuses on higher order statistics, which is another characteristic of probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
