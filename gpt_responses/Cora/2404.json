The authors discuss the tradeoff between guaranteed response-time reactions and flexibility/expressiveness in designing autonomous agents that deal with time and space. The model is well-suited for tasks that require reasoning about the interaction of behaviors and events in a fixed temporal horizon, and decisions are continuously reevaluated to avoid plans becoming obsolete. The authors also discuss the tradeoffs required to guarantee a fixed response time in reasoning about nondeterministic cause-and-effect relationships, and how approximate decision making processes can be used to improve expected performance. These concepts are all related to probabilistic methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
