The Bayesian approach involves obtaining a sample representing the Bayesian posterior distribution using the Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure, which combines Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. This approach is suitable for finding Bayes-optimal values of parameters in a complicated parameter space.
