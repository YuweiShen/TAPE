The paper explains their basic working mechanisms, differences from Evolution Strategies, and application possibilities. \n\nProbabilistic Methods are also mentioned in the paper, particularly in the context of Evolution Strategies. The paper emphasizes the mechanism of self-adaptation of strategy parameters within Evolution Strategies, which is a probabilistic method that allows for an on-line adaptation of strategy parameters without exogenous control."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
