The approach focuses on the ability of agents to discover information about their environment, encode this information for later use, and create simple plans utilizing the stored mental models. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI that uses genetic algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
