The paper also mentions recent work in case-based design and how generic mechanisms are one type of abstraction used by designers.\n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Rule Learning because it discusses how generic mechanisms are acquired incrementally from problem-solving experiences in familiar domains by generalization over patterns of regularity. The paper also addresses the issues in generalization from experiences, such as what to generalize from an experience, how far to generalize, and what methods to use."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
