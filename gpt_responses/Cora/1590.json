The paper also discusses the impact of seeding the population with expert strategies and the importance of maintaining genetic diversity. \n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper discusses the evolution of strategies in a dynamic environment where the algorithm is optimizing to a moving target, causing an \"arms race\" of innovation. The paper also studies the robustness of the strategies evolved and how they perform against a wide variety of opponents. The example of a population of nave cooperators being exploited by a defect-first strategy demonstrates the importance of learning from experience and adapting to changing circumstances."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
