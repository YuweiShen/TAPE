The paper proposes a theoretical model of superscalar processor performance that addresses the shortcomings of the current trace-driven simulation approach. The model views performance as an interaction of program parallelism and machine parallelism, which are decomposed into multiple component functions. The paper describes methods for measuring or computing these functions and combines them to provide an accurate estimate of performance. The paper does not mention any other sub-categories of AI such as case-based, genetic algorithms, neural networks, probabilistic methods, reinforcement learning, or rule learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
