The agent's ability to autonomously make problem-oriented modifications to the originally given representation space is due to its constructive induction (CI) learning method, which is a type of rule learning. The paper also discusses the architecture for a CI-based learning agent and gives an empirical comparison of a CI and selective induction (SI) for a set of six abstract domains involving DNF-type descriptions, which is a theoretical analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
