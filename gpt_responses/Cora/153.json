The robot's task is to learn the \"meaning\" of pictograms in order to \"survive\" in a maze. The paper discusses the difficulty of building visual categories dynamically while associating them with movements. The authors propose to use their algorithm on a simulation to test it exhaustively and compare it to an adapted version of the Q-learning algorithm. The paper concludes by showing the limitations of approaches that do not take into account the intrinsic complexity of reasoning based on image recognition. All of these aspects are related to Reinforcement Learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
