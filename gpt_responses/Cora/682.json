The algorithm described in the paper is designed to spend less time evaluating poor parameter settings and more time honing its estimates in the most promising regions of the parameter space, which is a key aspect of reinforcement learning.\n\nProbabilistic Methods are also present in the text as the algorithm described in the paper is a racing algorithm for continuous optimization problems. This algorithm uses probabilistic methods to estimate the most promising regions of the parameter space and to determine which parameter settings to evaluate next."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
