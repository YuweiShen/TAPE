The paper also mentions traditional reinforcement learning failing in complex, partially observable environments. \n\nProbabilistic methods are present in the text as the success-story algorithm (SSA) uses backtracking to undo those bias shifts that have not been empirically observed to trigger long-term reward accelerations (measured up until the current SSA call). The paper also mentions plugging in a wide variety of learning algorithms, including a novel, adaptive extension of Levin search and a method for embedding the learner's policy modification strategy within the policy itself (incremental self-improvement), which may involve probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
