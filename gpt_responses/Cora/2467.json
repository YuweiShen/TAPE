This is a probabilistic approach to learning and reasoning.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper discusses the interaction with the world supplying the learner with partial information, which can be seen as a form of reinforcement learning.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a framework for Learning to Reason, which combines the study of Learning and Reasoning into a single task. The paper also discusses the tradeoff between learnability, the strength of the oracles used in the interface, and the range of reasoning queries the learner is guaranteed to answer correctly, which is a theoretical consideration."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
