The framework involves acquiring knowledge from past cases, iteratively revising schedules based on this knowledge, and using reactive repair techniques to handle unexpected events. This approach is characteristic of Case-Based reasoning, which involves solving new problems by adapting solutions from similar past cases."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
