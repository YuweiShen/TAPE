The algorithm described in the paper is a distributed message-passing algorithm for computing marginals of a global function, which is a common technique in probabilistic inference.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a general algorithm for computing marginals in factor graphs, which can be applied to a wide variety of specific algorithms developed in different fields. The paper also discusses how factor graphs subsume many other graphical models, which is a theoretical result."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
