The Q-learning network used to solve the inverted pendulum problem is also a type of reinforcement learning. \n\nNeural networks are also relevant, as the modified RAN uses hidden units that continue to learn via back-propagation after being restarted. The Q-learning network is also a type of neural network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
