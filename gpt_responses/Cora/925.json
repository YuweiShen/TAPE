This implies the use of probabilistic methods to learn values for the free parameters.\n\nRule Learning: The paper describes a new divide-and-conquer approach in which subsets of the parameters are calibrated while others are held constant. This approach succeeds because it is possible to select training examples that exercise only portions of the model. This implies the use of rule learning to optimize the calibration process."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
