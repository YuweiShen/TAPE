These factors are probabilistic in nature, and the selection process involves choosing the simplest model that meets the needs of the hillclimbing algorithm. This is a probabilistic approach to model selection.\n\nRule Learning: The paper describes a technique called \"Gradient Magnitude Model Selection\" (GMMS), which selects the simplest model that meets the needs of the hillclimbing algorithm. This is a rule-based approach to model selection, where the rules are based on the needs of the hillclimbing algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
