These experts are neural networks that are trained to predict the next value of the time series given the previous values.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The trained experts are then used in a hidden Markov model that allows for the modeling of drifts. The hidden Markov model is a probabilistic method that models the probability of transitioning from one mode to another and the probability of observing a particular value given the current mode."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
