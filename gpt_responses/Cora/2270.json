The authors explain the architecture of the neural network and how it is trained to generate realistic images of handwritten digits. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The generative model used in the paper is based on a probabilistic framework, where the model learns the probability distribution of the input data and generates new samples based on this distribution. The authors explain how the model is trained using maximum likelihood estimation and how it can be used for digit recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
