The approach is based on a maximum likelihood framework, which is a probabilistic method for estimating parameters of a statistical model. The paper also mentions normally distributed target noise, which is a probabilistic assumption commonly used in regression models. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Probabilistic Methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
