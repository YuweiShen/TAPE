CABINS creates an initial model of the optimization task through task structure analysis, and then specializes generic vocabularies into case feature descriptions for application problems. The framework improves the model through the accumulation of cases. \n- Rule Learning: While the paper does not explicitly mention rule learning, CABINS can be seen as a form of rule learning, as it creates rules for optimizing solutions based on past cases. The framework iteratively revises the model through case-based reasoning, accumulating knowledge and improving the rules for future optimization tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
