The network consists of multiple layers of neurons that are trained using backpropagation algorithm. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper uses a probabilistic approach to recognize digit strings by modeling the probability distribution of the input data. The authors use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to model the temporal dependencies between the digits in a string. The HMM is trained using the Baum-Welch algorithm, which is a probabilistic method for estimating the parameters of a hidden Markov model."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
