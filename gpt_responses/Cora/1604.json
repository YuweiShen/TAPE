The focus is on theoretical analysis and comparison of the different techniques, rather than on the application of AI methods. While some of the techniques may involve AI methods (such as neural networks for modeling the nonlinearities), the paper does not focus on the use or development of these methods. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
