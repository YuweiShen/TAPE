HMMs are a type of probabilistic model commonly used in bioinformatics for sequence analysis. The paper discusses the design and training of separate HMM modules for specific regions of DNA, and the integration of these modules into a biologically feasible topology. The resulting HMM system, called VEIL, is tested on a set of eukaryotic DNA sequences and achieves high accuracy in gene structure prediction. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
