The confidence information gathered from the dynamic branch prediction state tables is also used to determine whether dual path execution or branch prediction should be used, which is another example of probabilistic reasoning.\n\nRule Learning: The paper proposes a hybrid branch predictor scheme that uses a limited form of dual path execution along with dynamic branch prediction. The confidence mechanism used to determine whether dual path execution or branch prediction should be used is based on a set of rules that take into account the confidence information gathered from the dynamic branch prediction state tables. Therefore, the paper involves the use of rule learning to improve the performance of the branch predictor."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
