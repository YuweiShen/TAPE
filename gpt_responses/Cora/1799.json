This paper belongs to the sub-category of Genetic Algorithms. The paper studies the performance of six algorithms in NK-landscapes with low and high dimension while keeping the amount of epistatic interactions constant. The algorithms studied include standard genetic algorithms employing crossover or mutation, and genetic local search algorithms. The paper evaluates the performance of these algorithms in high-dimensional landscapes, indicating the importance of considering high-dimensional landscapes for evaluating the performance of evolutionary algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
