The paper also discusses biasing the learning method, which is a common technique in rule learning. \n\nTheory is present in the text as the paper discusses the inductive learning problem and how inductive learning algorithms bias their learning method. The paper also presents a transference bias and discusses how it can be utilized to learn multiple concepts. The paper provides preliminary empirical evaluation to show the effects of biasing previous information on noise-free and noisy data, which is a theoretical approach to evaluating the effectiveness of the algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
