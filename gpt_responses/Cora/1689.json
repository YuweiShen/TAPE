This involves the use of genetic algorithms to evolve the neural networks that control the robots' behavior.\n\nNeural Networks: The paper specifically mentions the use of artificial neural networks to control the wandering behavior of the robots. The evolved neural networks are used to determine the robots' movements and actions.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The task given to the robots is to touch as many squares in a grid as possible during a fixed period of time. This is a form of reinforcement learning, where the robots receive feedback in the form of a score based on their performance. The neural networks are evolved to maximize this score, which is a form of reinforcement learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
