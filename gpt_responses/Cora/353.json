The conclusion states that neural networks are an attractive alternative to traditional statistical techniques when dealing with medical detection and classification tasks.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper mentions the use of a statistical method, i.e., discriminant analysis, which is a probabilistic method. The investigation was performed on the basis of a previously selected set of acoustic and image texture parameters, which were used to generate additional but independent data with identical statistical properties. The generated data were used for training and test sets, and the final test was made with the original patient data as a validation set. The use of generated data for training the networks and the discriminant classifier has been shown to be justified and profitable."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
