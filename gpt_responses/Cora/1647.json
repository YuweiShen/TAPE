For example, the meta-learner in the proposed model identifies potential contextual clues based on probabilistic reasoning.\n\nRule Learning: The paper presents a two-level learning model, where the base level learner performs regular on-line learning and classification, while the meta-learner identifies potential contextual clues. This meta-learner can be seen as a rule learner, as it learns to recognize certain patterns or attributes that indicate a change in context."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
