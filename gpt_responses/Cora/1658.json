The authors use a probabilistic model to estimate the probability of misclassification and incorporate it into their learning algorithm.\n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Rule Learning because the authors propose a rule-based approach to learning one-dimensional geometric patterns. They use a set of rules to generate candidate patterns and evaluate them based on their ability to fit the observed data. The authors also use a rule-based approach to handle misclassification noise, by modifying the rules to account for the possibility of misclassification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
