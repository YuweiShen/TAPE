This can be seen as a form of reinforcement learning, where the robots receive feedback from the environment (the graph) and adjust their behavior accordingly.\n\nTheory: The paper presents theoretical results on the expected time complexity of the learning algorithms, and characterizes the efficiency of the random-walk algorithm in terms of the conductance of the graph. The paper also introduces a new type of homing sequence for two robots, which is a theoretical contribution."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
