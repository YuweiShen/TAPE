The paper also mentions influence diagrams, which are a type of probabilistic graphical model.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a definition of cause and effect in terms of decision-theoretic primitives, providing a theoretical foundation for causal reasoning. The paper also discusses the relationship between different representations of cause and effect, such as Pearl's representation and canonical form, and how they facilitate counterfactual reasoning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
