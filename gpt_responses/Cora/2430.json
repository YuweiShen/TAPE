The algorithm proposed in the paper is adapted from the dual control literature and uses stochastic dynamic programming, which is a common approach in reinforcement learning. The paper also mentions the reinforcement learning assumption that aggressive exploration should be encouraged, but addresses the converse case in which the system has to reign in exploration."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
