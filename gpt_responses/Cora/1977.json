This involves probabilistic methods such as analyzing the probability of remaining in the current state and rejection probabilities. The paper does not discuss any other sub-categories of AI such as Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Rule Learning, or Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
