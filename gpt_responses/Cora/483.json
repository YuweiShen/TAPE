The algorithm is designed to find feasible paths or trajectories to goal regions in high dimensional spaces and has been tested on various simulated problems. The paper does not mention any other sub-categories of AI such as Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Probabilistic Methods, Rule Learning, or Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
