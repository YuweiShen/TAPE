The presented framework is well suited to classification problems in which concept descriptions depend upon numerical features of the data. The paper discusses a method to translate a set of classification rules into neural computation units and algorithms to refine network weights on structured data. \n\nRule Learning: The paper discusses a method to translate a set of classification rules into neural computation units. The classification theory to be refined can be manually handcrafted or automatically acquired by a symbolic relational learning system able to deal with numerical features. The primary goal is to bring into a neural network architecture the capability of dealing with structured data of unrestricted size, by allowing to dynamically bind the classification rules to different items occurring in the input data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
