The only feedback to the control system is a binary-valued external reinforcement signal, which indicates whether or not a collision has occurred.\n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks as an adaptive quantisation scheme is introduced, through which the discrete division of input space is built up from scratch by the system itself. This involves adding and removing neurons to the neural network as needed to improve the system's performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
