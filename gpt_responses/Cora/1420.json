The authors also reference previous research on case-based reasoning in design. \n\nRule Learning: The paper discusses the use of rules and heuristics in design, such as the use of design patterns and guidelines. The authors also discuss the importance of learning and adapting rules based on feedback and experience. \n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding creativity in design, drawing on concepts from cognitive psychology and philosophy. The authors also discuss the role of theory in guiding and evaluating design practices."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
