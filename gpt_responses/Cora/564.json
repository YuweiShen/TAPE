The paper presents a new function approximator based on soft state aggregation, a theory of convergence for RL with soft state aggregation, and a heuristic adaptive state aggregation algorithm. \n\nTheory is also a relevant sub-category, as the paper presents new theoretical results on RL with soft state aggregation, including a convergence proof and an intuitive understanding of the effect of state aggregation on online RL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
