The proposed market-based approach involves agents betting on uncertain events, which is a probabilistic method of aggregating beliefs. \n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for belief aggregation through a market-based approach. It discusses the properties of the aggregate probability and its relationship with independently motivated techniques. The paper also argues that the proposed approach provides a decision-theoretic foundation for expert weights often used in centralized pooling techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
