The paper also emphasizes the importance of maintaining a connection between a rule and the set of examples explained by the rule. \n\nTheory is also relevant as the objective of the research is to make the modification of a domain theory analogous to the use of a spread sheet. The paper describes the development of a prototype knowledge acquisition tool, FOCL-1-2-3, to evaluate the approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
