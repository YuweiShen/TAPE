The parameter estimation is carried out using an EM algorithm, which is a common probabilistic method for estimating parameters in statistical models. The paper also discusses relations with certain classes of stochastic feedforward neural networks, but this is not the main focus of the paper. Therefore, while Neural Networks may be a related sub-category, it is not as closely related as Probabilistic Methods. The other sub-categories (Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning, Rule Learning, Theory) are not present in the text."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
