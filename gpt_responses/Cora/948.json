Neural Networks: The paper presents one of the constructions of controllers in terms of a \"neural-network type\" one-hidden layer architecture. \n2. Theory: The paper presents a general result on the stabilization of linear systems using bounded controls, without any specific application or implementation. It discusses the necessary conditions for stabilization and presents two different constructions of controllers. Therefore, it belongs to the sub-category of Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
