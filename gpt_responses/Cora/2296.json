The paper discusses techniques for reducing the disruption of superior building blocks in genetic algorithms, which suggests that the focus of the paper is on improving the performance of genetic algorithms. While other sub-categories of AI may be relevant to genetic algorithms, such as neural networks or probabilistic methods, they are not mentioned in the title or abstract and do not appear to be the primary focus of the paper. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Genetic Algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
