The techniques mentioned, such as Occam's Window and Bayesian Random Searching, are all probabilistic in nature and involve making probabilistic assumptions about the data and the models being considered. The paper does not mention any other sub-categories of AI, such as Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Rule Learning, or Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
