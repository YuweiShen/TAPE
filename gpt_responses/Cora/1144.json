The architecture incorporates a preprocessor and a supervised incremental learning system, both of which are common components of neural networks. The paper also compares the properties of the nodes in VIEWNET with those of cells in monkey inferotemporal cortex, which is a common approach in neural network research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
