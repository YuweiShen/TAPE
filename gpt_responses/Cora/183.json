This approach automatically extracts knowledge from prior layouts to support design tasks, determines the similarity of complex case representations in terms of adaptability, and allows for incremental knowledge acquisition and user support. Therefore, it belongs to the sub-category of Case Based AI. Additionally, the paper heavily focuses on the use of analogical reasoning in the Conceptual Analogy approach, making it relevant to the sub-category of Analogical Reasoning AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
