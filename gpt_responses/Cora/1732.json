RBFN is a type of neural network that uses radial basis functions as activation functions. The paper proposes a method to improve the performance of RBFN by learning center locations.\n\nAdditionally, the paper also involves Reinforcement Learning as it discusses the use of a reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the center locations of the RBFN. The algorithm is used to find the optimal center locations that minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
