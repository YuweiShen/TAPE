Bayesian methods are a type of probabilistic method that use prior knowledge and data to make probabilistic inferences about unknown parameters. The authors use Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate the spatial distribution of disease rates and identify clusters and discontinuities. They also use Bayesian model selection to compare different models and choose the best one. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
