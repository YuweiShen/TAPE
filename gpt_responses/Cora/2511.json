The paper does not use any AI techniques such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, or reinforcement learning. It is purely a theoretical algorithm based on graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI called Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
