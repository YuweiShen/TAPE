The models used need to be probabilistic in nature, and the output of a model has to be a probability distribution, not just a set of numbers. The approach is based on a two-phase unsupervised learning process, and the overfitting problem common to many traditional learning approaches can be avoided, as the learning process automatically regulates the complexity of the model."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
