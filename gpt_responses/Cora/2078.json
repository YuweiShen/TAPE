The methods produce structured descriptions of reachable states that can be used to reduce the size of the MDP and make it easier to solve.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper is concerned with the solution of Markov decision processes (MDPs), which are a common framework for modeling decision-making problems in reinforcement learning. The algorithms developed in the paper are designed to make the solution of MDPs more feasible by reducing their size and complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
