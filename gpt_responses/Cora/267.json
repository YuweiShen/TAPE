This paper belongs to the sub-category of AI theory as it focuses on proving learnability results in the PAC model for classes of functions in the presence of noisy and incomplete data. The authors define a new complexity measure on statistical query learning algorithms and show that a restricted view SQ algorithm for a class is a general sufficient condition for learnability in both the models of attribute noise and covered (or missing) attributes. They also give lower bounds on the number of examples required for learning in the presence of attribute noise or covering. The paper does not discuss any other sub-categories of AI such as case-based, genetic algorithms, neural networks, probabilistic methods, reinforcement learning, or rule learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
