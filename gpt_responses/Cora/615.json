They introduce new classes of adversaries and give efficient algorithms for learning to play penny-matching and contract. \n\nTheory is also present in the paper as the authors expand the scope of research on playing games against finite automata and give the most powerful positive result to date for learning to play against finite automata. They also introduce new notions of games against recent history adversaries and statistical adversaries."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
