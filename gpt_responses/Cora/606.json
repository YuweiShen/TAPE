The experiments and analysis are centered around this type of algorithm and its numerical and parallel efficiency. While other sub-categories of AI may be involved in the implementation or application of the algorithm, genetic algorithms are the primary focus of the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
