The paper then quantifies this bias and demonstrates how unbiased ranking experiments should be conducted. This falls under the sub-category of Rule Learning, which deals with the induction of rules from data. Additionally, the paper presents a theoretical analysis of the bias in the ranking process, which falls under the sub-category of Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
