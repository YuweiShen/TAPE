The approach is based on deriving inequalities from the two Riccati differential equation solution to the finite horizon H 1 problem and exploiting the resulting freedom to construct controllers that satisfy a new robust performance condition. The paper does not mention any specific AI techniques such as case-based reasoning, genetic algorithms, neural networks, probabilistic methods, reinforcement learning, or rule learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
