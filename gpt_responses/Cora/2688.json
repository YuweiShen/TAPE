The MAX problem is used as an example to demonstrate the interaction between Crossover and a restriction on tree depth. \n- Theory: The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the interaction between Crossover and a restriction on tree depth, using the MAX problem as a case study. The authors derive formulas and proofs to explain the behavior of the algorithm under different conditions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
