The Boltzmann chains contain hidden Markov models (HMMs) as a special case. \n\nNeural Networks: The paper introduces Boltzmann chains as a new architecture for modeling time series data, which addresses some of the shortcomings of HMMs. The paper also discusses two new architectures: parallel chains and looped networks, and shows how to implement the Boltzmann learning rule exactly, in polynomial time, without resort to simulated or mean-field annealing. \n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for modeling time series data using Boltzmann chains and hidden Markov models. The paper also discusses the exact decimation procedures from statistical mechanics that are used to implement the Boltzmann learning rule."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
