The systems describe a process where random matings occur between parental chromosomes via a mechanism known as \"crossover\": i.e., children inherit pieces of genetic material from different parents according to some random rule. The paper develops a general technique for computing the expected value of the number of generations required for a population to reach a certain state, which is a fundamental problem in genetic algorithms. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Genetic Algorithms in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
