The paper describes how the algorithm adapts the problem representation by extending the set of terminals and functions with a set of evolvable subroutines, which is a common approach in genetic programming. The paper also discusses how the algorithm supports subroutine creation and deletion based on differential parent-offspring fitness and block activation, which are key concepts in genetic algorithms. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Genetic Algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
