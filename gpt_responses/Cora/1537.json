The system refines its understanding of the domain by filling in gaps in these explanations, elaborating the explanations, or learning new indices for the explanations. This process is similar to how a case-based reasoning system retrieves past cases to solve new problems.\n\nThis paper also belongs to the sub-category of Rule Learning because it describes how the reasoner can improve its understanding of a domain by reasoning about a new situation, filling in gaps in its knowledge base, and gradually evolving a better understanding of the domain. The system uses past explanations stored in memory to build explanations for novel situations, and it refines its understanding of the domain by learning new indices for the explanations. This process is similar to how a rule learning system learns new rules from examples."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
