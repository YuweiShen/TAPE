The resulting behavior can be deterministic, binary stochastic, or continuous stochastic. The paper also describes how \"slice sampling\" can be used for inference and learning in top-down networks of these units. \n\nNeural Networks: The paper proposes a simple unit that adds Gaussian noise to its input before passing it through a sigmoidal squashing function. These units can be used to model latent structure that explains correlations among observed variables. The paper also demonstrates learning on two simple problems using these units."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
