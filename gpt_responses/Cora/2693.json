The paper also discusses the optimal scaling of the proposal distribution, which is a probabilistic method for generating candidate samples in the Metropolis algorithm. The results are proved in the framework of a weak convergence result, which is a probabilistic method for studying the behaviour of stochastic processes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
