The paper analyzes the representation error and generalization error, which are components of the total approximation error, and investigates the approximation accuracy of a feedforward network as a function of the number of hidden units and learning samples. \n\nTheory: The paper introduces an asymptotical model of the error function (AMEF) based on the asymptotical behavior of the approximation error. The paper also analyzes an alternative model of the error function that includes theoretical results about general bounds of approximation. The paper uses these models in combination with knowledge about the computational complexity of the learning rule to find an optimal learning set size and number of hidden units resulting in a minimum computation time for a given desired precision of the approximation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
