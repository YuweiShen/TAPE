The probabilities of following different subtrees are learned by the system, which is a key characteristic of probabilistic methods.\n\nNeural Networks: The paper mentions that Decision Trees are relatively much faster to build as compared to Neural Networks. However, the paper also discusses the use of Probabilistic Option Trees, which can be seen as a combination of Decision Trees and Neural Networks. The system learns the probabilities of following different subtrees, which is similar to how Neural Networks learn the weights of different connections."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
