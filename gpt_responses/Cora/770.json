The paper presents a neural net architecture that can discover hierarchical and recursive structure in symbol strings. The architecture has only one layer of modifiable weights, allowing for a straightforward interpretation of its behavior. The paper also discusses the difficulty of extracting multilevel structure from complex, extended sequences, which is a problem that has been studied by other researchers in the field of neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
