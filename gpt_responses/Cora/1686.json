The paper discusses the main characteristics of ACL and illustrates its potential in addressing several problems in ILP. The paper also develops an algorithm for ACL and integrates it with an abductive proof procedure for Abductive Logic Programming (ALP). The paper investigates the particular role of integrity constraints in ACL and shows how ACL is a hybrid learning framework that integrates the explanatory and descriptive settings of ILP."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
