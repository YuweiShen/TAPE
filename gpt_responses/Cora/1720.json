The paper discusses the operations of generalization and specialization, which are fundamental to ILP. \n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Theory because it provides a systematic treatment of the existence or non-existence of least generalizations and greatest specializations of finite sets of clauses in different ordered languages. The paper surveys results obtained by others and contributes some new results, which are based on theoretical analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
