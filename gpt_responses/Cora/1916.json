The model is based on the self-organization of afferent and lateral connections in cortical maps. \n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding cortical plasticity and suggests techniques to hasten recovery following sensory cortical surgery. The LISSOM model predicts that adapting lateral interactions are fundamental to cortical reorganization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
