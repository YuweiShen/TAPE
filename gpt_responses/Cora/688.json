These networks allow for knowledge transfer across different environments the robot will face over its lifetime. COLUMBUS' models represent both the expected reward and the confidence in these expectations. \n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper mentions that COLUMBUS' task is to explore and model the environment efficiently while avoiding collisions with obstacles. Exploration is achieved by navigating to low confidence regions. An efficient dynamic programming method is employed in the background to find minimal-cost paths that, executed by the robot, maximize exploration."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
