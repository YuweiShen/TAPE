The paper also introduces a metric on stochastic process models of evolution and presents a simple and efficient algorithm for inverting the stochastic process of evolution.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a result on the PAC-learnability of the class of distributions produced by tree-like processes and establishes a lower-bound convergence rate for the algorithm. The paper also discusses the computational intractability of MLE methods and presents the first polynomial-time algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to the correct tree."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
