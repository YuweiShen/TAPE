The authors note that in nature, there may be a penalty for doing the same thing as one's parents, and they experiment with adding such a penalty to the fitness function. They also replace the static fitness function with randomly generated dynamic test cases, which is another aspect of reinforcement learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
