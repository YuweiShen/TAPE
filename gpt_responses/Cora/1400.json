The authors also use Bayesian model averaging to account for model uncertainty.\n\nTheory: The paper presents theoretical results on the estimation and approximation error bounds for model selection. The authors derive upper bounds on the expected estimation error and approximation error, which can be used to guide the selection of the best model. The paper also discusses the trade-off between model complexity and generalization performance, which is a fundamental problem in machine learning theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
