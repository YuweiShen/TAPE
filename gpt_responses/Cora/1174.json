The program forms hypotheses about the concept being learned and tests the hypotheses by asking the trainer questions. The program determines which objects in the example belong to concepts stored in the memory. A description of the new concept is formed by using the information obtained from the memory to generalize the description of the training example. The generalized description is tested when the program constructs new examples and shows these to the trainer, asking if they belong to the target concept. This process involves the use of rules to generalize and test hypotheses about the new concept being learned. Therefore, the sub-category of AI that this paper belongs to is Rule Learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
