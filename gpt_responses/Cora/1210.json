It also mentions the retrieval of past cases to generate solutions for actual problems.\n- Rule Learning: The paper presents a general approach to structural similarity assessment and adaptation, which involves limited domain knowledge to support design tasks. This approach can be seen as a form of rule learning, where rules are derived from past cases to generate adapted solutions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
