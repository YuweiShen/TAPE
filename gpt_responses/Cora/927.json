The authors state that their approach is \"exemplar-based\" and they use a database of previously annotated music pieces to train their system.\n\nThis paper also belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks because the authors use a specific type of neural network called a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to cluster the exemplars and recognize the structure of new music pieces. The authors explain how the SOM works and how they use it in their system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
