The IGGNN is a type of unsupervised neural network that learns the structure of the data by growing a grid of neurons in an incremental manner. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper uses a probabilistic approach to model the uncertainty in the data. The IGGNN uses a Gaussian mixture model to estimate the probability density function of the data, which is used to assign each data point to a neuron in the grid. The paper also uses a probabilistic measure called the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to determine the optimal number of neurons in the grid."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
