The paper also presents a theory of incremental learning based on the revision of previously existing case knowledge in response to experiences in novel situations, which complements work in case-based reasoning by providing mechanisms for building a case library. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Case Based. Additionally, the paper presents a theory of incremental learning, which can be considered a theoretical aspect of AI, placing it in the sub-category of Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
