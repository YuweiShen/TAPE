The study also looks at the effects of increasing nonlinearity of functions on the convergence behavior of a simple genetic algorithm. While other sub-categories of AI may be indirectly related to the study, genetic algorithms are the primary focus and the most relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
