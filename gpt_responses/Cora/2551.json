The paper also proposes the idea that knowledge can sometimes have a negative value and that research into knowledge acquisition should take seriously the possibility that knowledge may sometimes be harmful. The paper concludes that learning and forgetting are complementary processes which construct and maintain useful representations of experience."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
