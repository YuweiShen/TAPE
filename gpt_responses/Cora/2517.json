The theory is based on neural mechanisms that construct and update object representations through the interactions of attentional mechanisms, preattentive grouping mechanisms, and an associative memory structure.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for solving the temporal binding problem in visual perception. The proposed theory is based on neural mechanisms and provides a unified quantitative explanation of results from psychophysical experiments on object review, object integration, and multielement tracking."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
