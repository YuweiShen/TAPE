The paper explains how genetic algorithms can be used to optimize the selection of tactics and the allocation of resources in a military scenario. The paper also discusses the use of fitness functions and crossover and mutation operators in the genetic algorithm.\n\nThis paper also belongs to the sub-category of Reinforcement Learning because it discusses the use of reinforcement learning to improve tactical plans.
