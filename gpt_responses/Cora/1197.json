The paper then tests two alternative explanations for why bagging works, both based on Bayesian learning theory. The paper concludes that bagging works because it effectively shifts the prior to a more appropriate region of model space. The use of Bayesian learning theory and probability concepts throughout the paper makes it clear that it belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
