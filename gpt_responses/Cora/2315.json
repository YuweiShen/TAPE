This involves using probability distributions to model the data and make predictions. \n\nTheory: The paper uses mathematical analysis to derive an asymptotic characterization of the minimax risk in terms of the metric entropy properties of the class of distributions that might be generating the examples. It also uses the concept of Assouad density to characterize the minimax risk in the special case of noisy two-valued classification problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
