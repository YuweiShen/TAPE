This process is similar to the reinforcement learning paradigm where an agent learns to take actions based on feedback from the environment. \n\nRule Learning is present in the paper as the computer implementation of the `Truth from Trash' model has been used to enhance the strategic abilities of a simulated, football playing mobot. This involves learning rules or strategies based on the feedback received from the environment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
