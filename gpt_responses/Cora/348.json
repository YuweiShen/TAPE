The algorithm employs a covering approach (beam search), a heuristic impurity function, and stopping criteria based on local improvement, minimum number of examples, maximum clause length, minimum local improvement, minimum description length, allowed error, and variable depth. The paper presents the results of the system's application in some artificial and real-world domains, and special emphasis is given to the evaluation of obtained models by domain experts and their comments on the aspects of practical use of the induced knowledge."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
