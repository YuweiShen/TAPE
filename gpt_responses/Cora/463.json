This task is a classic example of a reinforcement learning problem, where an agent learns to navigate an environment by receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. \n\nNeural Networks are also present in the paper as the authors are designing computational architectures for the NRL Navigation task. Neural networks are a common tool used in machine learning to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs. \n\nTheory is present in the paper as the authors are developing a cognitive model of how humans acquire skills on complex cognitive tasks. This involves developing a theoretical understanding of the underlying cognitive processes involved in skill acquisition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
