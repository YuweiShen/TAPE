The joint probability distribution for the variables is assumed to belong to a set of distributions determined by a set of parametric models. The three approaches considered are based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) posterior probability, averaging over all the individual models in the model family, and using Rissanen's new definition of stochastic complexity. The experiments performed with the family of Naive Bayes models suggest that the stochastic complexity approach produces the most accurate predictions in the log-score sense. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Probabilistic Methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
