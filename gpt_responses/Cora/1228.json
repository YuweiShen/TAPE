The paper discusses the use of reinforcement learning techniques to enable teams of agents to learn effective policies with very few training examples even in the face of a large state space with large amounts of hidden state. The paper presents the algorithmic details of TPOT-RL as well as empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of the developed multi-agent learning approach with learned features."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
