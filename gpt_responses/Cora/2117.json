The authors analyze previous experiments that have been conducted on perceptual learning and suggest that the results may be influenced by the specific stimuli used in those experiments. They propose a new experimental design that takes into account the probabilistic nature of learning and stimulus specificity. Therefore, the paper is most related to probabilistic methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
