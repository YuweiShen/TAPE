The authors use a mixture model approach, which involves modeling the data as a mixture of underlying probability distributions, and then using statistical methods to estimate the parameters of these distributions. This approach is a common method for clustering data in a probabilistic way, and is discussed in detail throughout the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
