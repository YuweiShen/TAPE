The paper also discusses a priori probabilities of transitions being intact in the deterministic model. \n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper shows how an agent can act optimally in the bridge problem by reduction to Markov decision processes. The paper also suggests neuro-dynamic programming as a method of value function approximation for these types of models. \n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical examination of the bridge problem and its variants, discussing methods of solving them and noting their intractability for reasonably sized problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
