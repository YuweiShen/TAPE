The approach is based on a clausal representation of the learned formulae, which corresponds to a conjunctive normal form where each conjunct forms a constraint on positive examples. The paper also discusses the theoretical foundations of the approach and its relationship to classical attribute value learning, which falls under the category of Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
