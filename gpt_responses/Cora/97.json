The authors use a Bayesian framework to derive a joint posterior distribution of the parameters, which is then sampled using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The paper also discusses the use of ensemble methods to estimate the uncertainty in the model predictions. Therefore, the paper is primarily focused on probabilistic methods for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
