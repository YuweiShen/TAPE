The results obtained are promising: the evolved routines are able to correctly classify up to 93% of the images, which is better than the best algorithm we were able to write by hand. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Genetic Algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
