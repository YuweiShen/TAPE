The paper also considers the scaling of the proposal distribution in order to maximize the efficiency of the algorithm. The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimension of the target density converges to 1, which is a probabilistic concept. The paper does not discuss any other sub-categories of AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
