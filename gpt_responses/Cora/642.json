The formulation of the model construction problem is in the Bayesian framework for finite mixture models, and Bayesian inference is performed given such a model. The model construction problem can be seen as missing data estimation and a realization of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is described for finding good models. The comparison of results is based on the best results reported in the literature on the datasets in question. All of these aspects are related to probabilistic methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
