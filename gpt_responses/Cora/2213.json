The authors propose a two-level approach where an expert provides abstract meta-declarations and the user declares the relationship between the meta-level and the given database to obtain a low-level declarative language bias. This approach involves the use of schemata, which are abstract specifications of the declarative language bias. \n\nThe paper also discusses the properties of the translation algorithm that generates schemata, which falls under the sub-category of Theory in AI. The authors verify several properties of the translation algorithm and apply it successfully to a few chemical domains."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
