Chunking is a rule-based learning mechanism that uses explanations to generalize from specific examples. The paper also presents quantitative results on the utility of explanation-based learning, which is a theoretical approach to machine learning. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-categories of Rule Learning and Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
