The approach is based on reasoning evidentially from observations of the agent's actions to assess the plausibility of the various candidates. The authors demonstrate the approach on a problem in traffic monitoring, where the objective is to induce the plan of the driver from observation of vehicle movements."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
