The paper does not involve the application of any specific AI technique such as case-based reasoning, genetic algorithms, neural networks, probabilistic methods, reinforcement learning, or rule learning. Instead, it focuses on developing a theoretical framework to handle the problem of optimality and domination in such games."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
