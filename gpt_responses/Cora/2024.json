The focus is on the dynamics of the learning rule in terms of the eigenvectors of the matrix that is closely related to the covariance matrix of input cell activities. \n\nTheory: The paper presents some general theorems regarding the properties of the eigenvectors and their eigenvalues. It also provides analytic and numerical solutions for the eigenvectors at a specific layer of Linsker's network. The analysis of the circumstances in which each eigenvector dominates yields an explanation of the emergence of certain structures. The paper also develops criteria for estimating the boundary of the parameter regime in which certain structures emerge."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
