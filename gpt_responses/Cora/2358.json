This model is a type of neural network that can simulate the behavior of cortical neurons.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical explanation for the high interspike interval (ISI) variability displayed by visual cortical neurons. It examines the dynamics of neuronal integration and the variability in synaptic input current to understand this phenomenon. The paper also proposes a model that unifies seemingly contradictory arguments about neuronal spiking behavior."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
