The paper also mentions several standard methods for preserving neighbourhood relationships in these mappings, which include self-organizing maps (SOMs) and neural gas. \n- Theory: The paper focuses on the theoretical aspects of quantifying neighbourhood preservation in topographic mappings. It discusses how neighbourhoods are defined, how a perfectly neighbourhood preserving mapping is defined, and how an objective function for measuring discrepancies from perfect neighbourhood preservation is defined. The paper also introduces a particular measure for topographic distortion, which has the form of a quadratic assignment problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
