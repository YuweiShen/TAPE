The paper reviews the basic principles of PINs and shows how the well-known forward-backward (F-B) and Viterbi algorithms for HMMs are special cases of more general inference algorithms for arbitrary PINs. The paper also introduces examples of relatively complex models to handle sensor fusion and coarticulation in speech recognition, which are treated within the graphical model framework to illustrate the advantages of the general approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
