The paper also discusses the importance of probability distributions in describing the minimat world. \n\nTheory: The paper aims to establish initial answers to questions about how the structure of an environment affects the behaviors of organisms that have evolved in it. It presents a theoretical framework for studying the impact of global environment structure on individual behavior and discusses the complexity of this study due to the way minimats construct their own environments through their individual behaviors."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
