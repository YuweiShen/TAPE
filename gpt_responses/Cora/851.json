The paper demonstrates the capabilities of the theory in two typical types of machine learning: incremental concept learning and unsupervised data classification, both of which involve probabilistic reasoning. The title of the paper also explicitly mentions Bayesian probability theory, which is a probabilistic method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
