The paper compares the performance of this algorithm with selective and non-selective naive Bayesian classifiers, which are also probabilistic methods. The focus of the paper is on improving the accuracy and computational efficiency of Bayesian network classifiers, which are based on probabilistic reasoning. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Probabilistic Methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
