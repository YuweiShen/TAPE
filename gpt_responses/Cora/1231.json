The paper specifically focuses on extending STGP by allowing for type inheritance, which is a modification to the genetic operators used in the algorithm. While the paper does touch on some theoretical aspects of STGP and type inheritance, the primary focus is on the practical implementation and experimentation with the extended algorithm. Therefore, while there may be some overlap with other sub-categories of AI, Genetic Algorithms is the most closely related."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
