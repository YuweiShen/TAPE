The programs are evolved using fixed and randomly-generated fitness cases, which is a characteristic of genetic algorithms. The paper also discusses the implementation of the genetic programming system and the results of testing the evolved programs, further supporting the use of genetic algorithms in this research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
