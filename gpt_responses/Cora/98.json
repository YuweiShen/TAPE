The agent learns from its past experiences and adjusts its actions accordingly to maximize the reward. \n\nRule Learning is present in the paper as the authors use a finite automata learning algorithm to generate a model of the adversarial robot's behavior. The automaton is used to predict the next move of the adversary, and the robot agent plans a path to avoid it based on the learned rules."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
