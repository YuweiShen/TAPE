The paper also belongs to the sub-category of Rule Learning because it uses a diabolo classifier, which is a rule-based classifier. The diabolo classifier is designed to be invariant under transformations like rotation, scale or slope and can deal with variations in stroke order and writing direction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
