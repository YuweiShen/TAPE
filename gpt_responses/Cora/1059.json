The k-Median Algorithm is also mentioned, which is a probabilistic algorithm used for clustering.\n\nTheory: The paper proposes mathematical programming formulations for feature selection, clustering, and robust representation problems. These formulations are theoretically justifiable and computationally implementable in a finite number of steps. The paper also discusses the generalization of leaner models, which is a theoretical concept in machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
