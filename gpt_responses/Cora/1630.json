The paper also discusses the distribution of performance for neural networks in common problems.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper discusses the assumption of Gaussian distribution in data averaging and how it can significantly affect the interpretation of results, especially those of comparison studies. The paper proposes new guidelines for reporting performance which provide more information about the actual distribution (e.g. box-whiskers plots). The paper also emphasizes the importance of appropriate statistical tests and ensuring that any assumptions made in the tests are valid (e.g. normality of the distribution), which are key aspects of probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
