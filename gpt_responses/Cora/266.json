The co-evolutionary model of design also involves the evolution of a solution space in response to a problem space, which is a common feature of genetic algorithms. \n\nTheory is also present in the text as the paper discusses the concept of emergence and its mechanism, drawing on insights from the Artificial Life research community. The paper also proposes a hypothesis about identifying emergent behaviour using the co-evolutionary design approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
