The authors present an example of how an optimization problem can be derived from detailed non-linear neural dynamics, and how different weight dynamics can be derived from two types of objective function terms and two types of constraints. \n\nTheory: The paper presents a framework for constrained optimization for neural map formation, which includes an objective function and constraints from which weight growth and normalization rules can be derived. The authors investigate how different weight dynamics can be derived from the same optimization problem, and how coordinate transformations play a role in this process. The paper also discusses how the constrained optimization framework can help in understanding, generating, and comparing different models of neural map formation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
