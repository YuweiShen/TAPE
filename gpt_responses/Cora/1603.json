This approach is based on genetic algorithms, which are used to evolve the substructures.\n\nNeural Networks: The paper does not explicitly mention neural networks, but the cooperative coevolutionary approach involves the interaction of substructures to form higher level structures, which is similar to the way neural networks are constructed. Additionally, the architecture is designed to be general enough to incorporate a priori knowledge, which is a common feature of neural network models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
