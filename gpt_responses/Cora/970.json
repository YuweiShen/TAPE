GP uses variable size representations as programs and evolves them through genetic operations such as mutation and crossover. \n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper analyzes the size and generality issues in programs evolved to control an agent in a dynamic and non-deterministic environment, as exemplified by the Pac-Man game. This is a classic problem in Reinforcement Learning, where an agent learns to take actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
