The authors state that their model is based on the principles of Bayesian networks, which are a type of probabilistic graphical model.\n\nRule Learning: The paper also discusses the use of rules in commonsense reasoning and how their model can learn new rules incrementally. The authors state that their model can learn new rules by observing examples and generalizing from them, which is a form of rule learning. They also mention that their model can use existing rules to guide its reasoning and make predictions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
