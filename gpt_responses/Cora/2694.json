The bounds are based on probabilities over partitions of the union of in-sample and out-of-sample data into in-sample and out-of-sample data sets. The bounds apply when in-sample and out-of-sample data are drawn from the same distribution. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
