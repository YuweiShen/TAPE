The architecture used combines timedelay windows and recurrent connections to capture the important dynamic information of the speech signal. The paper explores schemes for sparse connection and connection pruning in fully connected recurrent networks. The networks are evaluated in a hybrid HMM/ANN system for phoneme recognition on the TIMIT database and for word recognition on the WAXHOLM database. Therefore, the paper is primarily focused on the use of neural networks for speech recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
