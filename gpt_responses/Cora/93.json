The authors propose a blocking Gibbs sampling algorithm to improve the efficiency of the analysis. The paper also discusses the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which are another type of probabilistic method commonly used in Bayesian inference."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
