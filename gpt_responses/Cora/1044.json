The paper introduces Location-Independent Transformations (LITs) as a strategy for implementing learning models with dynamic topologies efficiently in parallel hardware. The Location-Independent ASOCS (LIA) model is presented as a specific LIT for ASOCS Adaptive Algorithm 2. Therefore, the paper primarily belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
