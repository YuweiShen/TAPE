The paper also presents methods for estimating the best value of the regularisation parameter, which is a key aspect of probabilistic methods. While other sub-categories of AI may also be relevant to this paper, such as Neural Networks, the focus on regularisation and parameter estimation aligns most closely with Probabilistic Methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
