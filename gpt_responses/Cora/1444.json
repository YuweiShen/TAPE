The paper discusses how this class of rules can be learned using equivalence and membership queries, which are common techniques in rule learning. The results of the paper are also shown to be applicable to learning efficient goal-decomposition rules in planning domains, further emphasizing the focus on rule learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
