This involves random generation of queries to the program, which is a probabilistic approach. \n\nRule Learning: The paper discusses the use of integrity constraints as a replacement for negative examples in ILP. Integrity constraints are first-order clauses that can play the role of negative examples in an inductive process. The proposed algorithm allows the use of integrity constraints instead of (or together with) negative examples, which can lead to more accurate definitions. This is an example of rule learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
