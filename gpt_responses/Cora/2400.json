The paper describes a self-organizing model of orientation maps in the primary visual cortex, which is a type of neural network. The model is used to study the tilt aftereffect, a psychological phenomenon related to visual perception. The paper explains how the same self-organizing processes that are responsible for the long-term development of the map and its lateral connections also result in tilt aftereffects over short time scales in the adult. The model allows observing large numbers of neurons and connections simultaneously, making it possible to relate higher-level phenomena to low-level events, which is difficult to do experimentally. The results give computational support for the idea that direct tilt aftereffects arise from adaptive lateral interactions between feature detectors, as has long been surmised. The model thus provides a unified computational explanation of self-organization and both direct and indirect tilt aftereffects in the primary visual cortex."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
