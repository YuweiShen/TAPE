The language is object-centered, with nodes and connections of a graph representing the neural network. The algorithms are based on parallel local computations and communication along the connections. Therefore, the paper is primarily related to the sub-category of AI known as Neural Networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
