The architecture is designed to handle sensor noise, sensor failure, and uncertainty about the behavior of other vehicles and the effects of one's own actions. The approach has been implemented in a computer simulation system, and the autonomous vehicle successfully negotiates a variety of difficult situations. The use of probabilistic methods is central to the approach described in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
