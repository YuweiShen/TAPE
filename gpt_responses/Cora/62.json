The paper proposes a formal notion of context-specific independence (CSI) based on regularities in the conditional probability tables (CPTs) at a node, and suggests a qualitative representation scheme for capturing CSI. The paper also discusses ways in which this representation can be used to support effective inference algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
