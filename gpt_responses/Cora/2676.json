The authors also propose a biologically plausible extension of the model that takes into account the functional architecture of early vision.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding perceptual learning in vernier hyperacuity, specifically within the context of the HyperBF model. The authors explore various learning modes that can coexist within the framework and propose two unsupervised learning rules that may be involved in hyperacuity learning. They also report results of psychophysical experiments that support their hypothesis about activity-dependent presynaptic amplification in perceptual learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
