Gibbs sampling is a probabilistic method used for generating samples from a probability distribution, and the analysis of geometric ergodicity is a probabilistic concept related to the convergence of Markov chains. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Probabilistic Methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
