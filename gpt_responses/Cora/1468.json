It proposes a new algorithm based on leave-one-out cross-validation to address this issue. While the paper mentions the use of a randomized learning algorithm to generate the set of hypotheses, it does not focus on any specific sub-category of AI such as neural networks or genetic algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
