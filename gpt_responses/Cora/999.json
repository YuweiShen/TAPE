This involves probabilistic reasoning and statistical inference. \n\nTheory: The paper proposes a new method for model averaging and selection that is based on theoretical considerations about the information contained in training points that are left out of individual bootstrap samples. The paper also discusses the advantages of this method over Bayesian approaches, which involves theoretical arguments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
