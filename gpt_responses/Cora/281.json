The coordination modules in Clay use reinforcement learning to activate specific assemblages based on the presently perceived situation, and learning occurs as the robot selects assemblages and samples a reinforcement signal over time. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Reinforcement Learning in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
