The approach is based on the use of orthogonal basis functions to describe the output weights and treating the hidden nodes as the orthogonal representation of the network in the output weights domain. The paper also discusses a special relationship orthogonal backpropagation (OBP) rule for training the hidden nodes. All of these concepts are related to neural networks, making it the most relevant sub-category of AI for this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
