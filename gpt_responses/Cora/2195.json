The declarative representation allows for incremental knowledge modification, which is a key feature of probabilistic methods.\n\nRule Learning: The paper proposes an approach that combines the advantages of declarative and procedural representations of knowledge. This approach involves learning knowledge in a declarative form and then transferring it to a procedural form tailored to the specific decision making situation. This can be seen as a form of rule learning, where decision structures are determined based on the available attributes and their relevance to the decision making situation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
