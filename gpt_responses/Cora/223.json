The approach presented in the paper uses empirical evaluation to guide the search for optimal parameter values.\n- Rule Learning: The paper specifically mentions the use of an inductive concept learning system called Magnus, which is a rule learning algorithm. The approach presented in the paper uses local optimization to select the best model, which is a common technique in rule learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
