Incy, the inductive learner described in the paper, uses rule models for control decisions in the data-driven phase and for model-guided induction. \n\nProbabilistic Methods are also present in the text as the paper discusses how the hypothesis space searched is restricted in some way, either through data-driven or model-based approaches. These approaches can be seen as implicitly or explicitly incorporating probabilistic reasoning into the learning process."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
