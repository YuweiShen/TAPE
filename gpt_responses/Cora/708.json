The EM algorithm with a generalized iterative scaling procedure is used for parameter estimation. The paper also discusses relations with certain classes of stochastic feedforward neural networks, but this is not the main focus of the paper. The other sub-categories of AI (Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Rule Learning, Theory) are not directly relevant to the content of the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
