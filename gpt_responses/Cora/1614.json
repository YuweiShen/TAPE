The authors use a novel class of priors on parameters of latent components to provide smoothness priors on autoregressive coefficients, which allows for formal inference on model order and incorporation of uncertainty about model order into summary inferences. The paper also discusses the use of Bayesian inference in analyzing the frequency composition of time series and in overcoming problems in spectral estimation with autoregressive models using more traditional model fitting methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
