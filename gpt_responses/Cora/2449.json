The learning algorithm exploits the information contained in the sketch to refine the rules learned by the ILP system. \n- Theory: The paper proposes a mechanism for improving the performance of ILP systems and describes the details of the learning algorithm that exploits the information contained in the sketch. The experiments carried out with the implemented system demonstrate the usefulness of the method and its potential in future applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
