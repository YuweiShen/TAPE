These strategies are constructed from a knowledge base of generic problem management strategies, which can be seen as a set of rules for handling different types of problems that may arise during program execution.\n\nCase Based: The paper discusses the domain of conceptual design of jet engine nozzles, and how the proposed approach is effective in improving analysis program robustness and design optimization performance in this domain. This can be seen as a case-based approach, where knowledge and experience from previous cases (i.e. previous designs of jet engine nozzles) are used to inform the design of new cases."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
