It also mentions the sum of squared errors as a function of weights, which is a common concept in neural network training. \n\nTheory: The paper explores the concept of local minima in neural network training and provides an example of a network with a local minimum that is not a global minimum. It also mentions the possibility of smaller binary examples existing, indicating a theoretical exploration of the topic."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
