Specifically, the authors use genetic algorithms to evolve neural network architectures and reinforcement learning to optimize the performance of these networks. The coevolutionary approach allows for the simultaneous evolution of both the network architecture and the task-specific weights, resulting in more efficient and effective learning. Rule learning and probabilistic methods are not explicitly mentioned in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
