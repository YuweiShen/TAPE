Boosting is a probabilistic method that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. \n\nRule Learning: Both algorithms construct a complementary level-0 classifier that can only generate coarse hypotheses for the training data. This is a form of rule learning, where the level-0 classifier generates rules or hypotheses for the data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
