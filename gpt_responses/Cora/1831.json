The paper then proposes three subset selection methods to reduce the number of function-tree evaluations needed during the GP algorithm. The paper primarily focuses on the use of genetic programming and its optimization techniques, making it most closely related to the Genetic Algorithms sub-category of AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
