It explains how neural networks can be trained to learn from data and make predictions.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper also discusses the use of reinforcement learning for robot navigation. It explains how the robot can learn to navigate its environment by receiving rewards for successful actions and punishments for unsuccessful actions.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper discusses the use of probabilistic methods for protein folding. It explains how probabilistic models can be used to predict the most likely structure of a protein based on its amino acid sequence."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
