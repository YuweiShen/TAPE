The network extends the Kohonen Feature Map architecture with activation retention and decay to create unique distributed response patterns for different sequences. The network has been successful in mapping arbitrary sequences of binary and real numbers, as well as phonemic representations of English words. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI called Neural Networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
