The paper adapts a framework developed for supervised learning and gives simple derivations for many of the standard iterative algorithms like gradient projection and EM. The paper also discusses the use of relative entropy and second-order Taylor expansion in the context of this problem. All of these concepts are related to probabilistic methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
