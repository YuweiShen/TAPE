It discusses the adaptation of weights in the network using a local delta rule. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The algorithm is derived from a mean field approximation for large, layered sigmoid belief networks. The paper shows how to infer the statistics of these networks without resort to sampling by solving the mean field equations, which relate the statistics of each unit to those of its Markov blanket. The statistics of the network are used as target values for weight adaptation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
