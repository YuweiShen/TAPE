The process involves creating a population of candidate programs, selecting the fittest individuals, and breeding them to create the next generation. This is a classic example of genetic algorithms.\n\nRule Learning: The evolved programs are represented using cellular encoding, which is a form of rule-based representation. The paper discusses how the evolved programs can be interpreted as sets of rules that govern the behavior of the automata. This is an example of rule learning, where the system learns a set of rules that govern its behavior."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
