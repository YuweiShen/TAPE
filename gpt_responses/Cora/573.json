The model uses probability theory to determine acceptance conditions for arbitrary right-nested conditionals. The paper also discusses the use of minimal conditional revision, which ensures that an agent makes as few changes as possible to the conditional component of its belief set. Overall, the paper is focused on probabilistic methods for belief revision."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
