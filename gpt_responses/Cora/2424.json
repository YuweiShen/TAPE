The paper also discusses the use of saturant generalization, which is a rule learning technique proposed by Rouveirol. The focus of the paper is on deriving hypotheses from examples and background theories using rule-based methods, which falls under the sub-category of AI known as rule learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
