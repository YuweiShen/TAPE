The authors also mention that they have reimplemented Assistant, a system for top down induction of decision trees, using RELIEFF as an estimator of attributes at each selection step. \n\nProbabilistic Methods are present in the text as the paper discusses the limitations of current inductive machine learning algorithms that use myopic impurity functions and limited look-ahead, which prevent them from detecting significant conditional dependencies between the attributes that describe training objects. The proposed approach using RELIEFF aims to overcome this myopia and improve the accuracy of inductive learning algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
