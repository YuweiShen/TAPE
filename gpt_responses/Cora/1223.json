The paper does not use any specific AI sub-category such as neural networks, probabilistic methods, or reinforcement learning. Instead, it focuses on developing a theoretical framework for model selection that can be applied to most function learning tasks. Therefore, the paper belongs to the Theory sub-category of AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
