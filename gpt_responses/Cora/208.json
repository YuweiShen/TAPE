The evaluation function used in the search is a random variable, which requires trading off accuracy of estimates for increased state exploration. The paper also discusses how recent feature subset selection algorithms in the machine learning literature fit into this search problem as simple hill climbing approaches."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
