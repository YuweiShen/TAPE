This technique is a probabilistic method as it involves modeling the probability distribution of the sequences.\n\nRule Learning: The paper discusses predicate invention, which is a subfield of rule learning. The approach presented, MERLIN 2.0, is a system for guiding predicate invention by sequences of input clauses in SLD-refutations of positive and negative examples w.r.t. an overly general theory. The paper also compares MERLIN 2.0 with the positive only learning framework of Progol 4.2, which is another system for rule learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
