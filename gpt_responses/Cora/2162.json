The approach involves freezing crucial nodes (features) in the hidden layers of a neural network after learning a category, and then using these frozen features in subsequent learning to recognize other categories. The paper does not mention any other sub-categories of AI such as Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Probabilistic Methods, Reinforcement Learning, Rule Learning, or Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
