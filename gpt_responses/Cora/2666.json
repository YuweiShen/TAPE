This approach proves superior to routing based on precomputed shortest paths.\n- Probabilistic Methods: The nodes in the network use local information to keep accurate statistics on which routing policies lead to minimal routing times. This involves probabilistic methods to estimate the expected rewards of different actions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
