The paper also compares the performance of SVM with other approximation techniques, including polynomial and rational approximation, local polynomial techniques, Radial Basis Functions, and Neural Networks. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Neural Networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
