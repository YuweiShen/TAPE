The paper also utilizes probabilistic methods, such as the stochastic-approximation theorem, to prove convergence of the algorithms. Finally, the paper falls under the category of theory as it develops generalizations of value iteration, policy iteration, model-based reinforcement-learning, and Q-learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
