The paper explores different strategies for parallelizing the training process of SRNNs, which are a type of neural network that can process sequential data. \n\nAdditionally, the paper also touches upon the sub-category of Reinforcement Learning as it discusses the use of a reinforcement learning algorithm called Q-learning to optimize the training process of SRNNs. The authors propose a Q-learning-based approach to dynamically adjust the learning rate of the SRNNs during training, which can improve their convergence speed and accuracy."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
