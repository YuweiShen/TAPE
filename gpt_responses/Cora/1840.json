The ARL algorithm uses genetic operations to discover and modify subroutines, which act as building blocks to accelerate the evolution of good representations for learning from observation and interaction with an environment. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Genetic Algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
