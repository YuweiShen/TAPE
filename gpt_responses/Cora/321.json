The paper extends prior work on temporally abstract models and presents new results in the theory of planning with macro actions. \n\nTheory is also relevant as the paper presents a formal semantics of models of macro actions that guarantees the validity of planning using such models. The paper also discusses the generalization of the classical notion of a macro operator and the need for macro actions to represent common-sense higher-level actions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
