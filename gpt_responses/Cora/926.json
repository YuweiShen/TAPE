This concept is related to case-based reasoning, which involves solving new problems by adapting solutions from similar past cases. \n- Rule Learning: The paper specifically mentions the 1R algorithm and C4.5, which are both rule learning algorithms. The paper also proposes using the 1-NN algorithm to derive a normalizing baseline for generalization statistics, which can be seen as a rule-based approach to normalization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
