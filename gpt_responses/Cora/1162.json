This paper belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI. The paper uses Bayesian framework and reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to address the problem of model order uncertainty in autoregressive (AR) time series. The full conditional density for the AR parameters is obtained analytically, and efficient model jumping is achieved by proposing model space moves from it. The paper also compares this method with an alternative method, which proposes moves only for the new parameters in each move."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
