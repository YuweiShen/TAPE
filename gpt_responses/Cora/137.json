The paper also introduces and compares different auxiliary variable methods for MCMC, which are all probabilistic in nature. The applications discussed in the paper, such as binary classification and PET reconstruction, also involve probabilistic modeling and inference."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
