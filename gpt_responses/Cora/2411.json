The paper discusses the limitations of Q-routing and proposes a solution that keeps the best experiences learned and reuses them by predicting the traffic trend. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified through simulations. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Reinforcement Learning in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
