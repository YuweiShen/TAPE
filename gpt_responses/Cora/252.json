They use the Compositional Q-Learning (CQ-L) architecture to acquire skills for performing composite tasks with a simulated two-linked manipulator. They also mention the use of Q-Learning in planning tasks, using a classifier system to encode the necessary condition-action rules.\n\nRule learning is also mentioned in the context of incorporating domain knowledge into reinforcement learning agents. The authors discuss the use of a classifier system to encode condition-action rules and the incorporation of domain knowledge to restrict the size of the state-action space, leading to faster learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
