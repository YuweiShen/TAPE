This function is used to train neural network classifiers.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper mentions Bayesian discrimination, which is a probabilistic method for classification. Differential learning is said to require the least classifier complexity necessary for Bayesian discrimination.\n\nTheory: The paper proves that differential learning is asymptotically efficient and guarantees the best generalization allowed by the choice of hypothesis class as the training sample size grows large. It also states that differential learning almost always guarantees the best generalization allowed by the choice of hypothesis class for small training sample sizes. These are theoretical results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
