This paper belongs to the sub-category of Rule Learning. The text discusses the use of decision lists, which are ordered lists of conjunctive rules, and how inductive algorithms such as AQ and CN2 learn decision lists incrementally, one rule at a time. The paper also addresses the rule overlap problem and proposes a novel solution to the problem by composing decision lists from homogeneous rules. The focus of the paper is on learning rules and decision lists, which falls under the sub-category of Rule Learning in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
