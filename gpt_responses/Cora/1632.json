They compare two reinforcement learning algorithms: TD-Q learning with linear neural networks and Probabilistic Incremental Program Evolution (PIPE). \n\nProbabilistic Methods are also used in the PIPE algorithm, which uses adaptive \"probabilistic prototype trees\" to synthesize programs that calculate action probabilities from current inputs. \n\nNeural Networks are used in the TD-Q algorithm, which uses linear neural networks as evaluation functions (EFs) to map input/action pairs to expected reward."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
