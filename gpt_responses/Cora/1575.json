The authors show that for large and difficult MAX-SAT instances, the contribution of cross-over to the search process is marginal. Little is lost if it is dispensed altogether, running mutation and selection as an enlarged Metropolis process. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper compares genetic algorithms to the Metropolis process and simulated annealing, which are both probabilistic methods. The authors show that for these problem instances, genetic search consistently performs worse than simulated annealing when subject to similar resource bounds. The correspondence between the two algorithms is made more precise via a decomposition argument, and provides a framework for interpreting the results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
