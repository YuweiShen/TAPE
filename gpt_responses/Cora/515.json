The paper also proposes a QR matrix representation for the sensitivities and/or conditional probabilities, which is more efficient for computer-based implementations of probabilistic inference. The paper also describes an exact algorithm for probabilistic inference that uses the QR-representation for sensitivities and updates probability distributions of nodes in a network according to messages from the neighbors."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
