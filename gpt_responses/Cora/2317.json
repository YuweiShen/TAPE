This is a form of genetic algorithm that evolves the architecture of the neural network.\n\nNeural Networks: The paper focuses on training neural networks for balancing poles attached to a cart on a fixed track. The learning times and generalization capabilities of the neural networks are compared for different methods, including the use of cellular encoding. The paper also discusses the architectures produced by cellular encoding, which are neural networks with specific structures and weights."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
