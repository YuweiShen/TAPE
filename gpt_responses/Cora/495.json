The paper also proposes an alternative semantical view of update that incorporates observations into a belief set by explaining them in terms of a set of plausible events and predicting further consequences of those explanations.\n\nTheory: The paper presents an alternative semantical view of belief update and argues that certain assumptions underlying the KM postulates are not always reasonable and restrict our ability to integrate update with other forms of revision when reasoning about action. The paper also discusses the semantics of update and how it relies on information that is not readily available."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
