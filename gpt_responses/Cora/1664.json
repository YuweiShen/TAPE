The paper proposes a new approach to address this problem by using probabilistic methods to estimate the value of different actions. The authors argue that this approach can lead to more efficient exploration and better decision-making in RL tasks. Therefore, the paper also belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
