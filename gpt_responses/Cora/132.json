The system uses a reward function to guide the robot's actions and learn from its experiences.\n\nProbabilistic Methods are also present in the paper as the authors use Bayesian inference to model the uncertainty in the robot's environment and update the robot's beliefs about the world based on new sensor data. The authors also use probabilistic models to predict the outcomes of the robot's actions and choose the best course of action based on these predictions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
