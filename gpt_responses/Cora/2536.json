This paper belongs to the sub-category of Reinforcement Learning as it discusses the efficient implementation of TD() for use with reinforcement learning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. It proposes the TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences) procedure as an alternative to the traditional approach based on eligibility traces. The paper also mentions well-known reinforcement learning algorithms such as AHC or Q-learning, which can be viewed as instances of TD learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
