The system is designed to provide more flexible performance in novel environments by using past experiences (cases) to inform its behavior. \n- Reinforcement Learning: The paper discusses how the new system, ACBARR, overcomes a standard \"hard\" problem for reactive systems, the box canyon, by using reinforcement learning. The system learns from its experiences and adjusts its behavior accordingly to avoid getting stuck in a dead-end situation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
