The model is based on the interactions between excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the ganglion cells.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper uses probabilistic methods to simulate the behavior of the ganglion cells. The authors use a stochastic model to simulate the firing of the cells, which takes into account the variability in the inputs to the cells and the intrinsic noise in the cells themselves. The authors also use statistical methods to analyze the results of their simulations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
