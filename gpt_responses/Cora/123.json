The method is evaluated by computer experiments and produces remarkable speedup compared to other methods of integrating these systems. The paper does not involve any application of AI sub-categories such as Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Probabilistic Methods, Reinforcement Learning, or Rule Learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
