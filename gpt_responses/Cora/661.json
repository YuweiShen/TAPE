The resulting model yields a likelihood measure of goodness of fit, allowing ML and MAP estimation techniques to be utilized. The paper also discusses a hidden Markov version of the tree for data sequences that have temporal dependencies. These are all characteristics of probabilistic methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
