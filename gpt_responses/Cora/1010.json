This is a form of rule learning, where the goal is to learn logical rules that capture relationships between variables in the data. \n- Theory: The paper presents a new approach to ILP that introduces a declarative bias to keep the growth of the training set within linear bounds. This bias is a theoretical constraint on the search space of the ILP algorithm. The paper also discusses the advantages and deficiencies of the proposed approach, which is a theoretical analysis of the method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
