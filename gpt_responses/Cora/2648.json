Virtual examples generated by domain knowledge are rehearsed in parallel with each new task using either the standard multiple task learning (MTL) or the MTL neural network methods. This approach is similar to case-based reasoning, where past cases are used to solve new problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
