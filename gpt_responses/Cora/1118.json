The algorithm is developed for a simple, linear learning system - the LMS or delta rule with a separate learning-rate parameter for each input. The algorithm adjusts the learning-rate parameters, which are an important form of bias for this system.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The appropriate bias is viewed as the key to efficient learning and generalization. The IDBD algorithm adapts bias based on previous learning experience, making it suitable for drifting or non-stationary learning tasks. The paper shows that the IDBD algorithm performs better than ordinary LMS and finds the optimal learning rates for particular tasks of this type. The IDBD algorithm is also presented as an incremental form of hold-one-out cross-validation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
