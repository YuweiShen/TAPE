The RISE system searches for rules in a specific-to-general fashion, starting with one rule per training example. \n\nCase Based is also present in the text as the RISE system uses a best-match strategy for classification, which reduces to nearest-neighbor if all generalizations of instances were rejected. This is a characteristic of case-based reasoning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
