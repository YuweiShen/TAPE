This paper belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks as it discusses the possibilities of incorporating control mechanisms into connectionist networks (CN) built from large numbers of relatively simple neuron-like units. The paper explores the different kinds of control mechanisms found in various systems such as the brain, fetal development, cellular function, immune system, and social organizations that might be useful in CN. The paper also examines the absence of powerful control structures and processes in CN and suggests mechanisms for central control that CN already have built into them."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
