The paper specifically focuses on the methods of temporal differences, which have been used in reinforcement learning algorithms such as Samuel's checker player, Holland's bucket brigade, and the author's Adaptive Heuristic Critic. The paper proves the convergence and optimality of these methods for special cases and relates them to supervised-learning methods. The paper argues that most problems to which supervised learning is currently applied are really prediction problems of the sort to which temporal-difference methods can be applied to advantage. Overall, the paper is primarily focused on reinforcement learning methods for prediction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
