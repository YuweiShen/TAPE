The case-base stores the paths and the information about their traversability, and while planning the route, those paths are preferred that according to the former experience are least risky. This is a clear example of case-based reasoning.\n- Probabilistic Methods: Although not explicitly mentioned, the approach presented in the paper involves using information about the traversability of paths to make probabilistic decisions about which paths to take. The paths that are least risky according to former experience are preferred, which implies that some sort of probabilistic reasoning is being used to evaluate the risk associated with each path."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
