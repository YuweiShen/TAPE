This paper belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks as it investigates the ability of a novel artificial neural network, bp-som, to avoid overfitting. The paper combines a multi-layered feed-forward network with Kohonen's self-organising maps during training to find adequate hidden-layer representations. The paper shows that bp-som outperforms standard backpropagation and back-propagation with a weight decay when dealing with the problem of overfitting."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
