The authors also mention the use of Bayesian methods for model selection and regularization.\n\nTheory: The paper presents theoretical results on the convergence of the optimal finite-dimensional linear model to the true underlying function as the number of basis functions increases. The authors also discuss the trade-off between model complexity and generalization performance, which is a fundamental concept in machine learning theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
