This criterion can be applied to general prediction problems and rules, including regression and classification. The use of covariance suggests a probabilistic approach to model selection.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a new criterion for model selection and relates it to other model selection procedures. It also provides a measure of the effective number of parameters used by an adaptive procedure. These aspects suggest a theoretical approach to model selection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
