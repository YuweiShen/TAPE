This is a key concept in neural network models of learning and memory.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding how afferent excitatory and lateral inhibitory synaptic plasticity contribute to ocular dominance. It proposes a mathematical model that can be used to simulate the effects of these processes on neural activity in the visual cortex."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
