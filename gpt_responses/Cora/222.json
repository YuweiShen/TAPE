The ML-Modeler component also generates plausible hypotheses about the student's misconceptions and errors, which involves probabilistic reasoning. While other sub-categories of AI may also be relevant to the project, such as case-based reasoning and neural networks, the use of probabilistic methods is the most prominent and relevant to the text."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
