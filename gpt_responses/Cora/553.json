This paper belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks. The paper proposes a new architecture that maintains spatial relations between input features using LEGION dynamics and slow inhibition. The network selects the largest object in an input scene with many objects and can be adjusted to select several largest objects. The paper also shows that a two-stage selection network gains efficiency by combining selection with parallel removal of noisy regions. The network is applied to select the most salient object in real images. The paper discusses the classical topic of winner-take-all (WTA) networks, which are widely used in unsupervised learning, cortical processing, and attentional control. However, WTA networks do not encode spatial relations in the input, and thus cannot support sensory and perceptual processing where spatial relations are important. The paper proposes a new architecture that overcomes this limitation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
