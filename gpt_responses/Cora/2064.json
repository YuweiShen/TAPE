The method involves using a market-based approach where participants bet on securities contingent on the uncertain events, and the consensus probability of each event is defined as the corresponding security's equilibrium price. The paper also discusses how the market framework provides explicit monetary incentives for participation and honesty, and how \"no arbitrage\" arguments ensure that the equilibrium prices form legal probabilities. Overall, the paper is focused on probabilistic methods for pooling opinions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
