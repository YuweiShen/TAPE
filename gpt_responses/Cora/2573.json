The authors propose an optimum decision rule based on the posterior probabilities of the classes given the input pattern. They also discuss the use of prior probabilities and the likelihood function in computing the posterior probabilities.\n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Rule Learning because it proposes a decision rule that is based on a set of rules. The authors use a set of decision rules to classify the input pattern into one of the classes. They also discuss the use of decision trees and rule induction algorithms in generating decision rules."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
