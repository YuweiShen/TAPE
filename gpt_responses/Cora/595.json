This paper describes an alternative class of gradient-based systems consisting of two feedforward nets that learn to deal with temporal sequences using fast weights. The method offers the potential for STM storage efficiency. Various learning methods are derived. Two experiments with unknown time delays illustrate the approach. The paper focuses on the use of neural networks for supervised sequence learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
