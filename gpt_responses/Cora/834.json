It discusses the use of a two-unit system and a system of several neurons with linear negative feedback to estimate independent components.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper discusses the estimation of independent components from sphered data and non-sphered (raw) mixtures. It also mentions the estimation of independent components with positive and negative kurtosis, which is a probabilistic measure of the shape of a distribution. The convergence of the learning rules is proven without any unnecessary hypotheses on the distributions of the independent components."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
