The temporal difference algorithm TD() is applied to train a neural network to learn a heuristic evaluation function over states, which is then used by a one-step look-ahead search procedure to find good solutions to new scheduling problems. The results suggest that reinforcement learning can provide a new method for constructing high-performance scheduling systems. There is no mention of any other sub-category of AI in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
