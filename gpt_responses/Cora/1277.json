The user drives GP by deciding which individual should be the winner in tournament selection, allowing for running GP without a fitness function and transforming it into an efficient search procedure. The paper also proposes a strategy to further reduce user interaction by recording the choices made by the user in interactive runs and using them to build a model which can replace the user in longer runs. These are all characteristics of Genetic Algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
