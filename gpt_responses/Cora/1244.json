This involves the creation of rules to handle the continuous attributes. \n\nProbabilistic Methods are present in the text as the MDL pruning mechanism developed in the paper involves calculating the probability of a model given the data and the model complexity. This probability is used to determine which models to prune, with the goal of producing more comprehensible models while retaining their performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
