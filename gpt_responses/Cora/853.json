Algorithms that use ECOCs learn the function corresponding to each bit, and combine them to generate class predictions. \n\nTheory is also present in the text as the paper discusses the theoretical benefits of using ECOCs for multiclass classification tasks, specifically in reducing both variance and bias errors when the errors made at the output bits are not correlated. The paper also presents a theoretical approach to decorrelating the output bit predictions of local learners through feature selection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
