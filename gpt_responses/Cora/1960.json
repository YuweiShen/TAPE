The paper proposes a modification of the classical proximal point algorithm for finding zeroes of a maximal monotone operator in a Hilbert space. The authors establish weak global convergence and local linear rate of convergence under suitable assumptions. The analysis presented in the paper yields an alternative proof of convergence for the exact proximal point method, which allows a nice geometric interpretation and is somewhat more intuitive than the classical proof. There is no mention or application of any of the other sub-categories of AI listed."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
