The nodes adapt to the problem being learned and learn important features in the input space. The learning is done without requiring user adjustment of sensitive parameters and noise is tolerated with graceful degradation in performance. These are all characteristics of neural networks, which are a sub-category of AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
