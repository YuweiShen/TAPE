It then introduces Neural Programming, a connectionist representation for evolving programs that maintains the benefits of GP. \n\nNeural Networks: The paper discusses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and their popularity in the machine learning community due to the gradient-descent backpropagation procedure. It then introduces Neural Programming, which is a connectionist representation for evolving programs. \n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper introduces an Internal Reinforcement procedure for Neural Programming, which is a feedback mechanism for the evolutionary learning system. The paper demonstrates the use of Internal Reinforcement through an illustrative experiment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
