They also mention using a fitness function to find good solutions to large problem instances. \n\nProbabilistic Methods are present in the paper as the authors use a hybrid approach that incorporates heuristics based on knowledge about air traffic control. This suggests a probabilistic approach to finding solutions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
