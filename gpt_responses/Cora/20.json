The paper also describes a learning environment based on a natural combination of two noise models, and proposes a technique for learning in this environment based on statistical query learning. The paper shows that the noise tolerance of this technique is roughly optimal with respect to the desired learning accuracy and provides a smooth tradeoff between the tolerable amounts of the two types of noise. Therefore, the paper is primarily related to probabilistic methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
