The authors also suggest that the problem is difficult for Genetic Algorithms due to \"multiple levels of deception\".\n- Reinforcement Learning: The paper discusses redefining the problem so that the ant is \"obliged to traverse the trail in approximately the correct order\", which suggests a reinforcement learning approach where the ant is rewarded for following the correct order. However, the paper does not explicitly mention reinforcement learning as a technique used."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
