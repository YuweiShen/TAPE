The networks can have one or more layers of hidden units, with tree-like connectivity. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper discusses the implementation of the supervised learning algorithm for these Boltzmann machines exactly, without resort to simulated or mean-field annealing. The stochastic averages that yield the gradients in weight space are computed by the technique of decimation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
