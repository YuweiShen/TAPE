The paper also proposes a novel mutation operator for genetic programming. \n\nIt also belongs to the sub-category of Theory because it presents a theoretical analysis of the causes of bloat in search techniques with discrete variable length representations using simple static evaluation functions. The paper concludes that there are two causes of bloat: search operators with no length bias tend to sample bigger trees, and competition within populations favors longer programs as they can usually reproduce more accurately."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
