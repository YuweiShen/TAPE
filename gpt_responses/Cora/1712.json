The algorithm maintains correctly the mixture weights for edge-based prunings with any bounded loss function, and a similar algorithm is given for the logarithmic loss function with a corresponding weight allocation algorithm. These techniques are all related to probabilistic methods in AI, which deal with uncertainty and probability distributions over possible outcomes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
