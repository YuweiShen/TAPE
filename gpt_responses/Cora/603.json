This involves the accumulation of huge volumes of design information, which can be seen as a form of case-based reasoning. \n- Rule Learning: The paper proposes a method-specific data-to-knowledge compilation approach for integrating the legacy database with the knowledge system. This involves converting data accessed from the database into a form appropriate to the problem-solving method used in the knowledge system, which can be seen as a form of rule learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
