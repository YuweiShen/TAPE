It also mentions the similarity of the resulting filters with the receptive fields of simple cells in visual cortex, which suggests that these neurons form an information-theoretic co-ordinate system for images.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper discusses the use of Independent Components Analysis (ICA) to compare the resulting filters and their associated basis functions with other decorrelating filters produced by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and zero-phase whitening filters (ZCA). It also mentions that the outputs of these filters are as independent as possible, since the info-max network is able to perform ICA.\n\nTheory: The paper discusses the theoretical concepts of sparse, distributed representation of natural scenes, unsupervised learning algorithm that attempts to find a factorial code of independent visual features, and the emergence of responses from such algorithms. It also mentions the reasoning of Barlow (1989) that such responses should emerge from an unsupervised learning algorithm that attempts to find a factorial code of independent visual features."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
