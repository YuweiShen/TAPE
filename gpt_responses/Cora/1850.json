The paper introduces mechanisms like transcription, editing, and repairing into Genetic Programming to evolve computer programs. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by using it to develop programs for the prediction of sequences of integer numbers. Therefore, the paper is primarily related to Genetic Algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
