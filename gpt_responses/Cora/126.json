The Coupling from the Past (CFTP) algorithm and Fill's rejection sampling algorithm are both probabilistic methods used for perfect sampling of these models. The paper also mentions the use of Gibbs sampling, which is a probabilistic method commonly used in Bayesian inference."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
