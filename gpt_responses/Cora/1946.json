The paper also proposes a run-time heuristic to determine when to give up searching a plateau and restart, which is based on empirical observations of the search space and the behavior of the search algorithm.\n\nTheory: The paper investigates the properties of the search space and the behavior of hill-climbing search for solving hard, random Boolean satisfiability problems. The paper also determines the optimum point to terminate search and restart empirically over a range of problem sizes and complexities, and proposes a simple run-time heuristic based on these empirical results. The paper does not involve the implementation or application of AI techniques, but rather focuses on the theoretical analysis of a specific search algorithm for a specific problem domain."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
