The algorithms tested in the experiments are variants of probabilistic inference algorithms, such as Incremental Probabilistic Inference and the algorithm suggested by Goldszmidt. The paper also discusses the performance of these algorithms in a test domain, which is a common approach in probabilistic methods research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
