The authors describe the framework for their tree construction algorithm and how such trees can be transformed into an isomorphic neural network topology. They also examine several methods for learning the linear discriminant functions at each node of the tree structure and show that it is possible to simultaneously learn both the topology and weight settings of a neural network simply using the training data set that they are given.\n\nRule Learning: The paper discusses the construction of decision trees using threshold logic units (TLUs) and compares the accuracy of this method to classical information theoretic methods for constructing decision trees (which use single feature tests at each node). The authors show that their TLU trees are smaller and thus easier to understand than classical decision trees. They also discuss methods for learning the linear discriminant functions at each node of the tree structure, which can be seen as learning rules for making decisions based on the input features."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
