The system uses background musical knowledge to apply these transformations to the new phrase. \n\nIt also belongs to the sub-category of Rule Learning because the system uses rules based on the extracted expressive parameters to infer the possible transformations for the new phrase. These rules are learned from the set of cases and are used to guide the transformation process."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
