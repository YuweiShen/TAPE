The authors also develop a modification to this methodology involving the use of the stochastic gradient method in fitting polyclass models to given sets of basis functions. The focus of the paper is on developing a methodology for modeling conditional class probabilities, which is a probabilistic approach. There is no mention of case-based reasoning, genetic algorithms, reinforcement learning, rule learning, or theory in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
