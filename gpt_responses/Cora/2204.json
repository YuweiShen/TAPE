They state that \"the evolutionary approach is based on the principles of natural selection and genetic inheritance\" and describe how they use a genetic algorithm to evolve the robot's behavior.\n\nReinforcement Learning is also present in the paper as the authors use a reward-based system to train the robots. They state that \"the robots are trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm\" and describe how the robots receive rewards for completing tasks correctly."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
