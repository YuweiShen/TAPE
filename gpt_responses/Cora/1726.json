This is a type of rule learning where decision trees are generated to predict survival time based on the attributes of the patients. \n\nProbabilistic Methods are also present in the text as the study aimed to assess the relative importance of the factors that might predict survival of patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. This involves calculating probabilities of survival based on the different attributes of the patients."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
