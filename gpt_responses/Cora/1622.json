The algorithm conducts a top-down search for first-order clauses, which is a common approach in rule learning. \n\nProbabilistic Methods are present in the text as the algorithm described in the paper is stochastic, meaning it involves randomness and probability. The paper also mentions that preliminary experiments are favorable, which suggests that the algorithm's performance is evaluated using probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
