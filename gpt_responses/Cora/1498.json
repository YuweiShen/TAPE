The paper introduces the Inferential Theory of Learning, which provides a conceptual framework for explaining the logical capabilities of learning strategies. The theory postulates that learning is a process of modifying the learner's knowledge by exploring their experience, and that this process can be described as a search in a knowledge space guided by learning goals and using knowledge transmutations. The paper also outlines a multistrategy task-adaptive learning methodology that aims to integrate a range of inferential learning strategies.
