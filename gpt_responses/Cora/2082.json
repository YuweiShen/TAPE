The algorithm uses a set of rules to adapt the annealing schedule based on the performance of the current solution. This can be seen as a form of rule learning, where the algorithm learns from its own experience to improve its performance. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-categories of Probabilistic Methods and Rule Learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
