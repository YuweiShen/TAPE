The system is trained using a dataset of sound sources and their corresponding locations, and the neural network is used to predict the location of a sound source based on the input received from the robot's microphones.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper also discusses the use of probabilistic methods for sound localization, specifically the use of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to model the distribution of sound sources in the environment. The GMM is used to estimate the probability of a sound source being located at a particular position, given the input received from the robot's microphones."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
