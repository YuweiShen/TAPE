The study also examines the effects of non-coding segments on both of these representations, which are a computational model of non-coding DNA and mimic the location independence of genes. The paper concludes that the combination of non-coding segments and floating building blocks encourages a GA to take advantage of its parallel search and recombination abilities. Therefore, the paper is primarily related to Genetic Algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
