The experiments confirm the advantages of such structures.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper also proposes a similar approach for HMMs and IOHMMs, which are probabilistic models. The authors suggest using a more general type of a-priori knowledge, namely that the temporal dependencies are structured hierarchically, to avoid the problem of extracting long-term dependencies."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
