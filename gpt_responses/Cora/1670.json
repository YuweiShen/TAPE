This paper belongs to the Genetic Algorithms sub-category of AI. The text discusses the use of Genetic Algorithms to find a (near-)optimal solution using a limited amount of computation. It proposes simultaneous tuning of the selective pressure and the disruptiveness of the recombination operators to find a good balance between exploration and exploitation. The experiments conducted in the paper also show the effectiveness of this approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
