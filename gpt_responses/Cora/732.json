While the paper does touch on some practical applications of these theoretical results, such as expanding the class of distributions on which we can weakly learn monotone Boolean formulae, the majority of the content is theoretical in nature. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
