CBR is a subfield of AI that involves solving new problems by adapting solutions from similar past cases. The paper describes how the proposed memory model uses activation passing to retrieve relevant cases from memory and adapt them to solve new problems. This approach is a fundamental aspect of case-based reasoning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
