The authors address issues with the algorithm's design and implementation, and introduce new methods for on-line Bayesian calculations and maximum likelihood estimation. These are all examples of probabilistic methods in AI, which involve using probability theory to model uncertainty and make predictions or decisions based on uncertain data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
