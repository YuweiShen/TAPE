This approach combines genetic programming (GP) and genetic algorithms (GA) to evolve the controllers and robot bodies. The paper also discusses the success of evolving controllers for robots using genetic approaches. Therefore, the paper is most related to the sub-category of AI known as Genetic Algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
