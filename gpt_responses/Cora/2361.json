The hierarchical variable length representation used in the study is a key feature of Genetic Programming.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: Simulated Annealing and Stochastic Iterated Hill Climbing are both probabilistic search algorithms, which are compared to Genetic Programming in the paper. The authors note that it is not intuitively obvious that mutation-based adaptive search can handle program discovery, but their results show that SA and SIHC can also work for the GP problems they tested."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
