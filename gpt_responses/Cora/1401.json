The authors also mention the limitations of traditional Reinforcement Learning algorithms for repair-based optimization and propose a Case-Based Reasoning RL approach as a potential solution. Therefore, Reinforcement Learning is also a relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
