The authors also highlight the advantages of this approach, such as the ability to perform detailed experiments with different models and the efficiency of both training and prediction. The paper also emphasizes the precise quantitative semantics of the predictions generated by their probabilistic method, which is not shared by other classification methods. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Probabilistic Methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
