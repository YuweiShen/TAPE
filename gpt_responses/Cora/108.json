This paper belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI. The paper discusses the development of a formalism for approximating large probabilistic networks, which can be integrated with exact methods whenever they are applicable. The approximations used in the formalism maintain consistently upper and lower bounds on the desired quantities at all times. The paper also discusses the handling of Boltzmann machines, sigmoid belief networks, or any combination (i.e., chain graphs) within the same framework. The accuracy of the methods is verified experimentally."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
