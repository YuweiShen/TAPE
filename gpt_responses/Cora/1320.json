This paper belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks as it discusses the optimization of weight updates in neural networks. The authors propose centering all factors involved in the weight update, including the slope of hidden unit activation functions, to improve credit assignment in networks with shortcut connections and speed up learning without adversely affecting the trained network's generalization ability. The paper also references previous work on centering input and hidden unit activities and error signals in neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
