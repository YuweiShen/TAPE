This is a classic example of reinforcement learning where the agent learns from its own experience.\n\nProbabilistic Methods are also present in the text as the paper proposes a scheme for learning opponent action probabilities and a utility maximization framework that exploits this learned opponent model. This involves using probability distributions to model the opponent's behavior and using these models to make decisions that maximize the expected utility."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
