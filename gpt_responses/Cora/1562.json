The paper describes algorithms for extracting both conjunctive and M-of-N rules, and presents experiments that show that their method is more efficient than conventional search-based approaches. \n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks as it deals with understanding trained neural networks and extracting rules from them. The paper exploits the property that networks can be efficiently queried and presents a method that casts rule extraction not as a search problem, but instead as a learning problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
