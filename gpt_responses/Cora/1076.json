The algorithm is based on the computation of mutual information of attribute pairs, which is a common approach in probabilistic methods for feature selection and network structure learning. The paper also discusses the properties and guarantees of the algorithm in terms of its ability to generate a belief network close to the underlying model and its complexity in terms of conditional independence tests."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
