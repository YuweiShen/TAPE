Neural Networks: The paper discusses nonlinear extensions of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) neural networks and their learning rules. It also compares these networks with other signal expansions like Projection Pursuit (PP) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). \n2. Theory: The paper presents theoretical results on the separation of mixtures of real-world signals and images using the nonlinear PCA neural networks. It also relates the networks and their learning rules to other signal expansions like PP and ICA."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
