The paper focuses on constructing a simple and efficient indexing system structure using an incremental prototype-based neural network. While other sub-categories of AI may be indirectly related to the topic, such as rule learning or probabilistic methods, the main focus of the paper is on the use of neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
