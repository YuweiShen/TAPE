The approach, called First Order Regression (FOR), combines ILP and numerical regression to induce first-order logic descriptions that are amenable to numerical regression among real-valued variables. The program Fors is an implementation of this idea, where numerical regression is focused on a distinguished continuous argument of the target predicate. The paper describes applications of Fors on several real-world data sets, indicating that it is an effective tool for ILP applications that involve numerical data. \n- Theory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for combining ILP and numerical regression, and shows that FOR can be viewed as a generalisation of the usual ILP problem. The paper also discusses the properties of FOR and its relationship to other ILP approaches."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
