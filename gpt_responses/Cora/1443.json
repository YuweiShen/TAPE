The authors demonstrate that RL significantly improves the system's ability to recognize targets with fewer fixations by learning strategies for the acquisition of visual information relevant to the task and generalizing these strategies in ambiguous and unexpected scenario conditions. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Reinforcement Learning in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
