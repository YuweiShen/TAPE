The system consists of multiple layers of neural networks that process the SAR data at different scales to extract boundary and surface information. The authors also discuss the architecture and training of the neural system.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper discusses the use of probabilistic methods, specifically Markov random fields, for representing the extracted boundary and surface information. The authors explain how the probabilistic model can be used to improve the accuracy of the boundary and surface representation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
