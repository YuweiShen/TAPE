Decision trees are a probabilistic method used for classification and regression tasks. \n\nRule Learning: The paper also mentions that during training, a large number of features can be used and the decision tree will automatically choose the relevant subset. This is an example of rule learning, where the algorithm learns which features are important for making accurate predictions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
