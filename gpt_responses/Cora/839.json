The paper also discusses the use of backpropagation, which is a common neural network training algorithm.\n\nAdditionally, the paper also belongs to the sub-category of Reinforcement Learning as it discusses the use of a reward signal to guide the learning process. The authors propose a method for using a reward signal to improve the separation of signals in the presence of noise."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
