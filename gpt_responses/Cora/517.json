The approach is similar to the Query by Committee framework, where disagreement among the committee members on the predicted label for the input part of the example is used to signal the need for knowing the actual value of the label. The use of a committee of learners implies a probabilistic approach, where the committee members have different opinions on the predicted label, and the disagreement is resolved probabilistically."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
