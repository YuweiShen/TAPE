The paper proposes a new algorithm for reinforcement learning that is safe from divergence yet can still reap the benefits of successful generalization. \n\nNeural networks are also mentioned as a generalizing function approximator that can replace the lookup table in reinforcement learning. The paper discusses the success of using neural nets in the domain of backgammon, but also highlights the lack of guarantee of convergence when using function approximation. The proposed algorithm, Grow-Support, also utilizes neural networks as a function approximator."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
