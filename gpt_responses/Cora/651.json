This measure is based on probabilities and is used to search for relevant features. \n\nTheory: The paper discusses the problem of feature selection and proposes a new measure that is monotonic and fast to compute. The authors also discuss the limitations of existing error- or distance-based measures and explain why they are not monotonic. The paper presents experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed measure."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
