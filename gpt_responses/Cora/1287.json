The paper also discusses the use of inference and learning algorithms based on computing posterior probabilities, and compares exact and approximate methods for carrying out these computations. The paper's focus on probabilistic modeling and inference makes it most closely related to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods within AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
