The authors specifically mention that this method is useful for analyzing complex systems such as neural networks, which could also be considered a sub-category of AI. However, the focus of the paper is on the probabilistic method itself rather than its application to neural networks, so probabilistic methods is the most relevant sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
