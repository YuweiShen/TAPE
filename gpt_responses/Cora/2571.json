It proposes a non-deterministic, constraint-based parsing approach that assigns probabilities to different parse trees based on the likelihood of the constraints being satisfied. The paper also discusses the use of Bayesian networks to model the dependencies between different constraints.\n\nRule Learning: The paper also uses rule learning to generate the constraints used in the parsing approach. It describes a method for automatically learning rules from a corpus of annotated gene sequences. The learned rules are used to generate constraints that capture the syntactic and semantic properties of gene sequences."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
