The authors propose a rule-based approach to identify and learn exceptions to the standard chess rules. They use a set of predefined rules to identify exceptions and then use a decision tree algorithm to learn new rules based on the identified exceptions.\n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Reinforcement Learning because the authors use a reinforcement learning algorithm to evaluate the learned rules. They use a chess engine to simulate games and evaluate the performance of the learned rules. The reinforcement learning algorithm is used to adjust the weights of the rules based on the performance of the system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
