The ME model is compared to single networks, and the paper discusses how the ME model discovers regimes and characterizes sub-processes.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper discusses how the ME model matches the noise level of the data, which helps to avoid overfitting. The ME model is also able to characterize sub-processes through their variances, which is a probabilistic approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
