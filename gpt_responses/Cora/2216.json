The authors compare their hybridized approach to traditional Genetic Programming and show that it performs better in terms of fitness evaluations and success rate. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper mentions two traditional single point search algorithms: Simulated Annealing and Stochastic Iterated Hill Climbing, both of which are probabilistic methods. The authors combine these methods with a hierarchical crossover operator to create their hybridized approach. Additionally, the hill climbing component of their approach has options for generating candidate solutions using mutation or crossover, both of which involve probabilistic selection of individuals or genes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
