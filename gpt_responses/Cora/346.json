The model is inspired by the way that neurons in the brain synchronize their firing to create rhythmic patterns.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding how humans perceive time as phase. It discusses the concept of phase in detail and proposes a model that can account for the perception of rhythmic patterns. The paper also discusses the implications of the model for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying rhythmic perception."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
