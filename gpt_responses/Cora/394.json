The paper also mentions grants from the National Science Foundation and ONR/ARPA, which are both organizations that fund research in probabilistic methods. Additionally, the author mentions being supported by a Postdoctoral Fellowship from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and a NSF/CISE Postdoctoral Fellowship, both of which are likely to be related to probabilistic methods given the focus of the research center."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
