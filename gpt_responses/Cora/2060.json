The system allows for an imprecisely specified query and assesses if the retrieved items are relevant in the initial context specified in the query.\n- Probabilistic Methods: The paper discusses system evaluation with concerns on usefulness, scalability, applicability, and comparability. These are all aspects that can be evaluated using probabilistic methods, such as Bayesian networks or Markov models. However, the paper does not explicitly mention the use of any specific probabilistic method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
