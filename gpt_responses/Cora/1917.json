The authors use a genetic algorithm to evolve a set of filters that can be used to evaluate the strength of a given move. The fitness function used in the genetic algorithm is based on the performance of the filters in a game of Go.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper also discusses the use of reinforcement learning to train a neural network to play Go. The authors use a variant of Q-learning to train the network, with the goal of maximizing the expected reward over a game of Go. The network is trained using a dataset of expert moves, and the authors show that the trained network is able to play at a high level."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
