The Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation used in the paper is a probabilistic method.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper describes two reinforcement learning methods for generating an approximate value function on the production scheduling domain. The solution to the MDP is a value function which can be used to generate optimal scheduling decisions online."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
