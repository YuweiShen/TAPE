The authors use a Bayesian approach to estimate the parameters of the model and discuss the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for inference. The paper also discusses the use of prior distributions and model selection criteria, which are common in probabilistic modeling."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
