The paper also discusses the occurrence of \"fitness epochs\" and the innovations between them, which are specific to the finite population dynamics of the GA.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the dynamics of the GA, deriving closed-form expressions for the trajectories through fitness distribution space and the metastable fitness distributions during fitness epochs. The paper also analyzes the Jacobian matrices in the neighborhood of an epoch's metastable fitness distribution to reveal the state space's topological structure and derive quantitative predictions for a range of dynamical behaviors. The paper discusses the connections of the results with those from population genetics and molecular evolution theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
