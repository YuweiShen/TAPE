This involves evolving programs through genetic operations such as mutation and crossover.\n\nRule Learning: The paper describes the process of discovering programs that exactly reproduce a given finite prefix of a sequence and correctly produce the remaining sequence up to the underlying machine's precision. This involves learning rules or patterns in the sequence data. Additionally, the machine-language representation used in the paper contains instructions for arithmetic, register manipulation and comparison, and control flow, which can be seen as rules for manipulating data and controlling program flow."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
