The paper describes several algorithms for learning decision tables and compares their performance. \n\nProbabilistic Methods are also present in the text as the paper mentions Bayesian networks as one of the hypothesis spaces that machine learning researchers have concentrated on. However, the paper argues that decision table classifiers are more comprehensible for business users compared to these foreign hypothesis spaces."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
