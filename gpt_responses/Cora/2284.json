The TDNN is used to learn and predict repetitive memory access patterns for parallel processing applications.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper also discusses the use of a Markov predictor, which is a probabilistic method, to learn and predict memory access patterns for parallel processing applications. The Markov predictor is one of the three prediction techniques tested in the study."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
