The paper presents a baseline information-gain-weighted CBL algorithm and then proposes two variations of the algorithm that create test-case-specific feature weights to improve the performance of minority class predictions. \n\nThis paper also belongs to the sub-category of Rule Learning because the proposed variations of the CBL algorithm create test-case-specific feature weights by observing the path taken by the test case in a decision tree created for the learning task and using path-specific information gain values to create an appropriate weight vector for use during case retrieval. This process involves learning rules from the decision tree and using them to create case-specific feature weights."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
