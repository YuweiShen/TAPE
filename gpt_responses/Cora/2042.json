This paper belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks. The paper proposes a hybrid architecture of a decision tree and a neural network called the lazy neural tree (LNT) for smooth regression systems. The LNT inherits smoothness of the generated function, incremental adaptability, and conceptual simplicity from the neural network. The paper also mentions that the LNT out-performs traditional neural network simulations by the order of magnitudes in terms of efficiency. Therefore, the paper is primarily focused on the application of neural networks in regression systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
