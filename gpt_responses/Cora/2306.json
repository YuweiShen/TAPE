The authors discuss the challenges of using neural networks for this task, including the need to handle recursive processes and symbolic computation traditionally used in linguistic frameworks. They also compare the performance of different types of neural networks and non-neural network machine learning models.\n\nMachine Learning: The paper also falls under the sub-category of machine learning, as the authors explore various machine learning algorithms and techniques for training the neural networks and non-neural network models. They discuss the use of simulated annealing, decision trees, and nearest-neighbors algorithms, among others. The authors also highlight the importance of improving the convergence of gradient descent training algorithms for recurrent neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
