This paper belongs to the Neural Networks sub-category of AI. The paper investigates the dynamics and collective properties of feedback networks with spiking neurons and their potential computational role in associative memory. The paper shows that model systems with integrate-and-fire neurons can function as associative memories on two distinct levels, where binary patterns are represented by the spike activity and analog patterns are encoded in the relative firing times between individual spikes or between spikes and an underlying subthreshold oscillation. The paper suggests that cortical neurons may perform a broad spectrum of associative computations far beyond the scope of the traditional firing-rate picture."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
