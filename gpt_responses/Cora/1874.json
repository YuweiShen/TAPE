This paper belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks as it reports a Monte Carlo study of the dynamics of large untrained, feedforward, neural networks with randomly chosen weights and feedback. The analysis consists of looking at the percent of the systems that exhibit chaos, the distribution of largest Lyapunov exponents, and the distribution of correlation dimensions. The paper explores the behavior of artificial neural networks with random weights and feedback, which is a key area of research in the field of neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
