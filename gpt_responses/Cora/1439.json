Genetic Algorithms: The paper mentions the use of \"parallel high-level genetic algorithms\" for generating good solutions for perimeter minimization problems. This falls under the sub-category of Genetic Algorithms in AI.\n\n2. Theory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for solving optimization problems involving the assignment of grid cells to processors. It develops a lower bound on the perimeter of a tile as a function of its area and shows how to generate minimum-perimeter tiles. This falls under the sub-category of Theory in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
