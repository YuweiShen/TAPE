This is a classic example of case-based reasoning, where new cases are classified based on their similarity to previously observed cases.\n\nAdditionally, this paper also belongs to the sub-category of Rule Learning because it describes new types of K-nearest-neighbor procedures that estimate the local relevance of each input variable, or their linear combinations, for each individual point to be classified. This information is then used to separately customize the metric used to define distance from that object in finding its nearest neighbors. This is a form of rule learning, where rules are learned to customize the metric used in the classification process."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
