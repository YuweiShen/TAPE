The model is used to simulate the pattern of results in line bisection tests for patients with unilateral neglect.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper mentions that morsel has already been used to model data in a related disorder, neglect dyslexia. This suggests that the model uses probabilistic methods to make predictions about the behavior of patients with neurological disorders."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
