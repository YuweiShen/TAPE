The authors also mention the use of probability distributions in modelling learning biases.\n\nNeural Networks: The paper discusses generalist models of learning, which can be seen as a type of neural network. The authors also mention the isotropy of bias, which is related to the structure of neural networks.\n\nTheory: The paper proposes a refinement of the notion of innateness, which can be seen as a theoretical contribution to the field of AI. The authors also discuss the characteristics of bias and how they relate to different types of learning models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
