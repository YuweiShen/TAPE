The paper discusses the development of a library of assembly language routines for neural networks and an object-oriented RAP interface in C++ that allows programmers to incorporate the RAP as a computational server into their own UNIX applications. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI related to Neural Networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
