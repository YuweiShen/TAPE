For example, the authors mention \"probabilistic relevance models\" and \"Bayesian feature selection\" as approaches to feature selection.\n\nTheory: The paper also discusses theoretical advances in machine learning related to feature and example selection. The authors describe a general framework for comparing different methods and mention \"theoretical work in machine learning\" as a source of progress on these topics. Additionally, the paper closes with a discussion of challenges for future work in this area, which includes theoretical questions such as \"how to design algorithms that are robust to noise and outliers.\""}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
