It also mentions that explanations with uneven distributions of frequencies on transitions from a node will be preferred, suggesting a probabilistic approach.\n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Genetic Algorithms as it discusses the use of Evolutionary Programming for finding satisfactory approximately optimal explanations. The information theoretic measure of finite state machine explanations is used as the fitness function during the search for a near-optimal explanation, which is a common approach in Genetic Algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
