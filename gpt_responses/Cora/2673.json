The genetic algorithm is used to evolve the number of prototypes per class and their positions on the input space.\n- Case Based: The system uses a set of prototypes for each of the possible classes, and the class of an input instance is determined by the prototype nearest to this instance. This is a form of case-based reasoning, where new cases are classified based on their similarity to previously learned cases (prototypes)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
