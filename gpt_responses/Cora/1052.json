The model explains the stability of the network's activity profile and its ability to shift dynamically, and it is based on synaptic weight distribution components with even and odd symmetry. \n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding how the head-direction cell ensemble represents spatial orientation. The model is based on attractor dynamics and integrates self-motion information to derive a world-centered representation from observer-centered sensory inputs. The paper also discusses the modality-independence of the internal representation and the correction for cumulative error by putative local-view detectors."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
