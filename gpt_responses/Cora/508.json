This approach is inspired by the Boolean function decomposition approach to the design of digital circuits, which is a rule-based method. The paper also proposes a suboptimal heuristic algorithm to cope with high time complexity, which is a theoretical aspect of the method. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-categories of Rule Learning and Theory in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
