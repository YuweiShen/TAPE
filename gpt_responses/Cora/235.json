The circuit is modeled using triadic connections that are gated by signals indicating the direction of gaze. The neural model is exposed to sequences of stimuli paired with appropriate eye position signals in simulations. Therefore, the paper primarily focuses on the development of a neural network for visual stabilization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
