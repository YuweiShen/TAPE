This falls under the category of Rule Learning. The paper also discusses the declarative specification of the language bias, which determines the set of syntactically well-formed regularities, which is a theoretical aspect of the technique. Therefore, the paper also falls under the category of Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
