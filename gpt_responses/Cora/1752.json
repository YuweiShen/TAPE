These models are based on rules that represent the knowledge and methods used by the system. \n\nTheory is also present in the paper as the authors discuss the importance of explanation in building computer-based interactive design environments and analyze the content of explanations of design reasoning and design solutions. They also describe the use of a computer program, INTERACTIVE KRITIK, which uses these representations to visually illustrate the system's reasoning and the result of a design episode. This analysis and use of a computer program is based on theoretical concepts and principles."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
