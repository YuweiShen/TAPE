The focus is on how to extend the model to handle distributed cases, which is a key aspect of case-based reasoning. The other sub-categories of AI (Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Probabilistic Methods, Reinforcement Learning, Rule Learning, Theory) are not directly relevant to the content of the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
