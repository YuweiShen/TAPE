The authors derive bounds on the sample complexity required to learn these distributions, and they prove lower bounds on the performance of any learning algorithm. The paper also discusses the relationship between the sample complexity and the structure of the distribution being learned."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
