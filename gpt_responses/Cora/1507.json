The paper also compares the new approach with previous approaches in terms of uncertainty representation and interpretation. All of these aspects are related to probabilistic methods, which involve representing uncertainty using probability distributions and carrying out operations on these distributions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
