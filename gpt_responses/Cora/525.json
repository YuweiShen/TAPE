The MML theory is also described as the theory with the highest posterior probability. The paper also outlines how MML is used for statistical parameter estimation and how the MML mixture modelling program, Snob, combines parameter estimation with selection of the number of components. The paper discusses various probability distributions, including Gaussian, discrete multi-state, Poisson, and von Mises circular distributions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
