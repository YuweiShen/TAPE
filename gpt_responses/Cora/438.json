The system combines deterministic hill-climbing with two forms of randomization to find a good oblique split at each node of a decision tree. \n\nProbabilistic Methods are also present in the text as the article presents extensive empirical studies, using both real and artificial data, that analyze OC1's ability to construct oblique trees that are smaller and more accurate than their axis-parallel counterparts. The benefits of randomization for the construction of oblique decision trees are also examined."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
