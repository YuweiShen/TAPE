The NNPDA consists of a recurrent neural network connected to an external stack memory through a common error function. \n\nRule Learning: The paper discusses how the NNPDA is able to learn the dynamics of an underlying pushdown automaton from examples of grammatical and non-grammatical strings. The network learns the state transitions in the automaton, as well as the actions required to control the stack. The paper also discusses the use of hints to enhance the network's learning capabilities."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
