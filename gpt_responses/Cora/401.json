The paper discusses the spectrum of allowable dependence in a given probabilistic model, from the Naive Bayes algorithm at the most restrictive end to the learning of full Bayesian networks at the most general extreme. The paper analyzes the assumptions made as one moves along this spectrum and shows the tradeoffs between model accuracy and learning speed. The paper also presents a general induction algorithm that allows for traversal of this spectrum depending on the available computational power for carrying out induction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
