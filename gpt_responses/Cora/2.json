This paper belongs to the sub-category of Reinforcement Learning as it uses a RL method to find dynamic channel allocation policies that are better than previous heuristic solutions. The authors formulate the problem as a dynamic programming problem and use RL to solve it. They present results on a large cellular system and show that the policies obtained perform well for a broad variety of call traffic patterns."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
