The algorithm uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of modules that are evaluated based on their fitness in solving a given problem. The fittest modules are then selected for further evolution, while the weaker ones are discarded. This process is repeated until a satisfactory set of modules is obtained.\n\nRule Learning: The paper also discusses the use of decision trees as a means of acquiring modules. Decision trees are a type of rule-based learning algorithm that can be used to learn a set of rules that can be used to solve a given problem. The paper proposes a method for using decision trees to learn modules that can be used to solve new problems. The decision trees are trained on a set of training examples, and the resulting rules are used to construct a module that can be used to solve new problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
