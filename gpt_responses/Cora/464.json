The proposed postulates characterize belief revision as a process that may depend on elements of an epistemic state that are not necessarily captured by a belief set. The paper also establishes a model-based representation theorem which characterizes the proposed postulates and constrains the way in which entrenchment orderings may be transformed under iterated belief revision. These concepts are all related to probabilistic methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
