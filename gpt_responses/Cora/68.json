The method is based on Levin complexity and inspired by Levin's optimal universal search algorithm. The probabilistic search algorithm finds the \"good\" programs (the ones quickly computing algorithmically probable solutions fitting the training data).\n\nTheory: The paper reviews some basic concepts of algorithmic complexity theory relevant to machine learning, and how the Solomonoff-Levin distribution (or universal prior) deals with the prior problem. The method is based on Levin complexity (a time-bounded generalization of Kolmogorov complexity) and inspired by Levin's optimal universal search algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
