This paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Theory. The paper discusses different theories of rational inference and how they conflict with each other. It also adapts formal results from social choice theory to prove that every universal theory of default reasoning will violate at least one reasonable principle of rational reasoning. There is no mention of any other sub-categories of AI such as Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Probabilistic Methods, Reinforcement Learning, or Rule Learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
