The paper describes a psychologically plausible system that uses a focus of attention mechanism to locate target objects, which is a common approach in neural network models.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper discusses the computational complexity of the task of visual search and suggests that parallel feed-forward networks cannot perform this task efficiently. This suggests the need for probabilistic methods to improve the efficiency of the search. The paper also describes a strategy that combines top-down and bottom-up information to minimize search time, which is a common approach in probabilistic models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
