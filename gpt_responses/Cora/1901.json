The authors propose revision methods that aim to revise only those beliefs and plans worth revising, and to tolerate incoherence and ungroundedness when these are judged less detrimental than a costly revision effort. The authors also use an artificial market economy in planning and revision tasks to arrive at overall judgments of worth, which is a probabilistic approach to decision-making."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
