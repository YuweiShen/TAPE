The framework employs explanation-based learning (ebl) techniques to improve the retrieval of cases. \n- Reinforcement Learning: The paper mentions that the framework replays previous plan derivations and extends them to obtain a complete solution for a new problem. When the replayed path cannot be extended, ebl techniques are employed to identify the features of the new problem which prevent this extension. These features are then added as censors on the retrieval of the stored case. This process can be seen as a form of reinforcement learning, where the system learns from its past experiences to improve its future performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
