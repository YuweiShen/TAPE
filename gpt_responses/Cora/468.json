The paper also discusses the design of the transition kernel of the chain, which is a key aspect of MCMC, and the concept of Markov chain regeneration, which is a probabilistic method for allowing adaptation to occur infinitely often without disturbing the stationary distribution of the chain."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
