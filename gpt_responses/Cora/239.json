It also presents a new algorithm for computing an accurate value function in such spaces, and compares its performance with TD() on several domains. All of these are related to Reinforcement Learning, which is a sub-category of AI concerned with learning how to make decisions in an uncertain environment through trial-and-error interactions with the environment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
