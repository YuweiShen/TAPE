This process involves probabilistic reasoning and decision-making.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical perspective on the nature of belief and its relation to memory and decision-making. It argues for a view of belief as the result of rational representation, which is distinct from the traditional logical view of belief. The paper also discusses the limitations of the logical view and proposes a more illuminating alternative."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
