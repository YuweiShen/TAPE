The agents learn individually to activate particular behavioral assemblages given their current situation and a reward signal. The experiments evaluate the agents in terms of performance, policy convergence, and behavioral diversity. The degree of diversification and the performance of the team depend on the reward structure. Therefore, the paper primarily belongs to the sub-category of Reinforcement Learning in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
