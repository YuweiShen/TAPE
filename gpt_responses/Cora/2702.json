The method involves the use of genetic operators such as mutation and crossover to evolve the network architectures.\n\nNeural Networks: The paper deals with the combination of Evolutionary Algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks. The proposed method aims to find good building-blocks for architectures of Artificial Neural Networks by using Cellular Encoding and Genetic Programming. The paper also presents simulation results for two real-world problems using the proposed method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
