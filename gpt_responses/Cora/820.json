The authors describe how the nested networks are trained using backpropagation, which is a common technique used in neural network training. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of recurrent neural networks for temporal processing, which is another example of how neural networks are used in this context. Overall, the paper focuses on the use of neural networks for robot control, making it most closely related to this sub-category of AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
