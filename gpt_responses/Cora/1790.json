Genetic programming is a type of genetic algorithm that evolves computer programs to solve a specific problem. In this case, the problem is to create a board evaluation function that can evaluate the strength of a given chess position. \n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper uses reinforcement learning to train the evolved board evaluation functions. Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. In this case, the agent is the board evaluation function and the environment is the chess game. The function receives a reward or punishment based on how well it evaluates the strength of a given chess position."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
