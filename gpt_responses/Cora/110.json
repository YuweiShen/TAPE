The authors explain how SOMs can be used to visualize high-dimensional data and identify patterns within it. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper also discusses the use of probability distributions in SOMs. The authors explain how SOMs can be trained using a probabilistic approach, where each neuron in the network represents a probability distribution over the input data. This allows for the identification of clusters and outliers within the data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
