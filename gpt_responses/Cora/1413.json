This paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as theory refinement, as it demonstrates how theory refinement techniques can be used to build student models for intelligent tutoring systems. The paper discusses the use of theory refinement to introduce errors into a knowledge base, rather than correcting them, in order to generate more accurate student models. The approach is evaluated through a comprehensive experiment involving a large number of students interacting with an automated tutor for teaching concepts in C++ programming."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
