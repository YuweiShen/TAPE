The authors show that the upper bound for expected error of a learner which maximises the Bayes' posterior probability is within a small additive term of one which does the same from a mixture of positive and negative examples.\n\nRule Learning: The paper discusses the learnability of logic programs from positive examples only, which falls under the category of rule learning.\n\nTheory: The paper presents theoretical results related to the learnability of grammars and logic programs from positive examples only, and how this relates to Chomsky's theory of innate human linguistic abilities. The authors also describe an implementation of their approach and report results of testing it on artificially-generated data-sets."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
