The algorithm uses random sampling to explore the search space and make decisions based on probabilities.\n\nRule Learning: The paper is focused on the problem of grammar induction, which is a type of rule learning. The goal is to learn a set of rules that can generate a given language. The SAGE algorithm is designed to search for these rules in a probabilistic way."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
