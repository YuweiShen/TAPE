The authors propose a new algorithm called \"adaptive multiple penalization\" which penalizes each parameter individually and automatically adjusts the penalties based on a global regularization hyperparameter. The hyperparameter is estimated using resampling techniques, which is a common approach in probabilistic methods. The paper also compares the performance of their algorithm with other regularization techniques, such as ridge regression and variable selection, which are also probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
