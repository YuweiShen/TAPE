The approach used in the paper falls under the class of projection estimators, which is a probabilistic method for density estimation. The paper also discusses the use of wavelets, which are a mathematical tool used in probabilistic methods for signal and image processing. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
