The paper presents theoretical and empirical results on the disruptive effect of different forms of crossover in genetic algorithms. \n\nTheory is also a relevant sub-category as the paper summarizes recent theoretical results on the disruptive effect of multi-point crossover and uniform crossover. The paper also discusses the implications of the results on implementation issues and performance, and suggests several directions for further research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
