The authors describe a system called \"Analogical Design Assistant\" that uses a case-based approach to retrieve and adapt relevant design cases from a case library. \n\nAdditionally, the paper also belongs to the sub-category of Rule Learning AI because it discusses the use of rule-based systems to represent design knowledge. The authors describe how they used a rule-based system to encode design knowledge in the Analogical Design Assistant, and how the system uses these rules to generate new design solutions based on the retrieved cases."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
