This paper belongs to the Neural Networks sub-category of AI. The paper presents a new penalty term for neural networks that uses Principal Component Analysis to detect functional redundancy in the network. The paper also discusses how this new term can improve techniques that make use of a penalty term, such as weight decay, weight pruning, feature selection, Bayesian, and prediction-risk techniques, all of which are commonly used in neural network research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
