The model combines the self-organizing network with the radial basis function approach to achieve better results in classification tasks. The paper does not mention any other sub-categories of AI such as Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Probabilistic Methods, Reinforcement Learning, Rule Learning, or Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
