The authors also introduce a modification to the learning algorithm that takes into account the noise structure of the observed output. \n\nTheory: The paper presents theoretical results on the effect of noise on learning Markov chains with variable memory length. The authors show that despite the super-polynomial factors affecting learning, the algorithm is still viable in practical cases. The paper also discusses the original polynomial time learning algorithm introduced by Ron, Singer, and Tishby."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
