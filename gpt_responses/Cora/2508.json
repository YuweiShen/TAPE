The authors propose a method for constructing Bayesian network wrappers that can be used to improve the performance of existing machine learning algorithms.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper also discusses the use of oblivious decision graphs (ODGs) for reinforcement learning. The authors propose a method for constructing ODGs that can be used to learn optimal policies in a variety of settings. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several benchmark problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
