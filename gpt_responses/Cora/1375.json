The focus is on the implications of these priors for the corresponding priors over functions computed by the network, and how these priors can be defined in a way that allows for infinite networks without overfitting. The paper also explores the properties of different types of priors, including Gaussian and non-Gaussian stable distributions. Overall, the paper is primarily concerned with probabilistic methods for modeling neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
