The networks were trained on a database of face images that human subjects consistently rated as portraying a single emotion.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper discusses the model's response to limit and direct testing in determining if human subjects exhibit categorical perception in morph image sequences. This involves analyzing a linear sequence of morph images and observing sharp transitions in the output response vector, which suggests the presence of probabilistic methods in the model's approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
