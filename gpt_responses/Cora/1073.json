The focus is on the theoretical aspects of attribute estimation and the performance of the algorithm in different conditions, rather than on the application of a specific AI sub-category. While the paper mentions classification problems, it does not delve into the use of probabilistic methods, rule learning, or other sub-categories."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
