These models are probabilistic in nature, as they involve the estimation of probability distributions for various parameters and the use of Bayesian inference methods. The paper discusses the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for fitting these models, which are a common tool in probabilistic modeling.
