The experiments conducted in the paper show that different measures obtained by different probability estimation methods determine the preferential order of attributes in a given node, which in turn determines the structure of a constructed decision tree. \n\nRule Learning: The paper analyzes two well-known measures for attribute selection in decision tree induction, informativity and gini index. These measures are used to determine the preferential order of attributes in a given node, which is then used to construct a decision tree. This process can be seen as a form of rule learning, where the rules are represented by the decision tree."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
