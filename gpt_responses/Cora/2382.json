These methods extend techniques from regression analysis to the analysis of censored survival data, and involve probabilistic modeling of the conditional hazards function. The paper compares two specific methods, Survival Trees and HARE, which both use probabilistic methods to model survival data. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
