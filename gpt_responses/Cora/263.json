Theoretical issues are also backed by prediction results for benchmark time series and computer generated data sets. \n\nNeural Networks: The non-linear model proposed in the paper is demonstrated to be sufficiently rich in approximating unknown functional forms, yet it retains some of the simple and intuitive characteristics of linear models. The architecture of the model is also emphasized, and a comparison to some more established non-linear models is made. Inference pertaining to the data structure is also made from the parameterization of the model, resulting in a better understanding of the structure and performance of the model."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
