The approach evaluates a hypothesis as a whole rather than one clause at a time, and the heuristic is incorporated in an ILP system called Lime. The paper also discusses the theoretical properties of the Bayesian approach and presents experimental results comparing Lime to other ILP systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
