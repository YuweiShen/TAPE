SOM is a type of artificial neural network that can learn to represent high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. The authors use SOM to simulate the development of orientation maps in the visual cortex, which is a well-known phenomenon in neuroscience. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The authors introduce a modification to the SOM model that breaks the rotational symmetry of the input space. They do this by introducing a probabilistic term in the update rule of the SOM, which biases the learning towards certain orientations. The authors show that this modification leads to the emergence of pinwheel-like structures in the orientation map, which is also observed in real neural tissue. The probabilistic term is derived from a statistical model of the input distribution, which is assumed to be Gaussian."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
