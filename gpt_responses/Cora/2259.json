The authors review the main results in the theory of schemata in GP and conduct experiments to study the creation, propagation, and disruption of schemata in real runs for different genetic operators. \n\nTheory: The paper also presents a new GP schema theory based on a new definition of schema. The authors discuss the results of their experiments in the light of this new theory and draw conclusions about the behavior of schemata in GP."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
