This approach is based on genetic algorithms, which are used to evolve the controller of the robot in simulation. \n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper also mentions that the robot is trained to locate, recognize, and grasp a target object. This training is done using reinforcement learning, which involves providing the robot with feedback on its actions and adjusting its behavior accordingly."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
