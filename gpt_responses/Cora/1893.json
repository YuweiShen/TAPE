The performance of this network is compared with standard BackPropagation on a sample problem. \n\nRule Learning: The paper investigates an algorithm for the construction of decision trees comprised of linear threshold units. Littlestone's Winnow algorithm is also explored within this architecture as a means of learning in the presence of many irrelevant attributes. The learning ability of this Madaline-style architecture on nonoptimal (larger than necessary) networks is also explored."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
