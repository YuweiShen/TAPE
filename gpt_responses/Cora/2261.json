The paper also presents experimental evidence comparing one-point crossover with standard crossover. \n- Theory: The paper describes the theoretical properties and features of one-point crossover and its variant, strict one-point crossover. The authors also highlight the usefulness of these operators from a theoretical point of view."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
