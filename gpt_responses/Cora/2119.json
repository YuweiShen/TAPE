The neural net is used to interpret the sensor data and identify the type of gas present. The authors also discuss the training of the neural net using backpropagation and the use of a hidden layer to improve the accuracy of the system. Therefore, the paper heavily relies on the use of neural networks for gas identification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
