The model exhibits compositionality, which is a property commonly associated with neural networks. The other sub-categories of AI (Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Probabilistic Methods, Reinforcement Learning, Rule Learning, Theory) are not directly relevant to the content of this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
