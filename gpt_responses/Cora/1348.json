This involves identifying relevant pieces of information (indices) in a given situation that trigger the relevant schema in the system's memory. This is similar to how a case-based reasoning system would identify relevant cases based on their similarity to the current situation. \n- Rule Learning: The paper discusses two methods using which the system can identify the relevant schema even if the input does not directly match an existing index, and learn a new index to allow it to retrieve this schema more efficiently in the future. This involves learning new rules or conditions for selecting the appropriate schema based on the input."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
