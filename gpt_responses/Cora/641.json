The authors investigate various methods for approximating this posterior, which is a common problem in probabilistic methods. The specific model family they use for their experiments is finite mixture distributions, which is a probabilistic model. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Probabilistic Methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
