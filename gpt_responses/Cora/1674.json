The paper explores how judgments of similarity and soundness can be modeled using SME, a simulation of Gentner's structure-mapping theory. The focus is on explicating several principles which psychologically plausible algorithms should follow, and introducing the Specificity Conjecture. The paper does not involve the use of Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Probabilistic Methods, Reinforcement Learning, or Rule Learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
