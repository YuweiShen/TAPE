The paper discusses the design considerations and empirical results of a case-based planning system that uses CBR to guide its case adaptation and similarity assessment. The paper also explores the potential of learning to acquire the knowledge needed for CBR systems, which is a key characteristic of case-based AI. The other sub-categories of AI (Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Probabilistic Methods, Reinforcement Learning, Rule Learning, Theory) are not directly related to the content of the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
