The paper analyzes the learning curve for this type of problem and explores methods for estimating the expected return per unit time. \n\nTheory is also a relevant sub-category, as the paper uses methods from statistical mechanics to calculate lower bounds on the agent's performance in the thermodynamic limit. The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the problem and derives lower bounds on the return of policies based on imperfect statistics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
