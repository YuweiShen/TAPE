The paper also describes how the KRITIK2 system implements and evaluates the model-based method for learning indices to design cases.\n- Theory: The paper proposes a model-based method for learning indices to design cases using structure-behavior-function (SBF) models. The SBF model of a design provides the functional and causal explanation of how the structure of the design delivers its function. The paper also discusses how the prior design experiences stored in case-memory help to determine the level of index generalization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
