The backend processing involves mapping queries using \"facts\" and \"rules\" that establish correspondences among the data in the databases. The approach is implemented using a deductive database system as the rule processing engine. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Rule Learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
