The paper specifically addresses the performance overheads of evolving a large number of data structures, which is a common issue in Genetic Programming. The paper proposes a solution to this problem through the use of a formally-based representation and strong typing, which is a technique commonly used in Genetic Algorithms. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of Genetic Algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
