The paper specifically examines the role of test suites in evaluating evolutionary search algorithms, which are a type of genetic algorithm. \n\nTheory is also relevant as the paper discusses basic principles for developing test suites and examines the characteristics of existing test functions. The paper also proposes new methods for constructing test functions with different degrees of nonlinearity, which involves theoretical considerations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
