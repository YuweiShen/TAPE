The paper compares the performance of these two methods with human learning on the NRL Navigation task. \n\nAction models are also present in the text as a novel variant of control knowledge acquisition that is compared to reinforcement learning. The paper's results indicate that the performance of the action models approach more closely approximates the rate of human learning on the task than does reinforcement learning or the hybrid. The paper also explores the impact of background knowledge on system performance by adding knowledge used by the action models system to the benchmark reinforcement learner, elevating its performance above that of the action models system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
