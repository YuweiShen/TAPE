The training procedure is a generalization of recurrent backpropagation to complex-valued units.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper does not explicitly mention probabilistic methods, but the system described, MAGIC, learns how to group features based on a set of presegmented examples. This suggests that the system is using some form of probabilistic learning to discover grouping heuristics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
