The authors use Bayesian networks to represent the relationships between different variables and to calculate the probability of different hypotheses.\n\nTheory: This paper also belongs to the category of theory as it proposes a new theoretical framework for understanding everyday abductive explanation. The authors argue that abductive explanation involves the generation of hypotheses based on prior knowledge and experience, and the evaluation of these hypotheses based on their coherence with the available evidence and their compatibility with the agent's goals. They also propose a set of principles for evaluating the plausibility of different hypotheses and for selecting the most promising ones."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
