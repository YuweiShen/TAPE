The focus is on constructing better estimators that make use of the structure of the transition distribution of the sampler. This falls under the category of probabilistic methods.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the performance of the standard empirical estimator and the newly constructed estimators. The authors derive expressions for the asymptotic variance of the estimators and evaluate their performance in a simulation study.
