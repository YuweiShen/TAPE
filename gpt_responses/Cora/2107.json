The paper also examines the distribution of false splice sites and links it to a possible scenario for the splicing mechanism in vivo. The paper reports the percentage of false positive predictions and the average number of false donor and acceptor sites per true site. These are all examples of probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
