The approach is based on designing a representation for cooperation strategies that can be manipulated by GPs. The experiments presented in the paper also show promising results using this approach. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Genetic Algorithms in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
