This approach is used in the system's induction capacity, which generates conclusions from common instances of terms and combines evidence from different sources.\n\nRule Learning: The paper focuses on the components of NARS that contribute to the system's induction capacity, which includes an induction rule that generates conclusions from common instances of terms and a revision rule that combines evidence from different sources. These rules are used to learn from experience and adapt to new situations.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a new approach for induction from a non-axiomatic logical point of view. It discusses the semantic foundation that underlies NARS's induction, deduction, and abduction capabilities, and how these types of inference cooperate in the system's activities. The paper also discusses the system's control mechanism, which enables knowledge-driven, context-dependent inference."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
