The paper evaluates the potential of GP for this purpose and introduces structure-preserving genetic operators.\n\nRule Learning: The paper focuses on the problem of discovering a controller for mobile robot path tracking using fuzzy logic and evaluates the performance of incomplete rule-bases compared to a complete FLC designed by trial-and-error. The paper also introduces a constrained syntactic representation for the learned rules."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
