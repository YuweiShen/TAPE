The authors propose a subregion-adaptive integration algorithm that uses a probabilistic model to estimate the location and height of the dominant peak in each subregion. This probabilistic model is based on the assumption that the function values in each subregion follow a Gaussian distribution.\n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Theory because it presents a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm. The authors derive the convergence rate of the algorithm and prove that it achieves the optimal convergence rate for functions with a dominant peak. They also provide a complexity analysis of the algorithm and show that it has a polynomial time complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
