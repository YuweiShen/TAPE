The paper also discusses how RL methods involve propagating information backward from the goal toward the starting state, which is similar to the process used in EBL. \n\nExplanation-Based Learning is also a key component of the paper, as it is the basis for the development of EBRL. The paper discusses how EBL computes the weakest preconditions of operators and performs propagation on a region-by-region basis, which is different from RL methods that perform propagation on a state-by-state basis. The paper also compares the performance of EBRL to standard EBL."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
