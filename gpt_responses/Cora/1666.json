This paper belongs to the sub-category of probabilistic methods because it discusses the non-parametric estimation of probability density functions using weight functions. The paper proposes a new method that requires almost linear time and derives conditions for convergence under different metrics. The paper also compares the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method with kernel-based estimators."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
