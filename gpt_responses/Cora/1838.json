The approach is based on clustering the samples and using Bayesian prototype vectors to represent the conditional probabilities of each cluster. The likelihood of the Bayesian tree is also evaluated. \n\nNeural Networks: The Bayesian network constructed in the paper can be realized as a feedforward neural network capable of probabilistic reasoning. The paper describes the process of learning in this framework, which involves choosing the size of the prototype set, partitioning the samples into clusters, and constructing the cluster prototypes. The paper also presents a greedy heuristic for searching through the space of different partition schemes with different numbers of clusters to find an optimal approximation of the probability distribution."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
