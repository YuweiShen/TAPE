The authors use a neural network model to simulate the cognitive processes involved in fast mapping, which involves quickly learning the meaning of a new word based on limited exposure to it. \n\nThis paper also belongs to the sub-category of Theory because it presents a theoretical framework for understanding the fast mapping phenomenon. The authors propose a computational model of fast mapping that is based on the idea that the brain uses statistical learning to infer the meaning of new words based on their context. They also discuss how their model relates to existing theories of language acquisition and cognitive development."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
