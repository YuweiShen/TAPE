The paper describes a genetic algorithm that can handle release times of jobs and uses a preceding simulation method to improve the performance of the algorithm. The job shop is regarded as a nondeterministic optimization problem arising from the occurrence of job releases, and Temporal Decomposition leads to a scheduling control that interweaves both simulation in time and genetic search. Therefore, the paper primarily belongs to the sub-category of Genetic Algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
