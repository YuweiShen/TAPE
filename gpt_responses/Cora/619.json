The authors propose a probabilistic graphical model that can be used to estimate causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding variables.\n\nTheory: This paper also belongs to the sub-category of theory as it presents a theoretical framework for mediating instrumental variables. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the problem of unobserved confounding variables and how it can be addressed using instrumental variables. They also discuss the limitations of existing methods and propose a new approach based on Bayesian networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
