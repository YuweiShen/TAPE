The paper also discusses the application of the EM algorithm to two specific probabilistic models: mixture of Gaussian densities and hidden Markov models. The paper does not discuss any other sub-categories of AI such as Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Rule Learning, or Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
