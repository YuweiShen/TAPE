The paper also introduces an extension to H-learning, which automatically explores the unexplored parts of the state space, while always choosing greedy actions with respect to the current value function. \n\nProbabilistic Methods are also present in the paper, as the exploration methods studied (random, recency-based, or counter-based exploration) are all probabilistic in nature."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
