This paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Neural Networks. The paper discusses the use of neural networks for adaptive control and estimation of nonlinear systems using gaussian radial basis functions. It also presents an algorithm for stable, on-line adaptation of output weights simultaneously with node configuration in a class of non-parametric models with wavelet basis functions. The paper focuses on the merging of concepts from nonlinear dynamic systems theory with tools from multivariate approximation theory to develop more efficient system representations while preserving global closed-loop stability."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
