The model combines a laterally connected self-organizing map with spiking neurons with leaky integrator synapses to achieve both self-organization and segmentation in a unified network. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Neural Networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
