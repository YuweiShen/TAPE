The network uses unsupervised Hebbian relaxation to learn to recognize the objects and develop compact representations of the input views.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper does not explicitly mention the use of probabilistic methods, but the network's ability to generalize to novel views of the same objects suggests that it is using probabilistic reasoning to some extent. Additionally, the simulated psychophysical experiments suggest that the network's behavior is qualitatively similar to that of human subjects, which is often a goal of probabilistic modeling in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
