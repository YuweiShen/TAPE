The paper proposes a method for maintaining a compact approximation to the true belief state, which is a probabilistic approach to inference. The paper also mentions dynamic Bayesian networks, which are a probabilistic graphical model used to represent complex stochastic processes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
