This paper belongs to the sub-category of probabilistic methods because it uses Bayesian methods to select covariates in hierarchical models of hospital admission counts. The authors use Bayes factors to compare models with different sets of covariates and select the model with the highest Bayes factor as the best model. The paper also discusses the use of prior distributions and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in Bayesian analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
