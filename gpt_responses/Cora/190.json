It uses a bivariate normal distribution to model the joint distribution of the hormones and estimates the parameters using maximum likelihood estimation. The paper also discusses the use of Bayesian methods for model selection and inference.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for spline smoothing of bivariate data. It discusses the use of penalized likelihood to estimate the smoothing parameters and the choice of the penalty function. The paper also provides theoretical results on the convergence of the spline estimator and the asymptotic properties of the estimator."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
