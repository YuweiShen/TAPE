The paper presents an algorithm that generalizes explanation structures to acquire recursive and iterative concepts, which can be applied using a PROLOG-like problem solver. The focus is on generalizing the structure of explanations, which helps avoid negative effects of learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
