The paper compares the performance of these systems in inducing recursive relations from small datasets. \n\nTheory is also a relevant sub-category as the paper presents a hypothesis about the extension of LOPSTER and empirically evaluates its ability to induce recursive relations. The paper also discusses the advantage of basing induction on logical implication rather than subsumption, which is a theoretical concept in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
