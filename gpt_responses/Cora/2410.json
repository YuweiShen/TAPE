The model is based on separating the tasks of segmenting the input word sequence into clauses, forming the case-role representations, and keeping track of the recursive embeddings into different modules. The system needs to be trained only with the basic sentence constructs, and it generalizes not only to new instances of familiar relative clause structures, but to novel structures as well. The ability to process structure is largely due to a central executive network that monitors and controls the execution of the entire system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
