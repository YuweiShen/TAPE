It reviews previous work on attribute selection and presents a new algorithm, Oblivion, that carries out greedy pruning of oblivious decision trees, which effectively store a set of abstract cases in memory.\n- Rule Learning: The Oblivion algorithm prunes decision trees based on the relevance of features, which can be seen as learning rules for selecting relevant features. The paper also discusses the implications of their experiments for future work on irrelevant features, which could involve further rule learning approaches."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
