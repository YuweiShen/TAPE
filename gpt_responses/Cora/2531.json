This involves identifying clusters of utility functions that minimize an appropriate distance measure, which is a probabilistic method.\n\nCase Based: The proposed method involves classifying a new user's utility function based on similarity to previously collected utility functions, which is a case-based approach. The paper discusses how this approach is more efficient and robust than traditional utility elicitation methods based solely on preferences."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
