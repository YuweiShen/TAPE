The key idea is to keep statistics in the space of possible short-term memories, which is a common approach in reinforcement learning. The paper also presents experimental results in a partially observable maze and a difficult driving task with visual routines, which are typical domains for reinforcement learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
