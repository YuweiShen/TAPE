The algorithm is based on a hypothesis-boosting method, which is a common technique in neural network learning. \n- Theory: The paper discusses the theoretical properties of the algorithm, including its ability to PAC-learn a natural class of target concepts. The authors also provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm's performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
