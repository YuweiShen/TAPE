Bayesian nets are a type of probabilistic method used for modeling uncertain relationships between variables.\n\nCase Based: The paper also describes the use of case-based reasoning (CBR) for determining how to implement actions in multiagent planning tasks. The authors propose an integration of Bayesian networks and CBR, where the former provides environmental context and feature selection information for the latter. The paper surveys previous integrations of Bayesian and case-based approaches in the context of CBR task decomposition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
