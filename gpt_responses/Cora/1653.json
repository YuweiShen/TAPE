They also distinguish a number of dimensions along which redesign problem-solving methods can vary. \n\nTheory is present in the paper as the authors present a knowledge-level analysis of redesign, viewing it as a family of methods based on common principles. They also propose extending the current notion of possible relations between tasks and methods in a PSM architecture to include the notions of task refinement and method refinement, which represent intermediate decisions in a task-method structure."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
