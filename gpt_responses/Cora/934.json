It also talks about the effects of crossover probability, maximum depth or length of solutions, explicit parsimony, and modularization on the evolution of solutions.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a hypothesis and provides a basis for an analysis of the effects of compression pressure on the evolution of solutions in genetic programming systems. It also suggests ways to overcome the negative implications of compression pressure for successful evolution. Additionally, an empirical investigation is presented to support the hypothesis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
