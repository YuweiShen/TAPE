Additionally, the ML-Modeler component uses machine learning techniques to infer the student's learning methods and generate hypotheses about their misconceptions and errors, which can also be seen as a probabilistic approach to modeling the student's knowledge state."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
