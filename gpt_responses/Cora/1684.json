These methods exploit local information provided by different contexts to provide a global view and recognize contextual attributes. This approach involves probabilistic methods to estimate attribute quality.\n\nRule Learning: The paper discusses how Relief and its extension Re-liefF are capable of recognizing contextual attributes. This involves learning rules that capture the dependencies between attributes and how they affect the classification problem. The paper also introduces Regressional ReliefF (RReliefF), which provides a unified view on estimating attribute quality and can be used for non-myopic learning of the regression trees. This approach involves rule learning to estimate attribute quality."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
