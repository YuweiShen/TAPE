The paper goes on to describe the \"incremental self-improvement\" method, which is a reinforcement learning algorithm that allows each animat to improve its own policy over time. While other sub-categories of AI may be involved in the implementation of this method, such as neural networks or probabilistic methods, the focus of the paper is on reinforcement learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
