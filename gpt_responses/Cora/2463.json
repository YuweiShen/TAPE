The paper proposes a new method for learning network structure from incomplete data, which is based on an extension of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for model selection problems. The paper also describes how to learn networks in two scenarios: when the data contains missing values, and in the presence of hidden variables. All of these are examples of probabilistic methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
