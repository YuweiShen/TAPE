The paper analyzes the performance of these algorithms in an on-line learning framework, where the goal is to estimate a discounted sum of all the reinforcements that will be received in the future. \n\nTheory is also a relevant sub-category, as the paper provides general upper and lower bounds on the performance of the learning algorithms, without making any statistical assumptions about the process producing the training sequence. The authors also analyze the closely related problem of learning to predict in a model where the learner must produce predictions for a whole batch of observations before receiving reinforcement."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
