The method involves exploring the space of parameter values using best-first search and cross-validation, which is a form of rule learning. The paper also discusses the theoretical basis for the method and reports experimental results, indicating that it is effective in improving the performance of the learning algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
