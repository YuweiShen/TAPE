The focus of the paper is on the construction of prior distributions, which are a fundamental component of Bayesian inference. The paper reviews various techniques for constructing priors, including Jeffreys's rules, which are based on probabilistic considerations. The paper also discusses the practical and philosophical issues that arise when using priors constructed by formal rules. Therefore, the paper is most closely related to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods within AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
