The proposed solution to the problem of slow mixing in high dimensional and strongly correlated density functions involves augmenting the state space with multiple chains in parallel and using a genetic-style crossover operator to update individual chains. The methodology is also extended to deal with variable selection and model averaging in high dimensions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
