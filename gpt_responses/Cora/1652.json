The network uses a competitive neural circuit to bind visual elements together into a representation of a visual object, and information about the spiking pattern of neurons allows transfer of the bindings of an object representation from location to location in the neural circuit as the object moves.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theory of visual relative motion perception that explains how neural circuits can group moving visual elements relative to one another, based upon hierarchical reference frames. The theory is based on Gestalt common-fate principles and exploits information about the behavior of each group to predict the behavior of individual elements. The model exhibits characteristics of human object grouping and solves some key neural circuit design problems in visual relative motion perception."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
