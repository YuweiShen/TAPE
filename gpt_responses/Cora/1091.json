The model is implemented in a biologically feasible, hierarchical neural circuit.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The model uses a maximum likelihood cost function to allow the scheme to be implemented in a biologically feasible, hierarchical neural circuit. The simulations demonstrate the utility of temporal context in modulating plasticity and the model learns a representation that categorizes people's faces according to identity, independent of viewpoint, by taking advantage of the temporal continuity in image sequences. The model also learns a two-tiered representation, starting with a coarse view-based clustering and proceeding to a finer clustering of more specific stimulus features."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
