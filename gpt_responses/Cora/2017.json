The approach involves selecting a subset of features that maximize predictive accuracy prior to the network learning phase, and the paper explicitly examines the effects of feature selection and node ordering on the learning process. The goal is to construct networks that are simpler to evaluate but still have high predictive accuracy relative to networks that model all features. Therefore, the paper is primarily focused on probabilistic methods for learning Bayesian networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
