It also mentions the optimization of the objective function by solving a large-scale quadratic programming problem with linear and box constraints. These are all related to neural networks.\n\nTheory: The paper discusses the derivation of Support Vector Machines, its relationship with Structural Risk Minimization (SRM), and its geometrical insight.
