The framework presented, CoCo, uses ECL i PS e to generate constraints and chromosome representations for the neural networks, and GENOCOP to find an optimal solution. This involves the use of genetic algorithms to optimize the error of the network, and the use of neural networks as the subject of the optimization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
