The network has bottom-up \"recognition\" connections and top-down \"generative\" connections that are used to convert sensory input into underlying representations and reconstruct the sensory input from the representations, respectively. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper describes a learning algorithm that involves a \"wake\" phase and a \"sleep\" phase, where the network is driven by recognition and generative connections, respectively. The synaptic learning rule is simple and local, and the combined effect of the two phases is to create representations of the sensory input that are efficient in terms of the number of bits required to describe them. The paper also discusses the use of probabilistic models to represent uncertainty in the sensory input and the representations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
