These models are based on neural networks that process sensory information. The chip itself employs a correlation model, which is a type of neural network that is commonly used for motion detection.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The chip uses subthreshold analog VLSI techniques, which are probabilistic in nature. These techniques allow for the chip to operate at low power and with high efficiency. Additionally, the chip reports the one-dimensional field motion of a scene in real time, which requires probabilistic methods to estimate the motion of objects in the scene."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
