These trading rules are then used on out-of-sample data to demonstrate that they can profit from the SMFM model. The paper emphasizes the utility of blending an intuitive and powerful mathematical-physics formalism to generate indicators which are used by AI-type rule-based models of management."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
