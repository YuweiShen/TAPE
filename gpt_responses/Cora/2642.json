Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. In this paper, the computer program learns to play games by receiving feedback in the form of a score or win/loss outcome. Temporal difference learning is a specific type of reinforcement learning algorithm that updates the value function of the agent based on the difference between predicted and actual rewards. Artificial neural networks are used to represent the value function and make predictions about future rewards. Therefore, this paper primarily belongs to the sub-category of Reinforcement Learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
