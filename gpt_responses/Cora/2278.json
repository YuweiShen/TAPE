The ANN functions as a parallel computer for generating routes and can be implemented using optics, making it especially appealing for an optical computing environment. The paper discusses the advantages of using a neural network routing scheme, such as fault-tolerance and faster computation for OMINs with irregular structures. Therefore, the paper primarily belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
