The model is used to identify the behavioral mode of the animal and directly identify the corresponding collective network activity. The segmentation of the data into discrete states also provides direct evidence for the state dependency of the short-time correlation functions between the same pair of cells, which is another example of probabilistic modeling."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
