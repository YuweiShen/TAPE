The embedded-particle models introduced in the paper are evaluated by comparing their estimated performances with the actual performances of the CAs they model, which is a common approach in genetic algorithm-based research.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a framework for describing the emergent computational strategies observed in evolved CAs, which can be considered a theoretical contribution to the field of AI. The authors also show that their framework captures the main information processing mechanisms of the emergent computation that arise in these CAs, which further supports the theoretical nature of the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
