The concept of culling overlarge litters is also a common technique in genetic algorithms.\n\nNeural Networks: The paper focuses on the population of neural nets and how their behaviors can be used as a form of culture to improve neuro-evolution. The technique of teaching offspring using backpropagation is also a common method in neural network training."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
