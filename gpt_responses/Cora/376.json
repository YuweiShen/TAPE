This approach involves using full joint probability models for exploratory data analysis. The paper also presents a case study using a data set from an educational study, demonstrating the application of the Bayesian classification approach. Therefore, the paper primarily belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
