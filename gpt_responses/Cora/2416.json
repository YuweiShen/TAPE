The prior distribution imposed on the wavelet coefficients is designed to capture the sparseness of wavelet expansion common to most applications. The posterior median yields a thresholding procedure. The paper also establishes a relation between the hyperparameters of the prior model and the parameters of Besov spaces, which gives insight into the meaning of the Besov space parameters. The paper proposes a standard choice of prior hyperparameters that works well in their examples. All of these aspects are related to probabilistic methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
