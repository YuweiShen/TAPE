The paper also presents a novel measure for evaluating performance improvements in reinforcement learning, called the \"reinforcement acceleration criterion\" (RAC), and a method called \"environment-independent reinforcement acceleration\" (EIRA) that is guaranteed to achieve RAC. \n\nTheory is also a relevant sub-category, as the paper presents a sound theoretical framework for meta-learning and multi-agent learning, based on the principles of reinforcement acceleration and the EIRA method. The paper also discusses the limitations of existing reinforcement learning algorithms and the challenges of policy modification processes in unknown environments, highlighting the need for a new approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
