The paper discusses the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning methods and proposes a methodology for designing the representation and the reinforcement functions that take advantage of implicit domain knowledge in order to accelerate learning in dynamic, situated multi-agent domains characterized by multiple goals, noisy perception and action, and inconsistent reinforcement. \n\nProbabilistic Methods are also present in the paper as the authors discuss the noisy perception and action in multi-agent domains and propose a methodology that takes into account the uncertainty in the environment."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
