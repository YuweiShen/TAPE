The paper discusses how Bayesian methods can be used to create adaptive models that can update their predictions as new data becomes available. The paper also discusses how Bayesian methods can be used to incorporate prior knowledge into the model, which is a key feature of probabilistic modeling. While other sub-categories of AI may also be relevant to the topic of adaptive models, the focus on Bayesian methods makes probabilistic methods the most closely related sub-category."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
