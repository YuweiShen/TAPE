The authors modify the canonical coding of the symmetric TSP to create a coding scheme for this problem, and show that genetic operators act intelligently on this coding scheme. They also implement an asynchronous parallel genetic algorithm on a computer network and discuss computational results. Therefore, the paper primarily belongs to the sub-category of Genetic Algorithms in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
