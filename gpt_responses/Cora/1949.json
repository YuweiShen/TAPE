The focus is on the theoretical properties of the algorithm, such as global convergence without additional regularity assumptions and achieving local superlinear rate of convergence under standard assumptions. There is no mention of any specific application or use of AI sub-categories such as case-based, genetic algorithms, neural networks, probabilistic methods, reinforcement learning, or rule learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
