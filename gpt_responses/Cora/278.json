The authors discuss various algorithms and techniques for working with these models, including the inside-outside algorithm and the expectation-maximization algorithm. The paper also includes experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of these methods. While the paper does not explicitly discuss other sub-categories of AI, it is primarily concerned with probabilistic modeling and inference, which falls under the umbrella of probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
