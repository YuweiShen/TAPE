The authors also discuss the theoretical underpinnings of their model, including the use of analogical reasoning and the role of working memory in problem solving. While other sub-categories of AI may be relevant to this research (such as neural networks for modeling cognitive processes), the focus of the paper is primarily on rule-based approaches and theoretical frameworks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
