The paper discusses the use of crossover and program size restrictions in GP, which are key components of genetic algorithms.\n\nTheory: The paper presents theoretical models and experimental evidence related to the behavior of GP populations. The paper discusses Price's Covariance and Selection Theorem, which is a theoretical result in evolutionary biology that has been applied to genetic algorithms. The paper also discusses the covariance between gene frequency and fitness in the first few generations of GP runs, which is a theoretical concept in evolutionary biology."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
