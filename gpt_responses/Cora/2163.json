The proposed method, speculative hedge, aims to minimize the penalty suffered by other paths when instructions are speculated along a path, by controlling over-speculation and eliminating unnecessary speculation that delays any path's exit. This approach involves probabilistic reasoning and decision-making based on the likelihood of different paths being taken at run time."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
