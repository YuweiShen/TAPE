This paper belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks in AI. The paper presents a performance prediction method for MIMD parallel processor systems for neural network simulations. The method is validated by applying it to two popular neural networks, backpropagation and the Kohonen self-organizing feature map. The paper focuses on the performance of parallel neural network simulations, which is a key aspect of neural network research and development."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
