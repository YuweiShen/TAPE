This paper belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI. The paper discusses the use of graphical decision-modeling formalisms such as belief networks and influence diagrams, which provide a compact representation of probabilistic relationships and support inference algorithms that automatically exploit the dependence structure in such models. The paper also discusses the limitations of these graphical decision models and proposes a knowledge-based model construction approach to generate decision models dynamically at run-time based on the problem description and information received thus far."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
