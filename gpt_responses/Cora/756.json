This involves probabilistic reasoning to combine the knowledge from different sources.\n\nRule Learning: The paper describes the methodology of knowledge integration, which involves constructing an integrated knowledge base from several separate sources. This involves learning rules from the separate knowledge bases and combining them to form a single system. The implemented system (INTEG.3) is also described, which uses rule-based reasoning to integrate knowledge."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
