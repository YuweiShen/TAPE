This paper belongs to the sub-category of probabilistic methods because it discusses the use of graphical models for causal inference and path analysis. The paper specifically mentions the use of recursive structural equations models, which are a type of probabilistic graphical model. The author also discusses the use of probability theory in modeling causal relationships between variables."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
