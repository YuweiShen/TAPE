The authors embed a sequential procedure within the evolutionary algorithm to improve its performance. The paper discusses the use of mutation and crossover operators, which are common components of genetic algorithms. Therefore, the paper is most related to the sub-category of Genetic Algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
