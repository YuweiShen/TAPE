The schema hierarchy is learned from examples through unsupervised adaptation and reinforcement learning.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper mentions that the schema hierarchy is learned through unsupervised adaptation and reinforcement learning. The VISOR system learns that some objects are more important than others in identifying the scene, and that the importance of spatial relations varies depending on the scene. As the inputs differ increasingly from the schemas, VISOR's recognition process is remarkably robust, and automatically generates a measure of confidence in the analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
