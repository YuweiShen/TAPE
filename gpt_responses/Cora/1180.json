The authors propose an algorithm for testing subsumption of determinate clauses, which is important in inductive logic programming (a subfield of rule learning).\n- Theory: The paper presents theoretical results on the complexity of subsumption testing and its relation to the clique problem. The authors also propose a pruning rule based on prior knowledge, which is a theoretical contribution."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
