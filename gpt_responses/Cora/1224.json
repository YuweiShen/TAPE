The authors view supervised classification as an optimization problem and evolve rule sets that maximize the number of correct classifications of input instances. They also use a variant of the Pitt approach to genetic-based machine learning system with a novel conflict resolution mechanism between competing rules within the same rule set.\n\nRule Learning: The paper focuses on evolving rule sets for classification using a genetic algorithm.
