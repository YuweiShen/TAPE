The authors previously formalized case combination as a constraint satisfaction problem, and in this paper they propose a method to improve case adaptability using a genetic algorithm. \n- Genetic Algorithms: The paper proposes a method to improve case adaptability using a genetic algorithm. The authors introduce a fitness function and perturb a sub-solution to allow subsequent case combination to proceed more efficiently."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
