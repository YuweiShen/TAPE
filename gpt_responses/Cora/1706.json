This model is based on probabilistic methods, as it takes into account the probability of each rule being executed and the probability of each inference path being followed.\n\nRule Learning: The paper discusses the use of a cost-model in designing a knowledge-based system. This cost-model is based on the structure of the system, which includes the rules used in the system. Therefore, the paper is related to the sub-category of Rule Learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
