These measures are based on probabilistic methods and are used to calculate the relevance and importance of different attributes.\n\nTheory: The paper also introduces a new function based on the MDL principle, which is a theoretical concept used in information theory. The function is designed to estimate the quality of multi-valued attributes and is based on the idea that the best model is the one that minimizes the description length of the data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
