The authors also mention the use of simple methods like neighbor-joining, which are based on probabilistic models of sequence evolution. The paper does not mention any other sub-categories of AI such as case-based reasoning, genetic algorithms, neural networks, reinforcement learning, rule learning, or theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
