The paper presents a biologically motivated mechanism for self-organizing a neural network with modifiable lateral connections. The weight modification rules are purely activity-dependent, unsupervised, and local. The lateral interaction weights are initially random but develop into a \"Mexican hat\" shape around each neuron. This self-organizing feature map demonstrates how self-organization can bootstrap itself using input information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
