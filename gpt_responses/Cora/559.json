The paper discusses how H-learning can be scaled up to handle large state spaces by approximating the domain models and the value function. \n\nProbabilistic Methods are also present in the paper, as the authors propose to represent the action models and reward functions in the form of Bayesian networks. This allows for more efficient learning and inference in domains with large state spaces."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
