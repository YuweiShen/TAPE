The algorithm is based on the computation of mutual information of attribute pairs, which is a common approach in probabilistic methods for constructing Bayesian networks. The paper also discusses the correctness proof and analysis of computational complexity, which are important aspects of probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
