The algorithm uses a fitness function to evaluate the performance of each network and then applies genetic operators such as crossover and mutation to generate new networks. The process is repeated until a satisfactory solution is found. \n\nNeural Networks: The paper focuses on the topological optimization of neural networks, which involves finding the optimal structure of the network for a given task. The proposed genetic algorithm is used to search for the optimal topology by generating and evaluating different network structures. The paper also discusses the use of backpropagation for training the optimized networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
