These methods involve probabilistic reasoning and decision-making.\n\nRule Learning: The proposed method uses a partial-memory approach, which means that in each step of learning, the system remembers the current concept descriptions and specially selected representative examples from the past experience. This approach involves learning rules from examples and using them to make predictions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
