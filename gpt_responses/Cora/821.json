The authors develop a linear programming algorithm that creates a succession of small linear programs to separate chunks of the data at a time, and prove that this procedure is monotonic and terminates in a finite number of steps at an exact solution that leads to a globally optimal separating plane for the entire dataset. The paper does not involve any of the other sub-categories of AI listed."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
