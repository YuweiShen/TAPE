The system uses a pyramid of feature maps to visualize the taxonomy and lay out the topology of each level. \n\nCase Based: The paper describes how the recognition taxonomy, i.e. the breakdown of each script into tracks and roles, is extracted automatically and independently for each script from examples of script instantiations in an unsupervised self-organizing process. This process resembles human learning in that the differentiation of the most frequently encountered scripts become gradually the most detailed. The resulting structure serves as memory organization for script-based episodic memory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
