The controllers are selected based on the performance of the models, and an automatic network construction algorithm is used to make the IPMCN a self-organizing non-linear controller. This network can be considered a type of neural network, as it is composed of interconnected nodes that perform computations.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper describes a closed loop reference model method to design a controller from an odd polynomial model. This method involves using a feedback loop to adjust the controller based on the performance of the system, which is a key aspect of reinforcement learning. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of local controllers capable of handling systems with complex dynamics, which is a common approach in reinforcement learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
