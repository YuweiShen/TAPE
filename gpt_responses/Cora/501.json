It discusses how these networks constructively build up network structures that encode information from environmental stimuli at successively higher resolutions as needed for the tasks that the network has to perform. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper discusses biases for efficient learning of spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal patterns in connectionist networks. It examines how these biases guide the system to focus its efforts at the minimal adequate resolution, ensuring the parsimony of learned representations. The paper also discusses extensions of the basic algorithm for efficient learning using multi-resolution representations of spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal patterns, which involve probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
