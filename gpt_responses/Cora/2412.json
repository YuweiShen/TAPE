The approach involves two predistorters at each end of the communication channel co-adapting using the output of the other predistorter to determine their own reinforcement. The paper also discusses the success of the system in compensating for distortions using reinforcement learning. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Reinforcement Learning in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
