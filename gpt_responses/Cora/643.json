This involves using past cases to inform future reasoning. \n- Reinforcement Learning: The ROBBIE system implements a model of its planning processes to improve the planner in response to reasoning failures. This involves using feedback (reinforcement) to adjust the system's behavior."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
