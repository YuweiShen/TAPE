Machine learning is a probabilistic method that involves learning from data and making predictions based on probabilities. \n\nMemory-Based Learning: The paper focuses on the use of memory-based learning (MBL) for developing NLP modules. The examples presented in the paper are all trained using MBL, and the authors argue that MBL is applicable to a large class of other NLP tasks. MBL is a type of machine learning that involves storing and retrieving instances from memory to make predictions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
