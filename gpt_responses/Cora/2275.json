This paper belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks as it discusses the CLONES library, which is an object-oriented library for constructing, training, and utilizing layered connectionist networks. The library includes database, network behavior, and training procedures that can be customized by the user. The primary goal of the library is to run efficiently on data parallel computers, and the secondary goal is to allow heterogeneous algorithms and training procedures to be interconnected and trained together. The paper also mentions maximizing the variety of artificial neural network algorithms that can be supported."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
