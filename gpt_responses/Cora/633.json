The title of the paper explicitly mentions Reinforcement Learning, and the abstract describes the paper as being about \"Reinforcement Learning for Planning and Control.\" The paper discusses various reinforcement learning algorithms and their applications in planning and control.\n\nProbabilistic Methods are also present in the paper, as the authors discuss the use of probabilistic models in reinforcement learning. For example, the authors mention the use of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) in reinforcement learning.\n\nNeural Networks are also mentioned in the paper, as the authors discuss the use of neural networks in reinforcement learning. For example, the authors mention the use of deep reinforcement learning, which involves using deep neural networks to approximate the value function or policy in reinforcement learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
