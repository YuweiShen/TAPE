The algorithm was compared with a baseline algorithm and found to significantly improve the classification of normal vs. ventricular beats. The use of a neural network is central to the algorithm's ability to adapt to individual patients and improve classification accuracy."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
