The method uses censored input data and produces accurate predicted rates of recurrence while maintaining accuracy on individual predicted recurrence times. The paper does not mention any other sub-categories of AI such as Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Rule Learning, or Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
