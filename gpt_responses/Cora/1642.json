The authors describe how they use probabilistic inference to reason about the likelihood of different treatment options and their potential outcomes.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper also describes how the CHIRON system uses reinforcement learning to improve its performance over time. The system learns from feedback provided by medical experts and adjusts its decision-making process accordingly. The authors discuss how they use a combination of model-based and model-free reinforcement learning techniques to balance exploration and exploitation in the domain."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
