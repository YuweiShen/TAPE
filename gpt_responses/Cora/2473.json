The paper also discusses the study of two parameters: the point on the satisficing-optimizing scale that is used during the search carried out during problem-solving time and during learning time.\n\nReinforcement Learning is present in the text as the paper discusses the utility of macros in problem-solving and how the strategy used during problem-solving affects the efficiency of problem solvers. The paper also discusses the sensitivity of deductive learners to the type of search used during learning and how optimizing search improves the efficiency for problem solvers that require a high level of optimality."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
