Boosting is a probabilistic method that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. \n\nTheory: The paper gives a formal framework for the problem of combining preferences and analyzes the RankBoost algorithm. The paper also discusses two experiments carried out to assess the performance of RankBoost."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
