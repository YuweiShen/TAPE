The proposed method, Incremental Reduced Error Pruning, is also a rule learning algorithm. \n- Probabilistic Methods: The paper mentions \"noisy domains\", which suggests the presence of uncertainty or probability in the data. The proposed method also uses a probabilistic approach to determine which rules to prune."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
