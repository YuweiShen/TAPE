The authors build structured mixture models that mix linear regression models with respect to site-binding selection mechanisms, and they discuss problems and pitfalls in modeling and analysis. They also describe the use of hierarchical random effects components to capture heterogeneities in both the site binding mechanisms and the levels of effectiveness of compounds once bound."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
