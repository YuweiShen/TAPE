The approach is based on the idea of similarity-based reasoning, where the similarity between a new example and the cases in the case base is used to determine the prediction. This is a key characteristic of case-based reasoning, which is a subfield of AI that focuses on using past experiences to solve new problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
