GP is a type of genetic algorithm that uses natural selection and genetic recombination to evolve solutions to a problem.\n- Collective Intelligence: The paper describes the integration of distributed search with collective memory to form a collective adaptation search method. This approach leverages the collective intelligence of a group of agents to improve search performance. The paper also compares the performance of a collective memory search using a random search engine to a GP-based search engine, highlighting the importance of collective intelligence in complex search problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
