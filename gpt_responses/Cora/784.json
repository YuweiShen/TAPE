Bayesian methods are a type of probabilistic method that involve the use of prior distributions to model uncertainty about parameters, and posterior distributions to update these distributions based on observed data. The paper also mentions the use of stochastic simulation for posterior analysis, which is a common technique in Bayesian inference."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
