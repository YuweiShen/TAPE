The paper presents a new analytical method to derive conditions for the emergence of structure in SOMs, which is particularly suited for the high-dimensional variant of SOMs. The paper also discusses a SOM-based model for the development of orientation maps. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
