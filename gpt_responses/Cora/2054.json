The paper also shows that if the problem of minimizing the number of disagreements with a sample from among concepts in a class H can be approximated to within a factor k, then there is a simple tracking algorithm for H which can achieve a probability * of making a mistake if the target movement rate is at most a constant times * 2 =(k(d + k) ln 1 * ), where d is the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of H."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
