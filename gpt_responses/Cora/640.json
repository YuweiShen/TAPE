The paper presents general methods for bounding the rate of error tolerable by any learning algorithm, efficient algorithms tolerating nontrivial rates of malicious errors, and equivalences between problems of learning with errors and standard combinatorial optimization problems. The paper does not discuss any specific implementation or application of machine learning algorithms, which are the focus of other sub-categories such as Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, or Rule Learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
