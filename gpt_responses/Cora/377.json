The HME is viewed as a tree structured classifier, and the paper proposes a likelihood splitting criteria to adaptively grow the tree during training. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper also proposes a method to prune branches away from the tree by considering only the most probable path through the tree. This approach is based on probabilistic methods, as it involves selecting the most likely outcome based on the probabilities assigned to each path in the tree."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
