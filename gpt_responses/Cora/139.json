Simulated annealing is a type of genetic algorithm that uses a probabilistic approach to search for optimal solutions.\n\nTheory: The paper investigates the generality of Automatically Defined Functions (ADFs) in solving genetic programming problems. It analyzes the performance of simulated annealing with ADFs as compared to not using ADFs on a suite of even-k-parity problems. The paper also compares the performance of simulated annealing with ADFs to that of standard genetic programming with ADFs on the even-3-parity, even-4-parity, and even-5-parity problems. The analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of ADFs in solving genetic programming problems and the limitations of simulated annealing as an optimization algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
