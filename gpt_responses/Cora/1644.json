The distributed output code developed by Sejnowski and Rosenberg is used to show that BP consistently out-performs ID3 on this task.\n\nRule Learning: The paper explores three hypotheses explaining the difference in performance between BP and ID3, one of which is that ID3 is overfitting the training data. The paper also suggests augmenting ID3 with a simple statistical learning procedure to improve its performance.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper suggests that BP captures statistical information that ID3 does not, and that more complex statistical procedures can improve the performance of both BP and ID3 substantially. The study of residual errors also suggests that there is still substantial room for improvement in learning methods for text-to-speech mapping."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
