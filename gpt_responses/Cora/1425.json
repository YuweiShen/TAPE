The paper applies the Minimum Message Length (MML) criterion to this problem, which is a probabilistic method for model selection. The paper also compares the MML criterion with other criteria prominent in the literature for estimating the number of components in a data set. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
