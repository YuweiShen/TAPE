Machine learning techniques are applied to optimize these probabilities using a standardized training set. The GHMM is flexible and modular, providing simple solutions for integrating cardinality constraints, reading frame constraints, \"indels\", and homology searching. The paper also discusses the performance of the model compared to other gene-finding systems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
