This involves incorporating prior knowledge about the distribution of the data and using it to make probabilistic predictions.\n\nRule Learning: The paper focuses on the TDIDT (Top-Down Induction of Decision Trees) algorithm, which is a rule learning method used to construct decision trees. The modification proposed in the paper involves changing the way the leaves of the tree are constructed, which affects the rules that are generated and the interpretation of the tree."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
