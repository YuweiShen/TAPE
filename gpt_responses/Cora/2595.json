This paper belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks. The paper proposes a new architecture for predictive models for financial data based on neural networks. The architecture includes an interaction output layer and a new internal preprocessing layer connected with a diagonal matrix of positive weights to a layer of squashing functions. The paper applies these ideas to the real-world example of daily predictions of the German stock index DAX and compares the results to a network with a single output. The architectures are compared from both the training perspective and the trading perspective."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
