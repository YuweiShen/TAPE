This is a typical problem-solving task that falls under the category of case-based reasoning.\n- Rule Learning: The framework proposed in the paper is based on an explicit representation of the illocutionary and rhetorical structure underlying documents. This representation enables the construction of documents by issuing goal-based specifications and rapidly retrieving documents with similar intentional structure, which involves the use of rules for document drafting."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
