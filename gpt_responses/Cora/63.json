The paper also analyzes the theoretical properties and efficiency of the conventional and replacing trace methods. Therefore, reinforcement learning is the most related sub-category of AI. \n\nTheory is also applicable as the paper provides a theoretical analysis of the replacing trace method and its comparison to the conventional trace method. The paper shows that the replacing trace method results in faster and more reliable learning, and is closely related to the maximum likelihood solution for the tasks analyzed."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
