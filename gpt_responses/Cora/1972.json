The focus of the paper is on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which are intensive simulation techniques used to perform Bayesian analysis when the evaluation of Bayes posterior distribution is difficult. The paper also discusses model selection, which is a common problem in probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
