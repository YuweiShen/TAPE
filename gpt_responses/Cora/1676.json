Reinforcement Learning is present in the paper as the authors propose a TD learning algorithm to learn game evaluation functions. The algorithm uses a reward signal to update the weights of the neural network. Neural Networks are also present in the paper as the authors use a hierarchical neural architecture to learn the game evaluation functions. The architecture consists of multiple layers of neural networks, with each layer learning a different level of abstraction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
