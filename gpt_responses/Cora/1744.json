The SSN is a type of neural network.\n\nRule Learning: The paper reports on experiments in language learning using a recursive grammar, where the network is trained on sentences with specific rules and restrictions on constituent classes. The SSN is able to learn and generalize these rules to sentences with more complex structures and unrestricted constituent classes. This demonstrates the ability of the SSN to learn and apply rules, making it a type of rule learning algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
