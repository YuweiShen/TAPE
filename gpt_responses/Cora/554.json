This paper belongs to the sub-category of Reinforcement Learning as it focuses on developing new RL algorithms for solving average-payoff Markovian decision processes. The paper discusses the limitations of existing RL algorithms that focus on maximizing the discounted sum of payoffs and proposes new algorithms that are specifically designed for maximizing the average payoff received per time step. The paper also presents preliminary empirical results to validate these new algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
