Bayesian networks are a type of probabilistic graphical model that can be used to represent uncertain relationships between variables.\n\nRule Learning: The paper also discusses the use of rule-based systems to represent design knowledge. Rule-based systems use a set of if-then statements to represent knowledge and make decisions. The paper describes how these rules can be learned from examples using machine learning techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
