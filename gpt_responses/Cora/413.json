This paper belongs to the Theory sub-category of AI. The paper discusses the problem of approximating a function using a linear combination of n translates of a given function and uses a lemma by Jones and Barron to show that it is possible to define function spaces and functions for which the rate of convergence to zero of the error is O( 1 p n ) in any number of dimensions. The paper also describes a constructive iterative procedure that can achieve this rate. The paper does not discuss Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Probabilistic Methods, Reinforcement Learning, or Rule Learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
