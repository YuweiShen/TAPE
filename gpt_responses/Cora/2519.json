The solver uses a population of candidate solutions and applies genetic operators such as mutation and crossover to generate new solutions. The fitness of each solution is evaluated based on the constraints and optimization criteria of the problem. The paper compares the performance of the evolutionary solver to other solvers, including a biased random solver and a biased hillclimber solver. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Genetic Algorithms in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
