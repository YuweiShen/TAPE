The study presents a new pruning method that adapts the pruning strength during training based on the evolution of weights and loss of generalization. The paper extensively experiments with 14 different problems to compare the performance of different pruning methods and early stopping. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI, i.e., Neural Networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
