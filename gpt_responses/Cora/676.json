Each stage is constructed as a competitive network utilizing a modified Hebb-like learning rule, called the trace rule, which enables neurons to learn about whatever is invariant over short time periods in the representation of objects as the objects transform in the real world.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The trace rule learning algorithm used in the model is a probabilistic method that enables neurons to learn the statistical invariances about objects during their transformations, by associating together representations which occur close together in time."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
