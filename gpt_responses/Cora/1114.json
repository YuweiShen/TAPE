The simulation experiments also involve the use of genetic algorithms to explore pattern recognition in the immune system. While the paper does touch on other AI sub-categories such as pattern recognition and learning, the focus is on the use of genetic algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
