The algorithm employs a multiplicative update rule derived using a framework introduced by Kivinen and Warmuth. \n\nTheory is also present in the paper as the authors present a theoretical framework for their algorithm and provide mathematical proofs for its performance. They also compare their algorithm to other existing algorithms and provide theoretical explanations for the differences in performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
