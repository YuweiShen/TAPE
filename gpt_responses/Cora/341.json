The method is based on probabilistic reasoning and provides an unbiased estimate with high accuracy. The coefficient of variation is inversely proportional to p MU, where M is the number of hard locations in the memory and U the length of data. This indicates the use of probabilistic methods in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
