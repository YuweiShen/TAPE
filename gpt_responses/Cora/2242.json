The study involves the minimax rates of convergence over a range of Besov function classes and global L0p error measures. The paper also mentions the use of a Gaussian white noise model in a Mallows metric. These are all probabilistic methods commonly used in non-parametric estimation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
