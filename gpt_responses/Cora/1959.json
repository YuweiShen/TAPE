ARL uses genetic operators such as mutation and crossover to evolve the procedural representations of control policies. \n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper discusses a typical reinforcement learning problem of controlling an agent in a dynamic and nondeterministic environment. ARL is used to construct policies for this problem by discovering subroutines that correspond to agent behaviors. The paper also mentions the advantages of procedural representations in reinforcement learning tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
