The authors argue against the use of discounted rewards and propose an alternative approach to address the effect of noise and explain the parameters involved in the learning process. The empirical results presented in the paper also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in the context of reinforcement learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
