The paper also discusses the use of probability distributions to model the behavior of computer viruses.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding the problem of protecting computer systems as a problem of self-nonself discrimination. It also includes mathematical analysis of the computational costs of the proposed method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
