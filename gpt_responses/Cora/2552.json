The learned bases are Gabor-like in structure and higher degrees of overcompleteness produce greater sampling density in position, orientation, and scale. The paper also demonstrates the improvement in the representation of the learned bases by showing superior performance in image denoising and filling-in of missing pixels."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
