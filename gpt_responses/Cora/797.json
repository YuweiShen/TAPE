The paper also reports findings related to the behavior of the network, including the effect of semantic neighborhood density on response times, and the impact of changing the stopping criterion on the results. Therefore, the paper is primarily focused on neural network methods and their application to natural language processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
