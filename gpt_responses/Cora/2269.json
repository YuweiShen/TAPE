The paper also introduces a new form of genetic programming called PDGP, which is based on a graph-like representation for parallel programs and uses crossover and mutation operators to manipulate the chromosomes. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Genetic Algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
