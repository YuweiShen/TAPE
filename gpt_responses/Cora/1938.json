The paper also uses Bayesian methods to estimate the parameters of the models. \n\nIt also belongs to the sub-category of Theory because it explores the concept of monotonicity in item response models, which is a theoretical property of the models. The paper discusses both latent and manifest monotonicity, which are theoretical concepts related to the ordering of item difficulties and the ordering of item responses, respectively."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
