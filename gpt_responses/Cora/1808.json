The paper also empirically characterizes domains in which SE-trees are advantageous, which falls under the category of theory in AI research. The other sub-categories of AI (Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Probabilistic Methods, Reinforcement Learning) are not directly relevant to the content of this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
