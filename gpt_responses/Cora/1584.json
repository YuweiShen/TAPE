The paper also presents a theory of optimal similarity measures and proves the optimality of a specific similarity measure within a restricted class. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Case Based AI. Additionally, the paper presents a theory of optimal similarity measures, which falls under the sub-category of Theory in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
