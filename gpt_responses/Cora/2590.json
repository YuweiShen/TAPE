The scheme combines backfitting algorithm with iterative imputation algorithm in order to save both computational space and time. The convergence of this algorithm and various ways to further speed it up, such as collapsing component functions and successive over-relaxation, are discussed. These are all probabilistic methods used in the paper.\n\nRule Learning: The paper discusses issues related to the application of the proposed scheme in spatial-temporal analysis. An application to a global analysis of historical surface temperature data is described. These are examples of rule learning in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
