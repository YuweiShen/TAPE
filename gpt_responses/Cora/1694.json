The paper presents numerical results for a number of test functions, which are commonly used in evaluating the performance of genetic algorithms. The use of genetic operators and control parameters is also mentioned, which are key components of genetic algorithms. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of Genetic Algorithms in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
