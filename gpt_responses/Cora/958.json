Genetic programming is a type of genetic algorithm that evolves computer programs to solve a specific problem. \n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper discusses the evolution of intelligent agents that build internal representations of their successive actions. This is a characteristic of reinforcement learning, where agents learn from the consequences of their actions to maximize a reward signal."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
