These observations are used to support or weaken the case for a generalisation of a concept. This is a characteristic of case-based reasoning, where past experiences are used to solve new problems. \n- Rule Learning: The program uses a partial matching algorithm to find substitutions that enable two states to be unified. The generalisation of the two states is their unifier. This process involves learning rules that can be applied to new situations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
