The algorithm is used to learn rules from data and is based on a probabilistic approach. The paper also discusses the use of probability in evaluating the quality of the learned rules. Therefore, the paper also belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
