This is a classic example of rule learning, where the algorithm learns rules to make decisions. \n\nNeural Networks are present in the text as the algorithm constructs each test by training a linear machine. Linear machines are a type of neural network that can be used for classification tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
