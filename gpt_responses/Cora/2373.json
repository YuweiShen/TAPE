The method is used in the context of multi-variate time series prediction on financial data from the New York Stock Exchange. The paper also compares the performance of neural networks to linear models.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The method presented in the paper allows for forecasting a probability distribution, as opposed to the traditional case of just a single value at each time step. The paper demonstrates this on a strictly held-out test set that includes the 1987 stock market crash."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
