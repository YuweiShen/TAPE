The use of probability distributions and statistical models is a key aspect of this approach. While other sub-categories of AI may also be relevant to this research (such as neural networks for classification or reinforcement learning for decision-making), the emphasis on probabilistic methods is most prominent."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
