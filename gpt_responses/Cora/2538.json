The paper also mentions the use of activation functions and hidden layers, which are common components of neural networks.\n\nAdditionally, the paper also belongs to the sub-category of Reinforcement Learning because it discusses the use of a reward function to train the network. The paper mentions the use of a cost function that penalizes the network for deviating from the desired output, which is a common approach in reinforcement learning. The paper also mentions the use of a learning rate, which is a common parameter in reinforcement learning algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
