The paper also discusses the class of graphical Markov models determined by acyclic digraphs (ADGs), which is another probabilistic method. The paper does not discuss any other sub-categories of AI such as Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Rule Learning, or Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
