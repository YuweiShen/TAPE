Case Based: The paper describes an algorithm that uses past errors to create partitions in the domain being approximated. This is similar to how case-based reasoning systems use past cases to make decisions. However, the paper does not explicitly mention case-based reasoning or any specific case-based reasoning techniques.\n\n2. Theory: The paper proposes a new algorithm that uses the error distribution generated by a learning algorithm to create piecewise learnable partitions. The paper discusses the importance of the error distribution and how it can be used to improve the learning process. The paper also describes the algorithm in detail and provides experimental results. This is an example of theoretical research in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
