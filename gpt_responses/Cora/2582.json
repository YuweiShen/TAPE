The method is applied to the prediction of daily foreign exchange rates, and the paper discusses the limitations and difficulties of using neural networks for processing high noise, small sample size signals.\n\nRule Learning: The paper discusses the extraction of symbolic knowledge from the recurrent neural networks in the form of deterministic finite state automata. These automata explain the operation of the system and are often relatively simple. Rules related to well-known behavior such as trend following and mean reversal are extracted."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
