It describes the different types of cells and their connections, which form a complex network. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper uses statistical analysis to interpret the experimental results. It discusses the probability of certain events occurring and the significance of the findings. For example, it calculates the probability of a cone cell responding to a particular stimulus and compares it to the probability of a random response."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
