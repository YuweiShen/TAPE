The Tilde system, which is presented and evaluated, is an implementation of this framework for inducing logical decision trees. \n- Theory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for inducing logical decision trees, which are more expressive than flat logic programs typically induced by empirical inductive logic programming systems. The paper also discusses the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach and provides empirical evaluation results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
