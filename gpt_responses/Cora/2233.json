The paper also describes the NETMORC architecture and its simplified algorithmic implementation.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper mentions that after an initial learning phase, the controller can move the robot to an arbitrary stationary or moving target while compensating for noise and other forms of disturbance, such as wheel slippage or changes in the robot's plant. This suggests that the controller is using reinforcement learning to adapt to changes in the environment and achieve its goal."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
