They use a one-step lookahead greedy algorithm using the learned evaluation function to outperform the best existing algorithm for this task. \n\nNeural Networks are present in the paper as the authors approximate the value function using a 2-layer feedforward network of sigmoid units. They use this approximation to improve the performance of the scheduling algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
