The focus is on reducing the computational complexity of probabilistic inference in networks with multiple similar states. While the paper does not explicitly mention other sub-categories of AI, it is clear that the approach taken falls under the umbrella of probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
