This process involves using mutual information to make decisions and merging nodes at the same level of the tree. These techniques fall under the category of rule learning. The paper also discusses a new pruning mechanism that works top down starting from the root, which is a theoretical aspect of the algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
