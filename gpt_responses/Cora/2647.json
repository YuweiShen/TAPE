Dynamic programming is a key component of reinforcement learning, which involves learning to make decisions based on rewards and punishments received from the environment.\n\nTheory is also present in the text as the paper discusses the development of procedures to solve complex planning and control problems using second order local trajectory optimization. The paper also discusses the maintenance of global consistency of local models of the value function, which is a theoretical concept in dynamic programming."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
