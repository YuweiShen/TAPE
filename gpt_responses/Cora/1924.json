The proposed algorithms are similar to the EM (Baum-Welch) algorithm, which is a probabilistic method commonly used for training HMMs. The paper also uses a distance measure based on relative entropy between two HMMs, which is a probabilistic concept. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
