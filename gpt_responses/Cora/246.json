The method involves integrating over the entire parameter space, which is a key characteristic of probabilistic methods. The paper also discusses mixture distributions, which are a type of probabilistic model. Monte Carlo simulation is used to perform the Bayesian inference, which is a common technique in probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
