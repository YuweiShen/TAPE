This paper belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI. The paper presents a new Markov chain sampling method for distributions with isolated modes. The method uses a series of distributions that interpolate between the distribution of interest and a distribution for which sampling is easier. The method involves systematic movement from the desired distribution to the easily-sampled distribution and back to the desired distribution. The paper discusses the efficiency of the method in simple and complex distributions and how it compares to simulated tempering. The entire paper is focused on probabilistic methods for sampling from multimodal distributions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
