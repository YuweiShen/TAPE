The paper also presents an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for fitting the parameters of a mixture of factor analyzers. Both of these techniques fall under the category of probabilistic methods, which involve modeling uncertainty and probability distributions in data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
