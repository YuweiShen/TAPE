The case-based reasoning module is designed as an addition to a traditional reactive control system.\n- Reinforcement Learning: The paper discusses the implementation and evaluation of the method in the ACBARR system through empirical simulation of the system on several different environments, which is a common approach in reinforcement learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
