The output of the model is the position size between a risky and a risk-free asset. The iterative parameter update rules are derived and compared to alternative approaches.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper discusses a trading strategy that is evaluated and analyzed on both computer-generated data and real-world data. The goal is to optimize out-of-sample risk-adjusted profit, which can be achieved with this nonlinear approach. This involves learning from experience and adjusting the strategy based on the feedback received."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
