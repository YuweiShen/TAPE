The paper also discusses local learning algorithms that can be derived for belief networks, which operate using only information that is directly available from the normal, inferential processes of the networks.\n\nNeural Networks: The paper discusses neural networks, which represent parameterized algebraic combinations of nonlinear activation functions and have found widespread use as models of real neural systems and as function approximators because of their amenability to simple training algorithms. The paper also discusses local learning algorithms that can be derived for belief networks, which have a certain biological plausibility and allow for a massively parallel implementation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
