The approach is based on a genetic algorithm that uses a population of candidate solutions and iteratively applies selection, crossover, and mutation operators to generate new solutions. The authors also discuss the implementation details of the genetic algorithm, such as the encoding of solutions, the fitness function, and the parameters of the algorithm.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the proposed evolutionary heuristic approach. The authors prove that the algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution that is at most twice the size of the optimal solution with a high probability. They also provide experimental results that show the effectiveness of the approach on benchmark instances of the Minimum Vertex Cover Problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
