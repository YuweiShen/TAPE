The resulting models have multiple state variables that are temporally coupled via matrices of conditional probabilities. The paper also introduces a deterministic O(T (CN ) 2 ) approximation for maximum a posterior (MAP) state estimation which enables fast classification and parameter estimation via expectation maximization. The paper compares these algorithms on synthetic and real data, including interpretation of video. All of these methods and experiments involve probabilistic modeling and inference."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
