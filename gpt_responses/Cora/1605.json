This is a key aspect of reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to take actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal.\n\nRule Learning is also present in the text as the paper proposes a practical approach to learning from the environment by pinpointing faults in the domain knowledge that cause unexpected behavior and resorting to experimentation to correct the system's knowledge. This approach involves learning rules about the environment and updating them incrementally based on new information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
