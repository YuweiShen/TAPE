The authors explain how they modified the LBG algorithm to incorporate the self-organizing map concept, resulting in the LBG-U method. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper discusses the use of probability distributions in the LBG-U method, specifically the Gaussian mixture model. The authors explain how the LBG-U method uses the Gaussian mixture model to model the probability distribution of the input data, which is then used to generate the codebook."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
