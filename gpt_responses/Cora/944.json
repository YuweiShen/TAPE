The Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) classifier introduced in the paper is based on Bayesian networks and the extension proposed in the paper also uses parametric and semiparametric conditional probabilities. The paper also discusses the advantages of using the modeling language of Bayesian networks to represent both discrete and continuous attributes simultaneously."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
