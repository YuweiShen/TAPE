Genetic algorithms are a type of evolutionary algorithm that use principles of natural selection and genetics to optimize solutions to problems. The paper provides a biological background on non-coding DNA and introns to better understand and conduct research using EAs. Therefore, genetic algorithms are the most related sub-category of AI to this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
