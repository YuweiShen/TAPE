The focus is on using neural networks to identify the class of predefined models whose characteristics match the ones of the specified PDE based application. While other sub-categories of AI may also be relevant to the overall PYTHIA system, this paper primarily focuses on the use of neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
