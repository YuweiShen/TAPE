The search for hypotheses is done by the standard AQ inductive rule learning algorithm. The paper also discusses the need for M-of-N rules and how they are detected by observing \"exclusive-or\" or \"equivalence\" patterns in the hypotheses. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI called Rule Learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
