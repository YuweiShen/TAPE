Each expert is trained independently and adjusts its receptive field and bias using second order methods. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The experts cooperate by blending their individual predictions when a query is required. Each expert is trained by minimizing a penalized local cross validation error. The paper also derives asymptotic results for the method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
