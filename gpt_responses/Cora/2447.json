It proposes an alternative approach that partially integrates machine learning into a modeling system called n-dim. The use of machine learning in n-dim is presented, and open research issues are outlined. This approach involves probabilistic methods that can handle uncertainty and multiple sources of information."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
