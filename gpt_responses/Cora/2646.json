They explain how the algorithm works and how it is used to optimize the fitness function.\n\nReinforcement Learning is also present in the paper as the authors use a reinforcement learning approach to train the fitness raters. They explain how the system is trained using a reward-based approach and how the fitness raters are evaluated based on their ability to predict the user's preferences."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
