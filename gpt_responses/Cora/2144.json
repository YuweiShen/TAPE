These formulas are based on probabilistic methods and provide the tightest bounds on the average treatment effect that can be inferred given the distribution of assignments, treatments, and responses. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Probabilistic Methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
