The authors use a variational approach to approximate the posterior distribution over the latent function values, which allows for efficient inference and prediction. The paper also discusses the use of different covariance functions and hyperparameters to model the data. Overall, the paper focuses on probabilistic modeling and inference, making it most closely related to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
