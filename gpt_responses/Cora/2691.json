The authors then use a novel two-phase algorithm to merge clusters of related proteins based on transitivity and strong connectivity, and refine the classification based on a global test. The resulting hierarchical organization of all proteins is obtained at varying thresholds of statistical significance. Therefore, probabilistic methods are used throughout the paper to analyze and classify the space of all protein sequences."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
