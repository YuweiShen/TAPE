The focus of the paper is on the effects of using multiple node types within the DMP framework, which is a specific type of neural network. The simulation results show that DMP2 performs favorably in comparison with other learning algorithms, which are also likely to be neural network-based."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
