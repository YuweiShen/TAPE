The model is a Memory-Based Model (MBM) that contains sparse population coding, memory-based recognition, and codebooks of prototypes. The units of MBMs are consistent with the usual description of cortical neurons as tuned to multidimensional optimal stimuli. The paper describes how an example of MBM may be realized in terms of cortical circuitry and biophysical mechanisms, consistent with psychophysical and physiological data. The paper also makes a number of predictions, testable with physiological techniques."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
