Simulated annealing is a probabilistic method that uses a probability distribution to guide the search for a solution. \n\nTheory: The paper presents an ablation study that helps to explain the relative advantage of SASAT over GSAT. The study involves systematically removing components of the SASAT algorithm to determine their contribution to its performance. This is a theoretical analysis of the algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
