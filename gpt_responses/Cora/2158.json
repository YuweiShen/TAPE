The method presented, iterative bootstrap induction, is a rule learning technique that generates simple clauses as properties of the required definition and uses them to induce the required recursive definitions. The experiments conducted in the paper also evaluate the effectiveness of the rule learning approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
