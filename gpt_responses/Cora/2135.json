This involves probabilistic modeling of the relationship between the input features and the output function. Additionally, the algorithm involves constructing new features based on the joint ability of existing features to predict the error of the current hypothesis, which can be seen as a probabilistic approach to feature selection.\n\nRule Learning: The algorithm presented in the paper involves constructing new features by forming the product of the two features that most effectively predict the squared error of the current hypothesis. This can be seen as a rule-based approach to feature construction, where the rule is to combine the two most effective features. Additionally, the extension to the method involves selecting the specific pair of features to combine based on their joint ability to predict the hypothesis' error, which can be seen as a rule-based approach to feature selection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
