The experiments conducted in the paper show that the proposed mechanism, Stepwise Adaptation of Weights (SAW), substantially increases GA performance. The paper also compares the SAW-ing GA with the best heuristic technique, WGSAT, and concludes that the GA is superior. Therefore, the paper primarily belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Genetic Algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
