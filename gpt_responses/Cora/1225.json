The paper discusses the limitations of classic genetic operators and proposes the use of high-level genetic operators to overcome these limitations.\n\nRule Learning: The paper specifically focuses on learning a rule base to adapt the parameters of an image processing operator path. The approach described in the paper involves integrating task-specific but domain-independent knowledge to guide the use of genetic operators. This knowledge is used to define rules that govern the use of the genetic operators."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
