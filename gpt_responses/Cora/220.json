The authors formulate the problems of learning to sort a vector of numbers and learning decision trees from data as POMDPs.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper uses a general POMDP algorithm to solve the formulated problems. The authors mention the advantage of the POMDP approach in producing principled solutions that integrate physical and information gathering actions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
