The Xilinx XC6216 field-programmable gate array is used as a platform for implementing and testing the evolved networks. While other sub-categories of AI may also be relevant to this work (such as neural networks for classification tasks), the focus of the paper is on the use of genetic programming and evolutionary algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
