The paper presents a suite of six standard test functions to GA and VFSR codes from previous studies, without any additional fine tuning, to compare their efficiency. \n\nProbabilistic Methods are also present in the paper as both GA and VFSR are stochastic optimization algorithms that use probabilistic methods to search for the optimal solution. VFSR is statistically guaranteed to find the function optima, which is a probabilistic property."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
