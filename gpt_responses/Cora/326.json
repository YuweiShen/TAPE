The algorithms combine tree-clustering with conditioning to trade space for time, and the selection of the algorithm that best meets a given time-space specification is based on analyzing the problem structure. Therefore, the paper is primarily focused on probabilistic methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
