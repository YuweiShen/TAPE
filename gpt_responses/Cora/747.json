The network has feedforward and feedback connections, and during learning, sensory stimuli and desired response are simultaneously presented as input. Feedforward connections form self-organized representations of input, while suppressed feedback connections learn the transpose of feedforward connectivity. During recall, sensory input activates the self-organized representation, and activity generates the learned response.\n\nRule Learning: The paper proposes a mechanism for selective suppression of transmission at feedback synapses during learning, which allows for combining associative feedback with self-organization of feedforward synapses. The network uses local rules to learn mappings which are not linearly separable. During learning, sensory stimuli and desired response are simultaneously presented as input, and feedforward connections form self-organized representations of input, while suppressed feedback connections learn the transpose of feedforward connectivity. During recall, suppression is removed, and activity generates the learned response."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
