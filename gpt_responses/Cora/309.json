It describes a new genetic algorithm, the merged genetic algorithm, and proves its efficiency for the class of monotonic functions. The analysis pertains to the ideal behavior of the algorithm, showing convergence of probability distributions over the search space of combinatorial structures to the optimal one. The paper concludes with a discussion of some immediate problems that lie ahead for genetic algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
