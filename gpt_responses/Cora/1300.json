The paper specifically focuses on the characteristic scale of weight changes and how it can be matched to the residuals, allowing structural properties such as a node's fan-in and fan-out to affect the local learning rate and backpropagated error. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Neural Networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
