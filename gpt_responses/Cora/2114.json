The associated likelihood function is also discussed, and an EM algorithm is presented for estimating the principal subspace iteratively. The paper emphasizes the advantages of defining a probability density function for PCA. All of these aspects are related to probabilistic methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
