It compares the approach to traditional symbolic learning algorithms and highlights the advantage of neural networks in forming concept representations. \n\nRule Learning: The paper specifically focuses on the extraction of symbolic rules from trained neural networks using the NofM extraction algorithm and soft weight-sharing training method. It compares the extracted rules to those learned using the C4.5 system and evaluates their accuracy and comprehensibility."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
