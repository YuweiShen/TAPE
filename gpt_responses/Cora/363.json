The oscillators whose frequencies match periodicities in the input tend to become activated, which is a characteristic of neural networks.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for representing rhythmic patterns in a network of oscillators. It discusses the importance of metrical structure in the perception and production of patterns in time and describes how the network represents rests in rhythmic patterns. The paper also makes predictions about the relative difficulty of patterns and the effect of deviations from periodicity in the input."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
