The Bayesian approach also helps detect poor underlying assumptions in learning models and penalizes over-flexible and over-complex models, embodying Occam's razor. The paper explicitly refers to the Bayesian framework for regularization and model comparison described in a companion paper by MacKay (1991a) and due to Gull and Skilling (Gull, 1989a)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
