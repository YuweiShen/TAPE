The algorithm actively explores the environment to learn an accurate model of the system faster and produces a control law that is close to optimal. \n\nTheory is also relevant as the authors analyze the algorithm in a PAC learning framework and show that the time taken by the algorithm is polynomial in the dimension of the state-space and action-space."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
