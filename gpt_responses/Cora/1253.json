The paper describes how SAMUEL uses a genetic algorithm to automate the process of creating stimulus-response rules and reduce the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. \n\nRule Learning is also present in the text as SAMUEL learns reactive behaviors in the form of stimulus-response rules. The paper describes how SAMUEL learns these behaviors under simulation, and how the learning algorithm was designed to learn useful behaviors from simulations of limited fidelity. The paper also describes specific behaviors that have been learned for simulated autonomous aircraft, autonomous underwater vehicles, and robots, including dog fighting, missile evasion, tracking, navigation, and obstacle avoidance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
