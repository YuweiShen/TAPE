This method involves computing principal components in high-dimensional feature spaces related to input space by some nonlinear map. The paper also presents experimental results on polynomial feature extraction for pattern recognition.\n\nNeural Networks: The method proposed in the paper involves computing principal components in high-dimensional feature spaces related to input space by some nonlinear map. This is similar to the concept of neural networks, where input data is transformed through nonlinear activation functions to produce output. Additionally, the paper mentions using the method for pattern recognition, which is a common application of neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
