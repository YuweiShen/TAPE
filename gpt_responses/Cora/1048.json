This system is based on neural networks, as it uses a representational format with a temporal structure to relate components of a single complex movement.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper mentions that OXBOW is an unsupervised learning system, which means that it uses probabilistic methods to learn from the data. The system builds abstract movement concepts with appropriate component structure, allowing it to predict the latter portions of a partially observed movement. This prediction is based on the probability of the observed movement belonging to a certain class."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
