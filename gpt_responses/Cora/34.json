It also talks about how the system can identify when a similar task has been solved previously and retrieve the relevant surface, resulting in a faster learning rate.\n\nAdditionally, the paper also belongs to the sub-category of Case Based as it demonstrates the use of a case base of surfaces to speed up reinforcement learning. The system indexes into this case base to retrieve relevant surfaces for similar tasks, which is a key feature of case-based reasoning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
