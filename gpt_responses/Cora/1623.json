The model is a simple recurrent neural network that was trained on daily closing prices of ten market indices over a period of five years. The paper demonstrates that the model has significant predictive power and can be used to time transactions in the gold bullion and gold mining company stock index markets to obtain a significant paper profit. The paper does not mention any other sub-categories of AI such as Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Probabilistic Methods, Reinforcement Learning, Rule Learning, or Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
