The authors also implement a reversible jump MCMC sampler for model determination, which is a probabilistic method. The paper discusses the use of prior distributions and characterizes the set of moves which preserve the decomposability of the graph, both of which are common in probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
