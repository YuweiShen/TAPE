They connect both simulated and real robots to a learning classifier system with an extended genetic algorithm. \n\nGenetic algorithms are also present in the paper, as the authors use a parallel implementation of a learning classifier system with an extended genetic algorithm to classify different kinds of Animat-like behaviors. They also show that classifier systems with genetic algorithms can be practically employed to develop autonomous agents."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
