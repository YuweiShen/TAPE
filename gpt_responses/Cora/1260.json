This is a form of rule learning, where the learned filters can be seen as rules for filtering documents. The paper also proposes a variation on a feature selection method that has been widely used in text categorization, which can be seen as a rule-based approach to feature selection."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
