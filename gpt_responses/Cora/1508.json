The authors propose using nonlinear gated experts with simulated annealing to perform the segmentation and system identification of the time series. Simulated annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm that is used to find the global minimum of a function.\n\nNeural Networks: The paper proposes using nonlinear gated experts to perform the segmentation and system identification of the time series. Nonlinear gated experts are a type of neural network that consists of multiple experts, each of which is responsible for modeling a different part of the input space. The gating network decides which expert to use for a given input."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
