The objective is to investigate the performance of GAs on Kauffman's NK-landscapes with varying extents of sexuality used for reproduction. The paper presents results that confirm the superiority of sexual recombination on mildly epistatic problems. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Genetic Algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
