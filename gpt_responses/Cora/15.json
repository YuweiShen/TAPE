Back-propagation is a commonly used algorithm for training neural networks. The paper specifically focuses on the sensitivity of back propagation to initial weight configuration. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Neural Networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
