The authors describe how the system retrieves relevant cases, adapts them to the current problem, and uses them to generate plans.\n\nPlanning: The paper focuses on the development of a partial-order planner, which is a type of AI system that generates plans by breaking them down into smaller subgoals and then ordering those subgoals based on their dependencies. The authors describe how their case-based planning framework is integrated with the partial-order planner to improve its performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
