The motivation for using a multi-layer network is to improve the performance and robustness of separation, while applying a very simple local learning rule, which is biologically plausible. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper uses a probabilistic approach for blind separation of highly correlated human faces from a mixture of them, with additive noise and under an unknown number of sources. The proposed neural network architecture enables the extraction of source signals sequentially one after the other, starting from the strongest signal and finishing with the weakest one."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
