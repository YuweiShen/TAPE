The tool is based on a block oriented approach with a transparent description of signal paths. The paper also provides a short survey on other techniques for computer-based system identification, but the main focus is on the genetic programming approach used in the SMOG system. Therefore, the paper is most related to the Genetic Algorithms sub-category of AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
