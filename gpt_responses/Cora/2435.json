It derives a large class of robustly convergent identification algorithms and provides explicit worst case error bounds. While some of the algorithms may involve probabilistic methods or neural networks, the main focus of the paper is on the theoretical foundations of the problem and the development of rigorous mathematical techniques for solving it. Therefore, the paper belongs primarily to the sub-category of Theory in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
