The study assesses the effectiveness of this approach on different types of challenging problems, using previously developed measures of `diversity' for such systems. The paper shows that the automatic decomposition produces an effective set of specialist networks that can support a high level of performance. All of these aspects are related to neural networks, which are a sub-category of AI that involves the use of interconnected nodes to process information and learn from data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
