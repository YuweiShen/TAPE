The players learn from their past experiences and adjust their strategies accordingly. \n\nTheory is also present in the paper as it examines the social network methods used to identify population behaviors found within the complex adaptive system of IPD/CR. The paper analyzes the social networks of interesting populations and their evolution, which is a theoretical approach to understanding the behavior of the system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
