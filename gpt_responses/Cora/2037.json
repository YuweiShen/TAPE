It also explores issues related to similarity measures and the cases in the case-base. \n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Theory because it presents a formalization of the knowledge content of case memory systems, which is a necessary preliminary to more rigorous analysis of the performance of case-based reasoning systems. It also discusses the generalization of recent formalizations of case-based classification within a framework of case-base semantics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
