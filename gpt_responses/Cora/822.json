The extensions include a different learning algorithm, a wider input \"window\", error-correcting output coding, a right-to-left scan of the word to be pronounced (with the results of each decision influencing subsequent decisions), and the addition of several useful input features. These changes yielded a system that performs much better than the original NETtalk system. The paper does not mention any other sub-categories of AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
