The paper proposes a strategy for understanding the types of fitness landscapes that lead to successful GA performance, and presents experimental results on the role of crossover and building blocks on these landscapes. \n\nTheory is also a relevant sub-category, as the paper aims to provide a theoretical basis for characterizing fitness landscapes and understanding GA performance. The authors propose a set of features of fitness landscapes that are relevant to the GA, and experimentally study how different configurations of these features affect GA performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
