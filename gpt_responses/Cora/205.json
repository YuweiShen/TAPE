Specifically, the authors propose a neural network model that incorporates both place cells and grid cells, which are known to play a key role in spatial navigation in rodents. The model is used to simulate various navigation tasks and to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying these tasks.\n\nTheory: The paper also contributes to the development of a computational neuroscience theory of rodent navigation. The authors propose a theoretical framework that integrates various aspects of rodent navigation, including the role of place cells, grid cells, and other neural mechanisms. The paper discusses how this framework can be used to explain various experimental findings and to make predictions about the neural mechanisms underlying navigation in rodents."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
