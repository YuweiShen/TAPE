The paper discusses the problem of integrating planning with real-time learning and decision-making, which is a key problem in reinforcement learning. The paper also proposes a solution to this problem based on the mathematical framework of Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning.\n\nTheory is another sub-category of AI that this paper belongs to. The paper presents a theoretical framework for multi-time models and establishes their suitability for planning and learning by virtue of their relationship to the Bellman equations. The paper also summarizes prior work on temporally abstract models and extends it from the prediction setting to include actions, control, and planning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
