The paper also discusses the use of weight perturbations (Wagging), which is a probabilistic method. \n\nRule Learning is present in the paper through the use of a decision tree inducer and the comparison of different variants of the algorithm. The paper also measures tree sizes and shows a correlation between the increase in tree size and the success in reducing error."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
