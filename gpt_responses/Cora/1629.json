The algorithm is designed to be stable in terms of applicability in different geographical regions, and the paper compares its applicability in two different test sites. The use of calibrated radar signatures suggests a probabilistic approach to classification, where the algorithm assigns probabilities to different classes based on the measured radar signatures.
