The discretization technique is a method for handling numerical attributes in relational learning problems, which is a common task in ILP. The lookahead technique is a method for assessing the quality of a refinement without knowing which refinements will be enabled afterwards, which is a theoretical problem in ILP. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-categories of Rule Learning and Theory in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
