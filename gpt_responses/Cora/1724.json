The competition is adiabatically increased during training to obtain maximal specialization. The method achieves almost perfect identification and segmentation in the case of switching chaotic dynamics where input manifolds overlap and input-output relations are ambiguous. Applications to time series from complex systems demonstrate the potential relevance of the approach for time series analysis and short-term prediction."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
