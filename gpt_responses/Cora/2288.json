The authors discuss the use of probability distributions and conditional probabilities in constructing AIDs, as well as the use of inference algorithms such as variable elimination and message passing.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for AIDs, including a formal definition and properties such as soundness and completeness. The authors also discuss the relationship between AIDs and other decision-making frameworks such as decision trees and Markov decision processes."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
