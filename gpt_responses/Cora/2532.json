The paper then introduces ensemble learning, which approximates the entire posterior probability distribution over the parameters. The objective function that is optimized is a variational free energy, which measures the relative entropy between the approximating ensemble and the true distribution. Therefore, the paper primarily focuses on probabilistic methods for training Hidden Markov Models."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
