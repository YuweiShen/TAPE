These models are based on the concept of neural networks, which are a type of AI that is modeled after the structure and function of the human brain.\n\nTheory: The paper discusses the development of a new ASOCS model called DNA, which does not depend on a hierarchical node structure for success. The paper also discusses three areas of the DNA model, including its flexible nodes, how it overcomes problems with allocating unused nodes, and how it operates during processing and learning. These discussions are all related to the theoretical development of the DNA model."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
