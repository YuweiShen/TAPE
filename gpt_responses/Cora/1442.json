The d-rules are first order and are learned through a \"generalize-and-test\" approach. \n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Theory because it discusses the pedagogic technique of teaching problem-solving through exercises and how this approach can be applied to acquire search-control knowledge in the form of d-rules. The paper presents a theoretical framework for learning d-rules and demonstrates its feasibility through application in two planning domains."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
