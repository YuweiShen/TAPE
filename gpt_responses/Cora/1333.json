The GA concept learner (GABL) is implemented and compared to an incremental concept learner, ID5R. \n\nRule Learning is also relevant, as the GABL is a rule-based learner that learns a concept from a set of positive and negative examples. The authors note that GABL is effective and competitive with ID5R as the target concept increases in complexity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
