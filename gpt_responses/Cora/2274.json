The study analyzes the emergence of generalist and specialist behaviors in these populations.\n\nGenetic Algorithms: The paper discusses the use of evolvable fitness formulae, which allow the evaluation measure to evolve along with the expressed behavior. This leads to co-evolution of the individual and the fitness formula. This is a key feature of genetic algorithms, where the fitness function is allowed to evolve over time."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
