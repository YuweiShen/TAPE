This involves probabilistic methods for estimating models from sensor data.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a formalization of decompositional, model-based learning (DML), which is a method developed by observing a modeler's expertise at decomposing large scale model estimation tasks. The paper also discusses the analogy between learning and consistency-based diagnosis, which is a theoretical concept."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
