The fitness function of the genetic algorithm is the average cost of classification when using the decision tree, including both the costs of tests (features, measurements) and the costs of classification errors.\n\nRule Learning: ICET is a hybrid genetic decision tree induction algorithm that evolves a population of biases for decision tree induction. The biases are used to guide the search for decision trees that minimize the cost of classification. The paper compares ICET with three other algorithms for cost-sensitive classification (EG2, CS-ID3, and IDX) and with C4.5, which classifies without regard to cost. The evaluation is based on five real-world medical datasets, and the performance of the algorithms is measured in terms of their ability to minimize the cost of classification."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
