The approach involves explicitly representing and learning the local structure in the conditional probability distributions (CPDs) that quantify these networks, which is a probabilistic method. The paper also evaluates the proposed learning procedure empirically, which is a common practice in probabilistic methods research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
