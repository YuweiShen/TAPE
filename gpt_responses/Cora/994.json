The paper also belongs to the sub-category of Rule Learning because it proposes an efficient solution to the problem of showing that the recommendations and appropriateness conditions of a story obtain in a new situation, which involves learning rules from past cases. Specifically, the proposal involves caching the results of determining the story's recommendations and appropriateness conditions, which can be seen as a form of rule learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
