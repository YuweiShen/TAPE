The reinforcement learning component refines the content of the cases based on the current experience. \n\nCase-based reasoning is also present in the paper as the case-based reasoning component perceives and characterizes the system's environment, retrieves an appropriate case, and uses the recommendations of the case to tune the parameters of the reactive control system. The learning components perform on-line adaptation, resulting in improved performance as the reactive control system tunes itself to the environment, as well as on-line case learning, resulting in an improved library of cases that capture environmental regularities necessary to perform on-line adaptation."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
