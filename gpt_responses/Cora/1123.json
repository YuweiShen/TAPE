The model uses a pool of memory items and a matcher to filter candidates, which is similar to how a case-based reasoning system works.\n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods because the model uses content vectors to estimate how well structured representations will match, which is a probabilistic approach. Additionally, the paper mentions that the model is capable of modeling patterns of access found in psychological data, which suggests that it uses probabilistic methods to make predictions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
