This is a probabilistic approach that aims to find the most likely set of variables that explain the survival data. The method is a variation of the \"lasso\" proposal of Tibshirani (1994), which is also a probabilistic method designed for linear regression. The simulations in the paper compare the accuracy of the lasso method with stepwise selection, which is another probabilistic method commonly used in Cox regression."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
