The paper also presents new asymptotic convergence results paralleling the laws of large numbers in probability theory.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a framework for describing a sequence of random outcomes as being drawn from a convex set of distributions, rather than just from a single distribution. The paper also compares this approach with approaches based on prior subjective constraints, which is a theoretical comparison."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
