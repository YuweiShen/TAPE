The paper explores the use of stochastic policies in the search space and defines the value or utility of a distribution over states. \n\nFinally, the paper also falls under the category of Theory, as it presents new frameworks and results for learning in POMDPs without resorting to state estimation. It challenges the conventional discounted RL framework and proposes a new approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
