The modification made to the bagging procedure involves using randomly-generated decision stumps, which are a type of decision tree with a depth of one. This modification is aimed at increasing the diversity of the decision trees used in the ensemble. The paper also discusses the theoretical hypothesis that boosting produces more diverse trees than bagging, and the empirical findings that support this hypothesis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
