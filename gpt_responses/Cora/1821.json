The learning rules use simple constrained Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning, which is a common technique in neural network learning. The paper also introduces a novel computationally efficient fixed-point algorithm to speed up the convergence of the stochastic gradient descent rules. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
