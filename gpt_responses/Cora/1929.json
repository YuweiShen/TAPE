The authors analyze the geometry of the early stopping process and provide insights into the behavior of the network during training.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the early stopping technique in linear networks. The authors derive mathematical expressions for the optimal stopping point and the generalization error of the network. They also provide geometric interpretations of the early stopping process and its relationship to the network's weight space."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
