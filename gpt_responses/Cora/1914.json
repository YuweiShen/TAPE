It also analyzes sigmoidal multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks that employ the back-prop learning algorithm. \n\nTheory: The paper develops a theoretical framework consisting of a measure of interference and a measure of network localization, which incorporates not only the network weights and architecture but also the learning algorithm. It also addresses a familiar misconception about sigmoidal networks and demonstrates that they can be made arbitrarily local while retaining the ability to represent any continuous function on a compact domain."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
