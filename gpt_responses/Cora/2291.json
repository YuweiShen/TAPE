The proposed method is a top-down approach to searching for good theories, which can be seen as a form of rule learning. \n- Theory: The paper introduces a new method for improving the efficiency of pruning algorithms in relational learning, which involves searching for good theories in a top-down fashion. This can be seen as a theoretical contribution to the field."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
