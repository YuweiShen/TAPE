This is a key characteristic of case-based reasoning, which is a subfield of AI that involves solving new problems by adapting solutions from similar past cases. The paper describes how the structure of a case can be represented using a graph-based model, and how this model can be used to guide the retrieval of similar cases. Overall, the paper is focused on the use of past cases to inform problem-solving, which is a core aspect of case-based reasoning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
