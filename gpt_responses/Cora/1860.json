The paper proposes a new algorithm for making fast predictions with arbitrary local weighting functions, arbitrary kernel widths, and arbitrary queries. The paper also discusses an approximation that achieves up to a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup with negligible accuracy losses. These are all characteristics of Case Based AI, which involves solving new problems by adapting solutions to similar past problems.\n\nThis paper also belongs to the sub-category of Theory because it discusses the drawbacks of previous approaches to dealing with the computational expense of LWPR predictions and proposes a new algorithm based on a multiresolution search of a quickly-constructible augmented kd-tree. The paper also discusses potential extensions for tractable instance-based learning on datasets that are too large to fit in a computer's main memory. These are all characteristics of Theory in AI, which involves developing new algorithms and models for solving problems."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
