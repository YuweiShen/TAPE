The paper describes how a genetic algorithm is used to search the space of all possible subsets of a large set of candidate discrimination features. \n\nRule learning is also present in this paper, as the C4.5 decision-tree learning algorithm is used to evaluate candidate feature subsets and produce a decision tree based on the given features using a limited amount of training data. The resulting decision tree is then used to classify unseen testing data, and the classification performance is used as the fitness of the underlying feature subset."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
