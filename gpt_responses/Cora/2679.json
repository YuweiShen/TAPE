The primary goal is to understand patterns of variability over time in hospital-level and monitor area-specific quality monitor measures, and patterns of dependencies between sets of monitors. The paper discusses the development of several classes of formal models, including hierarchical random effects time series models, which are probabilistic methods used to model single or multiple monitor time series. The paper presents results of analyses of the three monitor data sets, in both single and multiple monitor frameworks, and presents a variety of summary inferences in graphical displays. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
