The proposed method results in a tree-structured hybrid architecture that uses component neural networks at the leaves of the tree to deal with subtasks. The growing and credit-assignment algorithms developed for the hybrid architecture provide an efficient way to apply existing neural networks for solving a large scale problem. The paper evaluates the performance of the proposed method on several benchmark classification problems and compares it with the multi-layered perceptron. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
