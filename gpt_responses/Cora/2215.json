The first technique involves combining EBL with inductive learning techniques to learn a better set of control rules, while the second technique involves using inductive techniques to learn approximate control rules. These techniques are synthesized in an algorithm called approximating abductive explanation based learning (AxA-EBL). The paper focuses on the theoretical aspects of these techniques and their application in several domains. Therefore, the paper belongs to the sub-categories of Rule Learning and Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
