The paper also provides exact and asymptotic Bayesian results for testing hypotheses of independence and dependence, which are probabilistic methods for making statistical inferences. The use of mutual information as a measure of dependence is also a probabilistic method, as it involves calculating the amount of information shared between two random variables."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
