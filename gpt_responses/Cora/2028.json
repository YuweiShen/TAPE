The paper also describes teacher/learner pairs for the classes of 1-decision lists and Horn sentences. \n\nTheory is present in the text as the paper presents general results relating this model of teaching to various previous results and proves that any class that can be exactly identified by a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm with access to a very rich set of example-based queries is teachable by a computationally unbounded teacher and a polynomial-time learner."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
