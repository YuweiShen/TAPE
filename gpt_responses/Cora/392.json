CWM is a mixture model that assigns each data point to one of several clusters, each with its own probability distribution. The paper discusses the use of Bayesian inference to estimate the model parameters and make predictions.\n\nNeural Networks: The paper also discusses the use of neural networks as a component of the CWM approach. Specifically, the authors propose using a neural network to model the conditional probability distribution of each cluster given the input data. The neural network is trained using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent. The paper provides experimental results comparing the performance of CWM with and without the neural network component."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
