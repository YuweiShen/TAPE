Reinforcement Learning is present in the paper as the authors propose a reinforcement learning-based approach to estimate shortest paths in dynamic graphs. They use Q-learning, a popular reinforcement learning algorithm, to learn the optimal policy for packet routing in dynamic graphs. Probabilistic Methods are also present in the paper as the authors use a probabilistic model to estimate the probability of link failures in the network. They use this information to update the Q-values in the reinforcement learning algorithm."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
