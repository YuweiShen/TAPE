The process of calibration involves setting free parameters to optimize the predictive accuracy of the model, which can be seen as a probabilistic approach to learning.\n\nRule Learning: The paper describes a divide-and-conquer approach to calibrating the model, in which subsets of the parameters were calibrated while others were held constant. This approach was made possible by carefully selecting training sets that exercised only portions of the model and by designing error functions for each part that had desirable properties. This can be seen as a form of rule learning, where the rules are based on the structure of the model and the constraints introduced by the prior knowledge."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
