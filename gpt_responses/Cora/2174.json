The experiments conducted involve providing guidance to an autonomous robot using reinforcement learning techniques. While other sub-categories of AI may also be relevant to the development of autonomous agents, the focus of this paper is on reinforcement learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
