ILP is a subfield of Rule Learning, which involves learning rules from examples. The paper also discusses the problem of learning classification rules from a database of peak patterns for diterpenes with known structure, which is a theoretical problem in the field of AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
