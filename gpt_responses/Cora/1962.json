The learning problems suggested by this model also use the definitions and models of distribution learning defined in [6], which are probabilistic in nature.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a framework that is general enough to model previously studied distribution learning problems, as well as to suggest new applications. It also investigates the relative difficulty of special cases of the general problem and presents algorithms to solve the learning problem under various conditions. These aspects of the paper are related to the theoretical aspects of AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
