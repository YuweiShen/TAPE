This paper belongs to the sub-category of Reinforcement Learning as it discusses the use of reinforcement learning systems with parameterized function approximators such as neural networks to generalize between similar situations and actions. The paper presents positive results for control tasks using sparse-coarse-coded function approximators and online learning. The paper also discusses the limitations of using actual outcomes (\"rollouts\") and suggests that reinforcement learning can work robustly in conjunction with function approximators."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
