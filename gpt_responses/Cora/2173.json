The paper also discusses how the genetic algorithm balances evolutionary design and human expertise to best design these agents. While other sub-categories of AI may be involved in the implementation of the agents, the focus of the paper is on the use of genetic algorithms in the design process."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
