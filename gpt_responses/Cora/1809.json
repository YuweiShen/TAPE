LINNEO + is a knowledge acquisition tool that automatically generates classes from examples using an unsupervised strategy, while GAR is used to generate a set of classification rules for the original training set. The paper presents an application of these techniques to data obtained from a real wastewater treatment plant in order to help the construction of a rule base. Therefore, the paper primarily focuses on the process of learning rules from data, making it a Rule Learning sub-category of AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
