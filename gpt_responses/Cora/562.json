The paper presents a new learning algorithm and a modular architecture that achieves transfer of learning by sharing the solutions of elemental SDTs across multiple composite SDTs. The straightforward application of reinforcement learning to multiple tasks is also discussed. Therefore, reinforcement learning is the most related sub-category of AI in this paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
