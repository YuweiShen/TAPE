The algorithm is used to learn the evaluation function of a chess program while playing on the Free Internet Chess Server (FICS). The success of the program is attributed to the use of TDLeaf() and reinforcement learning. \n- Theory: The paper discusses the relationship between the results obtained by KnightCap and Tesauro's results in backgammon. It also presents some experiments and discusses the reasons for the success of the program."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
