The authors describe the architecture of the proposed Vector Associative Map (VAM) and how it can be used to learn and control movement trajectories.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper discusses how the VAM can be trained using reinforcement learning techniques. The authors describe how the VAM can be used to learn from error signals and adjust movement trajectories accordingly. They also discuss how the VAM can be used to learn from positive and negative feedback to improve performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
