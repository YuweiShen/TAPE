The simulations described in the paper also involve neural network models.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical perspective on human consciousness and its relationship to cognitive information processing. It proposes that the contents of consciousness correspond to temporally persistent states in a network of computational modules, and explores the idea that periodic settling to persistent states improves performance. The paper also integrates existing theoretical perspectives on consciousness."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
