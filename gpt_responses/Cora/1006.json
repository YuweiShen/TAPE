The learning algorithm is motivated by real applications in man-machine interaction such as handwriting and speech recognition. The paper also discusses the theoretical properties of the algorithm, including its ability to efficiently learn distributions generated by the restricted sources. Therefore, the paper primarily belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
