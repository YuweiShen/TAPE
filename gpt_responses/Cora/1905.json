The experiments conducted aim to determine the most successful strategies and to see how and when these strategies evolve depending on the context and negotiation stance of the agent's opponent. Therefore, the paper primarily belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Genetic Algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
