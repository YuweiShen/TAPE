The paper discusses the use of information-theoretic metrics to efficiently select a subset of attributes from which to learn the classifier, which is a common approach in probabilistic methods. The paper also compares the proposed method with existing selective Bayesian network induction approaches, which are also probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
