The paper also discusses the use of a sequential estimator of the density of the target distribution, which is another probabilistic method. The focus of the paper is on the asymptotic properties of the algorithm, which is a theoretical aspect of probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
