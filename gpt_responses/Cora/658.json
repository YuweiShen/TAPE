The random generation of n-bit vectors and the selection of the best solutions within the neighborhood are similar to the concepts of crossover and selection in genetic algorithms.\n\nNeural Networks: The paper introduces the concept of Hebbian learning rule, which is a well-known concept in the theory of artificial neural networks. The probability vector is updated using this rule, which is a form of unsupervised learning.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The main concept of the proposed method is the probability vector, which determines the probabilities of appearance of '1' entries in n-bit vectors. This vector is used for the random generation of n-bit vectors that form a neighborhood. The process is repeated until the probability vector entries are close either to zero or to one, which determines the optimal solution. This approach is based on probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
