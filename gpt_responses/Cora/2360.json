The paper also discusses combinatorial results for randomly labeled automata and shows that the labeling of the states and the bits of the input sequence need not be truly random, but merely semi-random.\n\nTheory: The paper presents new and efficient algorithms for learning deterministic finite automata in an entirely passive learning model. The paper also proves a number of combinatorial results for randomly labeled automata and discusses an extension of the results to a model in which automata are used to represent distributions over binary strings."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
