This approach is based on past performance of learners in that region, which can be seen as a form of case-based reasoning.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper mentions \"dynamic weighting\" of learners based on their regional accuracy, which can be seen as a form of reinforcement learning where the weights are updated based on the performance of the learners.\n\nRule Learning: The paper mentions the use of a rule learner, CN2, as one of the constituent learners in the meta-learning strategies being compared. This indicates the presence of rule learning in the paper."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
