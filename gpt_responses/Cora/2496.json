The authors describe a grammar and parser for eukaryotic protein-encoding genes, which is optimized for several different species. \n\nIt also belongs to the sub-category of Theory because it presents a theoretical framework for gene structure prediction based on linguistic methods. The authors discuss the relative importance of compositional, signal-based, and syntactic components in gene prediction, and perform mixing experiments to determine the degree of species specificity."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
