The authors consider the process of drawing a classifier at random for each example and using it on all examples, and they discuss how to estimate the expected test error rate and variance in each case. These methods rely on probabilistic models and assumptions about the distribution of errors and classifiers, making this paper most closely related to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
