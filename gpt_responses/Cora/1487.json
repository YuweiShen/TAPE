This is a form of probabilistic modeling, where the goal is to optimize the accuracy of the model for making future predictions.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a new divide-and-conquer method for solving the model calibration task, which involves analyzing the model to identify a series of smaller optimization problems whose sequential solution solves the global calibration problem. This approach is based on theoretical principles of efficient learning from prior knowledge, and the paper argues that such methods will be required for agents with large amounts of prior knowledge to learn efficiently."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
