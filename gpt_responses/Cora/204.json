It explains how these networks can be trained to recognize patterns in language data and make predictions based on those patterns. The paper also discusses the advantages and limitations of using neural networks for natural language processing. Therefore, the paper is primarily focused on the use of neural networks in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
