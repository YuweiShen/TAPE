This paper discusses the use of probabilistic finite state automata (PFSAs) for modelling behavioural data, and evaluates possible hypotheses using the Minimum Message Length (MML) measure. The paper also discusses the use of Fogel's Evolutionary Programming for producing globally optimal PFSA models. While Genetic Algorithms are mentioned briefly, they are not the focus of the paper. The other sub-categories of AI (Case Based, Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Rule Learning, Theory) are not mentioned in the text."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
