This is a key aspect of reinforcement learning, where the agent learns to take actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. \n\nRule learning is present in the text as the paper proposes a learning method that can compile sensorimotor experiences into continuous operators, which can then be used to improve performance of the problem solver. This can be seen as a form of rule learning, where the system learns to map input sensory information to appropriate control outputs based on past experiences."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
