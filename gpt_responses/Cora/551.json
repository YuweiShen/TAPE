The paper proposes a method called utilization filtering to address this issue. \n\nTheory is also present in the text as the paper discusses the problem of redundancy in deductive problem solvers and proposes a theoretical solution in the form of utilization filtering. The paper also presents experimental results to support the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
