The resulting model is a mixture model for probabilistic principal component analysers, whose parameters can be determined using an EM algorithm. The paper discusses the advantages of this model in the context of clustering, density modelling, and local dimensionality reduction, and demonstrates its application to image compression and handwritten digit recognition. There is no mention of other sub-categories of AI such as Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Rule Learning, or Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
