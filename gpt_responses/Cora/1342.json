This paper belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks. The paper discusses the centering of various factors involved in the network's gradient to improve credit assignment in networks with shortcut connections. The benchmark results show that this approach can speed up learning without adversely affecting the trained network's generalization ability. The paper does not discuss any other sub-categories of AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
