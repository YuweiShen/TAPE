The paper discusses policies for the agent, which is a function that assigns an action to every history of observations and actions. The paper also discusses feedback structures in partially observable processes. \n\nTheory is present in the paper as it discusses the existence of an efficient stochastic policy that ensures that the competitive ratio is obtained at almost all stages with an arbitrarily high probability, where efficiency is measured in terms of rate of convergence. The paper also discusses the maxmin criterion and proves that a deterministic efficient optimal strategy does exist in the imperfect monitoring case under this criterion. Finally, the paper shows that their approach to long-run optimality can be viewed as qualitative, which distinguishes it from previous work in this area."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
