Specifically, the paper uses a qualitative Markov assumption to model state transitions as independent, which is a probabilistic concept. The paper also mentions a recent approach to modeling qualitative uncertainty using plausibility measures, which is another probabilistic method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
