The experts adapt their width to match the noise level in their regime, and the gating network learns to predict the probability of each expert given the input. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper discusses the underlying statistical assumptions and derives weight update rules. The gating network predicts the probability of each expert given the input, and the experts learn to match their variances to the local noise levels, which can be viewed as matching the local complexity of the model to the local complexity of the data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
