This approach is based on probabilistic methods, which involve modeling uncertainty and making predictions based on probability distributions. The paper also mentions that the method assumes a normally distributed target noise and provides estimates of model misspecification, which are both probabilistic concepts. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Probabilistic Methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
