POMDP is a probabilistic method that allows for modeling uncertainty in the underlying disease and patient response to treatment.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper discusses finding the optimal therapy within the POMDP framework, which is a problem that can be solved using reinforcement learning techniques. The authors also investigate approximation methods to simplify the model construction process and solve larger therapy problems faster, which is a common approach in reinforcement learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
