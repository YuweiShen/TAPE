The paper focuses on how to update beliefs in these networks as new evidence is observed, which is a key aspect of probabilistic reasoning. While other sub-categories of AI may also be relevant to this topic (such as reinforcement learning for decision-making in uncertain environments), probabilistic methods are the most directly applicable."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
