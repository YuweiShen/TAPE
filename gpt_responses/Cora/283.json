It discusses the limitations of existing learning algorithms for neural networks and proposes a new approach that is inspired by biological systems with many hidden units. The proposed algorithm is a feedforward or recurrent neural network that is designed to deal with hidden units and units whose past activations are hidden in time.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper discusses the credit assignment problem in learning algorithms for dynamic neural networks in non-stationary environments. It proposes a parallel on-line learning algorithm that performs local computations only and is designed to deal with hidden units. The approach is inspired by Holland's idea of the bucket brigade for classifier systems, which is a form of reinforcement learning. The proposed algorithm is a feedforward or recurrent neural network that is consuming weight-substance and permanently trying to distribute this substance onto its connections in an appropriate way."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
