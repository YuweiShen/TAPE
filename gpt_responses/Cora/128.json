This is evident from the text where it is mentioned that \"A Reinforcement Learning method is selected, which is able to adapt a controller such that a cost function is optimised. An estimate of the cost function is learned by a neural `critic'.\" The paper describes the use of a neural network to learn an optimal controller for the attitude control of a satellite, which is a classic example of Reinforcement Learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
