The algorithm is benchmarked against principal component analysis in experiments on images of handwritten digits.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper discusses the doctrine of unconscious inference, which argues that perceptions are formed by the interaction of bottom-up sensory data with top-down expectations. The up-propagation algorithm utilizes a negative feedback loop driven by an error signal from the bottom-up connections, which is also used for learning the connections. This error signal is a probabilistic measure of the difference between the generated pattern and the sensory input."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
