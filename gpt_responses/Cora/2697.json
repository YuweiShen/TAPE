The authors propose a probabilistic logic-based approach to belief maintenance that can handle uncertain and incomplete information.\n\nRule Learning: This paper also belongs to the sub-category of Rule Learning as the authors propose a rule-based approach to belief maintenance. They use a set of rules to update beliefs based on new evidence and to resolve conflicts between beliefs. The rules are learned from examples and can be refined over time."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
