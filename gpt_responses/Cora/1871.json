The method has been applied to feature extraction in the context of recognizing 3D objects from single 2D views (Intrator and Gold, 1991).\n\nTheory: The paper discusses the relevance of the extracted features to the theory and psychophysics of object recognition. It also mentions recent statistical theory (Huber, 1985; Friedman, 1987) that is related to the feature extraction method proposed by Intrator (1990)."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
