The authors use probabilistic methods to estimate the parameters of the regression model and to make predictions. They also use regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.\n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks as the authors use a neural network to model the system identification problem. They use a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer to estimate the output of the system. The authors also use regularization techniques to prevent overfitting in the neural network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
