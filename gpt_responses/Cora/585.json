Additionally, the two approaches to addressing noise in the relational concept learning algorithm involve using probabilistic models to estimate the likelihood of noise in the data.\n\nRule Learning: The paper focuses on developing algorithms for learning relational concepts, which can be seen as a form of rule learning.
