These models likely involve neural networks, which are modeled after the structure and function of the brain.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper discusses the role of experience in the development of the visual system, and how carefully controlled manipulation of the environment can reveal specific developmental or learning mechanisms. This suggests that reinforcement learning may be a relevant sub-category of AI for understanding perceptual development."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
