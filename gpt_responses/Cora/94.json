The Coupling from the Past (CFTP) method proposed by Propp and Wilson is a probabilistic method that delivers perfect simulations of Markov chains. The paper also mentions the equilibrium distribution of a spatial birth-and-death process, which is a probabilistic concept. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
