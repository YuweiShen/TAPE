The model includes multiple layers of processing units that are interconnected in a way that mimics the organization of the retina. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper also uses probabilistic methods to model the variability in the responses of individual cone cells and the noise in the visual signal. The authors use a Bayesian framework to estimate the parameters of the model and to make predictions about the behavior of the system under different conditions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
