The network architecture is discussed and compared to other methods.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper focuses on predicting the full distribution instead of just the mean, and presents a method to transform the problem from a regression to a classification problem. The conditional probability distribution network is used to perform direct and iterated predictions, and is compared to a nearest-neighbor predictor. The paper also discusses the differences between their method and fuzzy logic."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
