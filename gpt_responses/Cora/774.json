The authors explain how the self-organizing map provides dimensionality reduction and invariance to minor changes in the image sample, while the convolutional neural network provides partial invariance to translation, rotation, scale, and deformation. They also discuss how the convolutional network extracts successively larger features in a hierarchical set of layers.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The authors mention that the recognizer provides a measure of confidence in its output, and that classification error approaches zero when rejecting as few as 10% of the examples. They also analyze computational complexity and discuss how new classes could be added to the trained recognizer. These aspects suggest the use of probabilistic methods in the approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
