It uses a probabilistic model to estimate the probability of a bag being positive or negative based on the instances it contains.\n\nCase Based: The paper describes the application of the Diverse Density framework to learn a simple description of a person from a series of images (bags) containing that person. This is an example of a case-based approach, where the system learns from specific instances (bags) rather than general rules."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
