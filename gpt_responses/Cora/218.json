The paper introduces Bayesian techniques for splitting, smoothing, and tree averaging. The splitting rule is similar to Quinlan's information gain, while smoothing and averaging replace pruning. The comparative experiments show that the full Bayesian algorithm can produce more accurate predictions than other approaches."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
