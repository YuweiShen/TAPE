This involves developing networks for performing analysis tasks such as pose and expression estimation, face recognition, and face detection in cluttered scenes. These networks are based on neural networks, which are a type of machine learning algorithm that can learn from examples.\n\nCase Based: The paper also mentions the use of descriptive parameters for labeling example face images and \"near miss\" faces for the problem of face detection. This is an example of case-based reasoning, which involves solving new problems by adapting solutions that were used to solve similar problems in the past. In this case, the descriptive parameters are used to train the example-based learning networks for face analysis and synthesis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
