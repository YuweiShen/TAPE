It measures the performance of a standard genetic algorithm and introduces a new genetic algorithm, the multi-phase annealed GA, which exhibits superior performance. The paper also discusses modifications made to the genetic algorithm, such as changes in input representation and systematic local search, to improve its performance.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The genetic algorithm is a probabilistic method that uses randomization to search for solutions. The paper discusses the use of random graphs and embedded cliques in the problem instances. The paper also discusses the need for diversity enhancement to avoid premature convergence to local minima."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
