The IQ-algorithm is a form of reinforcement learning that allows agents to learn how to act by observing or imitating other agents. \n\nImitation learning is also a key aspect of the paper, as the IQ-algorithm uses observations of an expert agent to bias exploration in promising directions. The algorithm allows for transfer between agents with different objectives and abilities, which is a form of imitation learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
