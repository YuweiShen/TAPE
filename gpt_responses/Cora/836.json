While the paper mentions supervised learning, it also argues that constructive induction can be used in an unsupervised regime, but it does not focus on any specific sub-category of AI such as case-based, genetic algorithms, neural networks, probabilistic methods, reinforcement learning, or rule learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
