The approach involves providing approximate advice about the link- and page-scoring functions, which is then mapped into neural network implementations. The subsequent reinforcements from the Web and user ratings are used to refine the functions. The paper also presents a case study and an empirical study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
