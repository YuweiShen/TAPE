This paper belongs to the sub-category of Reinforcement Learning as it discusses the comparison between indirect and direct reinforcement learning methods for an infinite horizon Markov decision problem with unknown state-transition probabilities. The paper also suggests that given a fixed amount of computational power available per control action, it may be better to use a direct reinforcement learning method augmented with indirect techniques than to devote all available resources to a computationally costly indirect method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
