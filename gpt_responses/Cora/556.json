The paper focuses on proving upper and lower bounds on the number of pebbles needed for efficient mapping, and provides deterministic algorithms for both cases. There is no application or implementation of AI techniques such as case-based reasoning, genetic algorithms, neural networks, probabilistic methods, or reinforcement learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
