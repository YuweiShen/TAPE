The paper discusses how the robot's policy is updated based on the rewards received from the environment, and how the robot can learn to adapt to new tasks and environments over time.\n\nNeural Networks are also present in the paper as the authors use deep neural networks to represent the robot's policy and value functions. The paper discusses how the neural networks are trained using backpropagation and how they are used to predict the expected rewards for different actions in different states. The paper also discusses how the neural networks are updated over time as the robot learns from new experiences."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
