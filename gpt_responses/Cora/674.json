The model learns to map forms onto meanings and makes phonological generalizations that are embedded in connection weights. \n\nRule Learning: The paper discusses the use of suffixation, prefixation, and template rules in the experiments with artificial stimuli. The model learns to apply these rules to different morphological categories, which enables transfer."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
