The authors describe how the system generates rules from examples and how it can be used to learn new rules from data. \n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Theory because it presents a theoretical framework for constructive induction and discusses the limitations of existing approaches. The authors propose a new approach based on AQ17-DCI and provide experimental results to support their claims.
