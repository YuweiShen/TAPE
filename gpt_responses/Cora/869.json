It uses the Boltzmann distribution to choose codewords based on their lengths, which is a probabilistic method. The paper also presents a binary Bayesian network model that assigns exponentially many codewords to each symbol, which is another example of probabilistic modeling."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
