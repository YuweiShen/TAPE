The neural network is trained using real-time graphical user inputs or an auxiliary infrared detector as supervisory signals, and the inputs to the network consist of normalized luminance and chrominance images and motion information from frame differences. The paper also describes how the neural network rapidly adjusts the input weights during the online training phase, allowing the system to robustly track a head even in a cluttered background. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Neural Networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
