The authors describe their adaptation of the approach used by Uberbacher and Mural to identify coding regions in human DNA, and compare the performance of ANNs to several conventional methods for predicting reading frames. The experiments demonstrate that ANNs can outperform these conventional approaches. Therefore, the paper primarily belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
