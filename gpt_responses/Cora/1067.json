The algorithm is simple and fast to converge to the most accurate solution allowed by the data. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The algorithm tends to all non-Gaussian independent components, regardless of their probability distributions. The convergence of the algorithm is rigorously proven, and the convergence speed is shown to be cubic."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
