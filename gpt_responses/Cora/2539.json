These algorithms are probabilistic in nature, as they use statistical models to make predictions based on the available data.\n\nRule Learning: The paper also discusses the use of propositional machine learning algorithms, which are based on the extraction of rules from the available data. These rules can be used to make predictions or to identify patterns in the data. The algorithm for Relational Regression is an example of a rule learning algorithm, as it utilizes all the information contained in the relations of the database to make predictions."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
