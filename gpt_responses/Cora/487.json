The authors describe how neural networks can be used to simulate the behavior of language systems and how they can be trained to learn patterns in language data. \n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding language as a dynamical system. The authors draw on concepts from dynamical systems theory, such as attractors and bifurcations, to explain how language systems evolve over time. They also discuss the implications of this framework for understanding language acquisition, language change, and language processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
