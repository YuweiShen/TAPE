This approach is based on the principles of genetic algorithms, where a population of candidate solutions is evolved over generations through selection, crossover, and mutation. The paper also mentions that the new method is inspired by the success of genetic algorithms in solving optimization problems.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper mentions that the new method is a simple and efficient adaptive scheme for global optimization over continuous spaces. The approach is based on the principles of stochastic optimization, where the candidate solutions are perturbed randomly to explore the search space. The paper also mentions that the new method is robust and easy to use, which are desirable properties of probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
