The comparison is made between the Support Vector machine and a classical approach that uses error backpropagation, which is a common training method for neural networks.\n\nTheory: The paper is based on statistical learning theory and discusses the theoretical foundations of the Support Vector machine. The authors also mention that the SV approach is not only theoretically well-founded but also superior in practical applications."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
