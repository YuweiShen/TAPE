The genotype of each network is represented as a tree and genetic operators are used to adapt the depth and width of the tree. \n\nNeural Networks: The paper focuses on optimizing the architecture and connection weights of multilayer feedforward neural networks. The weights are trained using a next-ascent hillclimbing search. The fitness function proposed in the paper quantifies the principle of Occam's razor, which makes an optimal trade-off between the error fitting ability and the parsimony of the network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
