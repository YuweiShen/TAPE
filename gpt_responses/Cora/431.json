The central objective of the method is to induce compact, easily interpretable solutions. \n\nProbabilistic Methods are also present as the paper mentions that the new techniques are competitive with existing machine learning and statistical methods and can sometimes yield superior regression performance. This suggests that the method involves some form of probabilistic modeling or inference."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
