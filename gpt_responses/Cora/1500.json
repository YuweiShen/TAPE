The approach is based on a hill-climbing procedure, which is a type of search algorithm commonly used in rule learning. The paper also discusses the trade-off between predictive accuracy and intelligibility, which is a theoretical issue in the field of machine learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
