The paper describes the algorithm for learning the correct mapping from the input (state) vector to the output (steering) signal using rules from Temporal Difference learning. \n\nRule learning is also present in the paper, as the system learns rules for avoiding collisions based on the reinforcement signal. The algorithm used for a discrete coding of the input state space also involves the creation of rules for mapping the input space to the output signal."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
