The model uses long-term potentiation and long-term depression to encode memories, which are processes that involve changes in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding how the hippocampal system may rapidly transform transient patterns of activity into persistent structural encodings. The model is based on the idea that the HS uses Hebbian learning to strengthen connections between neurons that are active at the same time, and weaken connections between neurons that are not. The paper also discusses the broader implications of the model for understanding memory formation and retrieval in the brain."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
