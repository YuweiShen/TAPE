The study involved applying the algorithm to a wide range of learning problems using a variety of different internal architectures.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper discusses the statistical effects that may need to be exploited in supervised learning and proposes that learning algorithms will typically have some form of bias towards particular classes of effect. It also shows how the existence of statistical bias in backpropagation constitutes a weakness in the algorithm's ability to discount noise."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
