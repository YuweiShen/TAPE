This paper belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks as it introduces a novel method called \"Long Short-Term Memory\" (LSTM) for learning to store information over extended time intervals via recurrent backpropagation. The paper compares LSTM with other recurrent network algorithms and shows that LSTM leads to many more successful runs and learns much faster. The paper also discusses the computational complexity of LSTM and its ability to solve complex, artificial long time lag tasks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
