The network dynamics developed by Griniasty, Tsodyks & Amit (1993) are used to achieve this goal. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper uses an independent component (ICA) representation of the faces for the input patterns. The ICA representation has advantages over the principal component representation (PCA) for viewpoint-invariant recognition both with and without the attractor network. This suggests that ICA is a better representation than PCA for object recognition."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
