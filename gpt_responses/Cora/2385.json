Receptive fields are modeled using artificial neural networks in many computer vision applications.\n\nTheory: The paper surveys the possible computational reasons behind the ubiquity of receptive fields in vision, discussing examples of RF-based solutions to problems in vision, from spatial acuity, through sensory coding, to object recognition. The paper also discusses the organization of the mammalian visual system as retinotopic maps, which is a theoretical framework for understanding visual processing."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
