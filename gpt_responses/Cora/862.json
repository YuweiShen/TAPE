This system uses the rules implicit in the training data to generate phonetic transcriptions. The use of training data and rules implies a probabilistic approach to the problem.\n\nRule Learning: The system described in the paper is based on learning the rules for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion from training data. The system takes as input the spelling of words and produces as output the phonetic transcription according to the learned rules.
