The authors propose using reinforcement learning techniques to enable agents to learn complimentary policies without any knowledge about each other. They also experimentally verify the effects of learning rate on system convergence and demonstrate the benefits of using learned coordination knowledge on similar problems.\n\nTheory is also a relevant sub-category as the paper discusses formal models of conflict and cooperation among agent interests and analyzes the effects of learning rate on system convergence. The authors also discuss the potential benefits of using reinforcement learning-based coordination in domains with noisy communication channels and other stochastic characteristics."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
