The learning is performed under simulation, and the resulting behaviors are then used to control the actual robot. The paper also briefly explains the learning algorithm used, which is based on genetic algorithms. While other sub-categories of AI may be involved in the overall approach, the focus of the paper is on the use of genetic algorithms for learning robot behaviors."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
