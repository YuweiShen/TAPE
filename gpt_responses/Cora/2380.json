The authors use a probability propagation algorithm adopted from Bayesian reasoning systems to perform probabilistic reasoning. \n\nCase Based: The paper focuses on case-based reasoning and proposes a solution to the case matching and adaptation problems. The authors argue that using their approach, the difficult problem of case indexing can be completely avoided. \n\nNeural Networks: The authors show how the proposed algorithm can be implemented as a connectionist network, where efficient massively parallel case retrieval is an inherent property of the system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
