This method is compared to other hypothesis-driven new attribute construction methods, and the new idea is that it carries out systematic search with pruning over each path of a tree to select conditions for generating a conjunction. Therefore, conditions for constructing new attributes are dynamically decided during search. This approach falls under the sub-category of Rule Learning. \n\nThe paper also evaluates the performance of the method in terms of both higher prediction accuracy and lower theory complexity, which falls under the sub-category of Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
