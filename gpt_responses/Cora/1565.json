The GA acts on all of the classes at once and measures fitness as classification accuracy, allowing the system to profit from global information about class interaction. \n\nNeural Networks: The paper presents the concept of a receptive field for each prototype, which is used to replace the classical, fixed distance-based membership function by an infinite fuzzy support membership function. This new membership function is inspired by that used in the hidden layer of RBF networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
