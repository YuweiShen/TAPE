The TDNN is used to process irregular-length schedules and is shown to match the performance of a previous hand-engineered system.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper formulates the job-shop scheduling task for solution by the reinforcement learning algorithm T D(). The TD() algorithm is used to learn from experience and improve the quality of the resulting schedules. The paper shows that the TDNN-TD() network significantly outperforms the best previous (non-learning) solution to this problem in terms of the quality of the resulting schedules and the number of search steps required to construct them."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
