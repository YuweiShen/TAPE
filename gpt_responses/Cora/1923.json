Both PCA and SPCA are probabilistic methods that involve modeling the covariance of datasets and finding the leading eigenvectors. The EM algorithm is a probabilistic method for estimating the parameters of a statistical model when there are missing data. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Probabilistic Methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
