This is evident from the title and abstract, which both refer to \"Conversational case-based reasoning\" as the focus of the paper. The paper describes a system named NaCoDAE, which is a form of case-based reasoning where users input a partial problem description and the system responds with a ranked solution display based on stored cases. The paper also discusses the use of implication rules to support dialogue inferencing, which is a key aspect of case-based reasoning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
