The paper includes a detailed explanation of the Q-Learning algorithm and how it can be extended to work with multiple grids. Overall, the focus of the paper is on using reinforcement learning to solve complex problems, making it a clear example of this sub-category of AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
