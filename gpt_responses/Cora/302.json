Confidence estimation is a probabilistic method that involves predicting the likelihood of correct outcomes for data and control decisions, and using this information to determine whether to execute operations speculatively or not. The paper compares different confidence estimation mechanisms and evaluates their performance using detailed pipeline simulations."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
