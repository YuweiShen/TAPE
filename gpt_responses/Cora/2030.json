These constraint functions can be seen as probabilistic methods, as they provide a measure of uncertainty in the modeling process.\n\nRule Learning: The paper suggests using the values of the model constraint functions as constraint inputs to a standard constrained nonlinear optimization numerical method. This can be seen as a form of rule learning, as the system is learning how to use the model constraint functions to guide the search process."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
