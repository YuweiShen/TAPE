The network is calibrated to the higher-order moments of the input density functions, and it factorises the input into independent components. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The algorithm is derived from the mutual information objective, which involves maximising the mutual information between outputs and inputs of the network. The paper also mentions the minimisation of mutual information between outputs, as well as maximising their individual entropies. The example application of blind separation of speech signals also involves probabilistic modelling of the input signals."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
