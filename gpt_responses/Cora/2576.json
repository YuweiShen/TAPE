The model is based on the idea that the brain uses a combination of visual and motor information to estimate distance. The authors use a neural network to simulate the behavior of the model and show that it can accurately predict the perceived distance of objects in different visual contexts.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding how the brain represents egocentric distance. The authors review previous research on the topic and propose a new model that integrates visual and motor information. They also discuss the implications of their model for understanding the neural basis of perception and action."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
