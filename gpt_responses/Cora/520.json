The approach involves using probabilistic methods to model the relationships between various clinical and genetic factors and the likelihood of a patient having cancer or developing cancer in the future. The authors use logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models, which are both probabilistic methods, to build their predictive models. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of AI called Probabilistic Methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
