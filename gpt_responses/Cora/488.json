This paper belongs to the Theory sub-category of AI. The paper presents a new general-purpose algorithm for learning classes of [0; 1]-valued functions and proves a general upper bound on the expected absolute error of this algorithm in terms of a scale-sensitive generalization of the Vapnik dimension. The paper also applies this result to obtain new upper bounds on packing numbers and sample complexity of agnostic learning. The paper does not discuss Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Probabilistic Methods, Reinforcement Learning, or Rule Learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
