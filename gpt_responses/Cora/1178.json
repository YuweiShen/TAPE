The paper explains how STGP addresses the limitation of \"closure\" in traditional genetic programming, and introduces key concepts such as generic functions and generic data types. The examples presented in the paper involve manipulating vectors, matrices, and lists, which are all common data structures used in genetic programming."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
