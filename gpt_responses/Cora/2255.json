The authors use a fitness function to evaluate the performance of different crossover operators and evolve them over multiple generations. The paper also discusses the use of mutation and selection operators, which are key components of genetic algorithms. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Genetic Algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
