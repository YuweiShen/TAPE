The main result is the simulation of all Turing machines by nets, including the computation of a universal partial-recursive function. The paper also updates previous results to include the simulation of binary-tape machines. There is no mention of any other sub-category of AI in the text."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
