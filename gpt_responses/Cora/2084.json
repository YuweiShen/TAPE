The network was optimized over a set of normal and abnormal heartbeats, and the classification error rate was reduced by a factor of 2. The weights and unit activations of the optimized network were analyzed to reduce the size of the network without loss of accuracy.\n\nRule Learning: The neural network was synthesized from a rule-based classifier, indicating the use of rule learning techniques in the development of the network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
