It focuses on uni-variate models for collections of related time series assumedly driven by underlying but unobservable processes, referred to as dynamic latent factor processes. The models use time-varying autoregressions capable of flexibly representing ranges of observed non-stationary characteristics. The paper also highlights concepts and new methods of time series decomposition to infer characteristics of latent components in time series, which is a probabilistic method. The paper discusses current and future research directions in this area."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
