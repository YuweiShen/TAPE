The paper focuses on the use of genetic algorithms as a search method to find optimal solutions to the problem. While other sub-categories of AI may also be relevant to job shop scheduling, such as rule learning or probabilistic methods, the paper specifically emphasizes the use of genetic algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
