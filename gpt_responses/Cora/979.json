The experiments described in the paper involve feedforward and recurrent neural networks. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The paper uses a Bayesian argument based on a Gibbs algorithm variant and a novel way of splitting generalization error into underfitting and overfitting error. The argument suggests that flat minima correspond to \"simple\" networks and low expected overfitting. The paper also mentions that their approach does not require Gaussian assumptions and has a prior over input/output functions, thus taking into account net architecture and training set."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
