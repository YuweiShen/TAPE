The authors state that \"the structures are generated using a genetic algorithm that evolves a population of candidate solutions.\" \n\nReinforcement Learning is also present in the text as the authors mention the use of a \"fitness function\" to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolved structures. This fitness function is used to provide feedback to the genetic algorithm, allowing it to improve the structures over time through reinforcement learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
