The authors also discuss the architecture and learning process of these networks.\n\nCase Based: The paper discusses the use of kernel estimators, such as k-nearest neighbor, Parzen windows, generalized k-nn, and Grow and Learn, which are memory-based methods that rely on previously seen examples to classify new data. This falls under the category of case-based reasoning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
