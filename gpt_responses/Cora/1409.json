The paper focuses on evolving functional or reactive programs using Genetic Programming. \n\nReinforcement Learning is present in the text as the approach uses a multi-phasic fitness environment that enforces the use of memory and allows the evolved programs to learn from their environment. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of the approach by using an illustrative problem of 'gold' collection, where the evolved programs store simple representations of their environments and use these representations to produce simple plans."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
