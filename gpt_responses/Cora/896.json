It also uses a divergence criterion derived from Kemeny and Snell (1960) to assess convergence, which is a probabilistic method. \n\nTheory: The paper discusses general convergence properties on finite state spaces and uses Birkhoff's pointwise ergodic theorem for stopping rules. These are theoretical concepts used in the analysis of Markov chains."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
