The potential solutions are represented as variable length mathematical LISP S-expressions, and the approach employs a fixed set of non-problem-specific functions to solve a variety of problems. \n\nRule Learning: The paper discusses the usefulness of the encoding schema in discovering learning rules for supervised learning problems, with an emphasis on hard learning problems. The potential solutions are represented as mathematical expressions, which can be seen as rules for solving the problems. The paper also discusses future research directions within the context of GP practices, which includes rule learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
