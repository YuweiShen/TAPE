The paper explores an exploratory model that uses neural networks to understand how gene regulation affects biological development. While other sub-categories of AI may also be relevant to this topic, such as genetic algorithms or probabilistic methods, the primary focus of the paper is on neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
