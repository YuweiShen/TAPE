The paper discusses how to evaluate these probabilities when prior knowledge is available on the causal mechanisms governing the domain, and also when causal knowledge is specified as conditional probabilities on the observables. The paper demonstrates the use of these techniques in two applications related to treatment efficacy and product-safety litigation. All of these aspects are related to probabilistic methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
