The paper provides a sufficient condition for convergence of these algorithms with respect to a given norm, and applies the results to the specific problem of estimating Poisson rate parameters in emission tomography. The paper does not discuss any other sub-categories of AI such as Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Rule Learning, or Theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
