The paper explains how genetic algorithms are based on the model of organic evolution and how they are applied to the subset sum, maximum cut, and minimum tardy task problems. The paper also mentions that no problem-specific changes are required for the genetic algorithm to achieve high-quality results.\n\nProbabilistic methods are also present in the paper, as genetic algorithms are a type of probabilistic search algorithm. The paper explains how genetic algorithms sample only a tiny fraction of the search space, yet are still able to find the global optimum within a number of runs. The paper also mentions how constraints are taken into account by incorporating a graded penalty term into the fitness function."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
