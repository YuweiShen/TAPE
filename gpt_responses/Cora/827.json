The parameters of these models may be estimated by linear multiple regression. These models are comparable with PC and IC, which rely on conditional independence. The use of probabilistic methods is evident in the estimation of the parameters of the models through linear multiple regression."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
