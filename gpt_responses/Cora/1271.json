The system features an advanced interface that makes it intuitive for people to manipulate data and discover significant relationships. The system encapsulates data within objects and defines generic protocols that mediate all interactions between data, users and analysis algorithms. \n\nCase Based is present in the text as the SHER-FACS International Conflict Management dataset is used as an empirical study for the Feature Vector Editor. The more sophisticated research reformulates SHERFACS conflict codings as machine-parsable narratives suitable for processing into semantic representations by the RELATUS Natural Language System. Experiments with 244 SHERFACS cases demonstrated the feasibility of building knowledge bases from synthetic texts exceeding 600 pages."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
