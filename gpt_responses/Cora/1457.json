The algorithm creates an initial population and uses genetic operators to continually create new networks, keeping the set of networks that are highly accurate while disagreeing with each other as much as possible. \n\nNeural Networks: The paper discusses the use of neural-network ensembles, which is a technique where the outputs of a set of separately trained neural networks are combined to form one unified prediction. The paper presents an algorithm that uses genetic algorithms to create a set of highly accurate and diverse neural networks for an effective ensemble. The experiments conducted in the paper also show that the proposed algorithm is able to generate a set of trained networks that is more accurate than several existing ensemble approaches."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
