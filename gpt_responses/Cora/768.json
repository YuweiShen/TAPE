The authors also use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to estimate the parameters of the DCIMs.\n\nTheory: The paper presents theoretical results on the identifiability of DCIMs and the convergence properties of MCMC methods for estimating their parameters. The authors also provide a detailed description of the DCIM framework and its application to real-world data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
