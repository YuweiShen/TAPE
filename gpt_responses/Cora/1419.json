The focus is on examining the posterior distribution in both polar and Cartesian co-ordinates, which is a probabilistic approach. The paper compares different Bayesian and Classical estimators, which are all probabilistic methods for estimating parameters of a distribution."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
