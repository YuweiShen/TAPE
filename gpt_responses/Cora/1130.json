The algorithm moves from a coarse-grained search to a fine-grained search of the function space by changing its mutation rate, which is a key feature of genetic algorithms. \n\nProbabilistic Methods: The algorithm uses a diversity-based distance metric to ensure that it searches new regions of the space, which is a probabilistic method."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
