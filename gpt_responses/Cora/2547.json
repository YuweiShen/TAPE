This indicates the use of probabilistic methods in the pre-processing and analysis of the data.\n\nCase Based: The paper also describes how Intelligent Data Analysis methods may be used to index past cases and perform a case-based retrieval in a database of past cases. This indicates the use of case-based reasoning in the analysis of the data."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
