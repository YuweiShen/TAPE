The paper specifically focuses on generative learning algorithms for these networks, which allow for adaptive determination of the network architecture and connectivity based on experience. The paper also discusses alternative designs and control structures for regulating the internal representations learned by these networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
