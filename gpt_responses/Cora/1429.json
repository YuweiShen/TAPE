This involves the system learning rules or clauses that define the relation based on examples and background information. \n- Theory: The paper is focused on developing a theoretical understanding of how to improve first-order learning for functional relations, and presents experimental results to support the proposed approach."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
