The method involves evaluating hypothetical rule sets on a simulator and applying simulated evolution to evolve more effective rules. \n\nRule Learning: The paper's main contribution is the learning of decision rules for a complex shepherding task involving multiple mobile robots. The learned rules are verified through experiments on operational mobile robots."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
