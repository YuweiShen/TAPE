The authors use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from raw sensor data, which are then used to predict the robot's actions. \n\nReinforcement Learning: The authors use a reinforcement learning framework to train the neural network. The robot receives a reward signal based on its performance in reaching the goal, and the neural network is updated to maximize this reward. The authors also use a technique called experience replay, where the robot's experiences are stored in a buffer and used to train the neural network in an offline manner."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
