The approach to place recognition relies on nearest neighbor classification, augmented by a registration process to correct for translational differences between the two grids. The learning mechanism is lazy in that it involves the simple storage of inferred evidence grids. The paper also discusses experimental studies with physical and simulated robots that suggest the approach improves place recognition with experience, can handle significant sensor noise, benefits from improved quality in stored cases, and scales well to environments with many distinct places. While the paper does not explicitly mention other sub-categories of AI, it is clear that probabilistic methods are the primary focus of the research."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
