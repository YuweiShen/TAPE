This technique is based on a decomposition method originally developed for the design of switching circuits and recently extended to handle incompletely specified multi-valued functions. The paper also evaluates the method on a number of test functions and shows that the decomposition hierarchy does not depend on a given repertoire of basic functions (background knowledge). This work is primarily focused on developing a theoretical method for constructing intermediate concepts, which falls under the category of Theory in AI. Additionally, the method involves the use of symbolic representations and logical rules, which aligns with the sub-category of Rule Learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
