The nonlinear transformation used in the method is also described as a distortion, which is a common term used in neural network literature. The paper also discusses the development of new on-line un-supervised adaptive learning rules for the neural network implementation. Therefore, this paper belongs to the sub-category of AI known as Neural Networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
