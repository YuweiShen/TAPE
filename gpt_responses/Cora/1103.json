Neural networks are present in the text as the paper discusses the use of artificial neural networks for time series analysis. The paper describes how neural networks can be used to model and predict time series data, and how they can be trained using backpropagation and other techniques. The paper also discusses the advantages and limitations of using neural networks for time series analysis."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
