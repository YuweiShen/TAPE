The approach is based on applying the notion of a matching loss function in two different contexts.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a unified treatment that generalizes earlier results for the gradient descent and exponentiated gradient algorithms to multidimensional outputs, including multiclass logistic regression. The authors also discuss the use of a parameterization function and its role in transforming parameter vectors maintained by the algorithm into the actual weights. The paper also discusses the use of a loss function as a measure of distance between models and as a potential function in analyzing the relative performance of the algorithm compared to an arbitrary fixed model."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
