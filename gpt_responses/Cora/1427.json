MML is a probabilistic method that seeks to minimize the length of the message required to describe the data and the model, and it is compared to Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis. The paper also discusses the conditions for the existence of an MML estimate, which is based on the log likelihood ratio."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
