The focus is on the precision or total mass parameter of the mixing Dirichlet process, which is a critical hyperparameter that strongly influences resulting inferences about numbers of mixture components. The paper proposes a flexible class of prior distributions for this parameter and shows how the posterior may be represented in a simple conditional form that is easily simulated. The paper also discusses the use of data augmentation and provides an asymptotic approximation to the posterior. All of these are characteristic of probabilistic methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
