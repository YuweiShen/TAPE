The authors discuss the design and stability analysis of these models, and provide examples of their application. While other sub-categories of AI may also be relevant to this topic, such as reinforcement learning or probabilistic methods, the primary focus of the paper is on neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
