The model is used to predict future reinforcements and determine good actions directly from the knowledge of the model network.\n\nReinforcement Learning: The paper describes a planning method that maximizes future reinforcement to derive suboptimal plans. This is done through gradient descent in action space, which is a common technique in reinforcement learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
