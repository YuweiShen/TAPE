The paper discusses how the network tends to divide labor between the two expert modules, with one expert specializing in face processing and the other specializing in nonface object processing. The paper also discusses how the network's performance on face recognition decreases dramatically as one of the experts is progressively damaged, which is similar to data reported for prosopagnosic patients. Therefore, the paper primarily belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
