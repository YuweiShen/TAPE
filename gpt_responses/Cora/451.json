It describes the incremental design of a set of heuristic decision functions and carefully derives the properties of such heuristics under a set of simplifying assumptions about the network topology and load dynamics. The paper concludes with a discussion of the relevance of the theoretical results presented in the paper to the design of intelligent autonomous adaptive communication networks and outlines some directions of future research.
