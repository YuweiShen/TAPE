It also discusses variants of CGAs that always maintain the best solution in the population, either before or after selection. \n\nTheory: The paper uses homogeneous finite Markov chain analysis to prove that a CGA will never converge to the global optimum regardless of the initialization, crossover operator and objective function. It also discusses the schema theorem in relation to the results."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
