Specifically, it uses a Markov Random Field (MRF) model to capture the spatial dependencies between the voxels in the image. The paper also uses a Bayesian framework to estimate the parameters of the MRF model.\n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks because it uses a neural network to learn the appearance model of the object being segmented. Specifically, it uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn a feature representation of the object from a set of training images. The learned features are then used to compute the likelihood of each voxel belonging to the object."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
