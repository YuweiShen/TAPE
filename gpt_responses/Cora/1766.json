This involves probabilistic methods such as reducing variance in localization by integrating spatial information from visual and auditory systems.\n\nNeural Networks: The paper discusses specific models of integration and adaptation resulting from the computational framework, which involve neural networks that simulate the dynamic behavior of the arm and predict the effects of remapping in the relation between visual and auditory space.\n\nTheory: The paper presents psychophysical results from two sensorimotor systems and analyzes them within the computational framework, providing evidence for the existence of an internal model that simulates the dynamic behavior of the arm and captures the temporal propagation of errors in estimating the hand's state. This demonstrates the theoretical underpinnings of the sensorimotor integration system."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
