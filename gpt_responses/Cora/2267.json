The paper also discusses the use of a fitness function that incorporates the principle of Occam's razor to find minimal size networks. Neural networks are the subject of optimization in this paper, and the authors propose a method to evolve optimal neural networks using genetic algorithms."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
