It also belongs to the sub-category of Genetic Algorithms because it uses an evolving representation to restructure the search space and create new designs. The evolving representation is similar to the genetic representation used in genetic algorithms, where the search space is explored by generating new solutions through the manipulation of existing ones."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
