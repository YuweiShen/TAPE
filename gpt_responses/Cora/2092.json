The paper also presents a randomized implementation that is faster in practice. The paper then explains how these algorithms can be applied to other problems, such as combining the predictions of statistical language models, where the resulting guarantees are more striking. There is no mention or application of Case Based, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Probabilistic Methods, Reinforcement Learning, or Rule Learning in the text."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
