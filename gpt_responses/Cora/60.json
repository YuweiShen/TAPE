The agent learns to solve a set of composite and elemental MDTs by producing a temporal decomposition. The paper also belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks as it presents a modular network architecture that allows a single learning agent to learn to solve multiple MDTs with significant transfer of learning across the tasks. The architecture is trained on a set of composite and elemental MDTs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
