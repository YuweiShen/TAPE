Additionally, the paper proposes several \"predictive\" controllers that use time derivatives to predict the next position of a moving object. These controllers also utilize neural networks to make these predictions. Therefore, the paper primarily belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
