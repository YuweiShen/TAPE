The paper also mentions the use of an artificial market economy for arriving at overall judgments of worth, which can be seen as a probabilistic approach to decision-making.\n\nTheory: The paper discusses the theoretical foundations of rational planning and replanning, including the need to revise plans incrementally and locally based on expected utility, and the importance of identifying and revising only those parts of a plan that are worth revising. The paper also discusses the need for a representation of qualitative preferences, which is a theoretical concept in decision theory."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
