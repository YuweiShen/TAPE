It discusses the use of recurrent neural networks for classifying strings of a regular language and extracting rules defining the learned grammar.\n\nRule Learning: The paper specifically deals with the extraction of deterministic finite-state automata (DFA's) from recurrent neural networks, which can be seen as a form of rule learning. The paper also introduces a heuristic for selecting the best DFA among the consistent models extracted from the network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
