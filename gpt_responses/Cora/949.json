This paper belongs to the sub-category of Neural Networks in AI. The paper proposes a classification scheme based on the integration of multiple Ensembles of ANNs (Artificial Neural Networks) for a seismic signal classification problem. The ANNs within the Ensembles are aggregated using Bagging, and the Ensembles are integrated non-linearly using a posterior confidence measure based on the agreement within the Ensembles. The paper demonstrates that such integration of a collection of ANN's Ensembles is a robust way for handling high dimensional problems with a complex non-stationary signal space as in the current Seismic Classification problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
