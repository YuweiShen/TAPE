Each weak heuristic maintains a local cache of the collective memory, which is used to guide the search. The impact of the distribution of the collective memory on the distributed search is also examined.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for integrating weak and strong search heuristics using collective memory to solve a hard combinatorial optimization problem. The authors construct a family of graphs, FC, to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. They also analyze the impact of various characteristics of the distribution of the collective memory and the search algorithms on the distributed search."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
