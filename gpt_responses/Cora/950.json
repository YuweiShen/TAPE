The authors discuss Bayesian model selection for generalized linear models, which is a probabilistic approach to model selection. They use the GLIB algorithm, which is a Bayesian model selection algorithm based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The authors also discuss the use of prior distributions in Bayesian model selection, which is a key aspect of probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
