The performance of the algorithm is measured by the difference between the expected number of mistakes it makes on the bit sequence and the expected number of mistakes made by the best expert on this sequence, where the expectation is taken with respect to the randomization in the predictions. \n\nTheory: The paper provides upper and lower bounds on the minimum achievable difference between the expected number of mistakes made by the algorithm and the best expert. The authors also give efficient algorithms that achieve this minimum difference. The paper also discusses the implications of this result on the performance of batch learning algorithms in a PAC setting."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
