The method is based on the analysis of saturations of examples and generates a path structure, which is an expression of a stream of values processed by predicates. The paper introduces the concepts of extension and difference of path structure, which are used to express recursive clauses. Therefore, the paper is primarily focused on the development of a rule learning algorithm for inducing logic programs."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
