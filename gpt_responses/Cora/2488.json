The method is based on counting the number of events within each interval and then smoothing the number of events and the survival function separately over time via linear wavelet smoothers. The hazard rate function estimators are obtained by taking the ratio. The paper also proves that the estimators possess pointwise and global mean square consistency, obtain the best possible asymptotic MISE convergence rate and are also asymptotically normally distributed. These are all characteristics of probabilistic methods."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
