The network of these units can self-organize temporally structured responses to rhythmic patterns, embodying the perception of metrical structure. The paper discusses the implications of this approach for theories of metrical structure and musical expectancy, which are related to the learning and processing capabilities of neural networks."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
