The resulting hierarchical tree of clusters offers a new representation of protein sequences and families, which compares favorably with the most updated classifications based on functional and structural protein data. Motifs and domains such as the Zinc Finger, EF hand, Homeobox, EGF-like and others are automatically correctly identified. A novel representation of protein families is introduced, from which functional biological kinship of protein families can be deduced, as demonstrated for the transporters family."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
