These rules determine which model class is the most appropriate for a given learning task based on explicit conditions. \n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Theory because it discusses the problem of selecting the appropriate learning algorithm for a given task and proposes a solution that involves combining different model classes and dynamically selecting the most appropriate one. The paper also describes how the proposed approach will be evaluated to demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
