The paper also belongs to the sub-category of Rule Learning as it proposes a method for learning rules to avoid local learning in reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed method involves using a set of rules to guide the exploration of the environment and avoid getting stuck in local optima."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
