This CC is then used in combination with a supervised machine learning model to solve a problem. \n\nRule Learning: The paper combines the CC with two supervised learning models, ASOCS-AFE and ID3-AFE, which use the discrete classifications and other information to generate feedback and guide the CC into potentially more useful classifications of the continuous valued input features. This feedback loop is an example of rule learning."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
