The authors use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to model the chord progression and a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to learn the optimal sequence of chords. \n\nThe paper also belongs to the sub-category of Reinforcement Learning because the authors use an MDP to learn the optimal sequence of chords. The MDP is used to model the decision-making process of a musician who is trying to create a pleasing harmonic progression. The musician receives a reward for each chord in the sequence, and the goal is to maximize the total reward. The authors use Q-learning to learn the optimal policy for the MDP."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
