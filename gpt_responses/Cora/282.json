The authors also mention previous studies that have used neural network models to investigate perceptual framing.\n\nTheory: The paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding how cortical synchronization contributes to perceptual framing. The authors propose a model that integrates previous theories of cortical synchronization and perceptual processing, and they use this model to generate predictions about how perceptual framing should be affected by changes in cortical synchronization."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
