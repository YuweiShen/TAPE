The algorithms developed for measuring the degree of organization, symmetry, and lateralization in topographic map formation are also based on neural network principles.\n\nTheory: The paper develops a theoretical framework for measuring the degree of hemispheric organization and asymmetry of organization in a bihemispheric cerebral cortex. The measures developed are based on mathematical concepts and principles, such as sigmoid-type error averaging, and are tested for their performance in several topographic maps obtained by self-organization of an initially random network."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
