The paper presents a genetic encoding for a feature detector and describes an experiment where an optimal feature detector is found using the genetic algorithm. \n\nNeural Networks are also relevant, as the paper discusses the use of cellular neural networks in computer vision and the optimization of specific sub-modules of the system using genetic algorithms. The specific problem being investigated is character recognition using a conventional classifier network aided by an optimal feature detector."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
