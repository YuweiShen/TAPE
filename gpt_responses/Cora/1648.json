The authors abstract Bell's reasoning and understanding mechanisms that appear time and again in long-term creative design, and identify that the understanding mechanism is responsible for analogical anticipation of design constraints and analogical evaluation, beside case-based design. The new mechanisms are integrated in a computational model, ALEC1, that accounts for some creative behavior.\n- Theory: The paper discusses the mechanisms of reasoning and understanding in creative design, and proposes a computational model that accounts for some creative behavior. The authors also draw on well-documented examples, such as the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell, to support their arguments."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
