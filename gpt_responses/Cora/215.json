The authors propose storing specific instances in a CBR memory system to enhance the classification performance of the neural network. \n\nNeural Networks: The paper primarily focuses on the use of prototype-based incremental neural networks for classification tasks. The authors also propose a co-processing hybrid model that combines the neural network and CBR approaches."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
