The scoring functions are sets of decision trees that are combined to give a probability estimate, and the optimal segmentation of a DNA sequence into exons and introns is dependent on a separate scoring function that assigns a score reflecting the probability that a subsequence is an exon. Therefore, the paper primarily belongs to the sub-category of Probabilistic Methods in AI."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
