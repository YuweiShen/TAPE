The model selectively enhances neural activations to serially construct and update the internal representations of objects through correlation-based changes in synaptic weights.\n\nProbabilistic Methods: The correspondence problem between items in memory and elements in the visual input is resolved through a combination of top-down prediction signals and bottom-up grouping processes. This involves probabilistic methods for solving the motion correspondence problem."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
