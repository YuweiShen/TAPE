The authors mention the use of Bayesian methods and probabilistic graphical models to address this issue.\n\nTheory: The paper also delves into theoretical concepts such as generalization bounds and the bias-variance tradeoff. The authors discuss how these concepts can be used to analyze the performance of learning systems and to separate formal bounds from practical performance."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
