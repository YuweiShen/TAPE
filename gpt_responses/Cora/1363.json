The authors perform statistical tests on variants of the fixed-point distribution to infer structural information about the formula. \n\nTheory: The paper presents a new technique for exactly identifying certain classes of read-once Boolean formulas and applies it to prove the existence of short universal identification sequences for large classes of formulas. The authors also describe extensions of their algorithms to handle high rates of noise and to learn formulas of unbounded depth in Valiant's model with respect to specific distributions.
